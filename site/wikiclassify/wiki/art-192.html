				<span class='text'>He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the [[Baffin Island]] Inuit</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1887 he emigrated to the United States where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became professor of anthropology at [[Columbia University]] where he remained for the rest of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology</span>

				<span class='text'>Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions, but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;Among Boas's main contributions to anthropological thought was his rejection of the then popular evolutionary approaches to the study of culture, which saw all societies progressing through a set of hierarchic technological and cultural stages, with Western-European culture at the summit</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas argued that culture developed historically through the interactions of groups of people and the diffusion of ideas, and that consequently there was no process towards continuously &quot;higher&quot; cultural forms</span>
				<span class='text'>This insight led Boas to reject the &quot;stage&quot;-based organization of ethnological museums, instead preferring to order items on display based on the affinity and proximity of the cultural groups in question</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas also introduced the ideology of [[cultural relativism]] which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see the world through the lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms</span>
				<span class='text'>For Boas the object of anthropology was to understand the way in which culture conditioned people to understand and interact with the world in different ways, and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied</span>
				<span class='text'>By uniting the disciplines of [[archaeology]], the study of material culture and history, and [[physical anthropology]], the study of variation in human anatomy, with [[ethnology]], the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the [[Four field approach|four field subdivision]] of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century</span>

				<span class='text'>Boas's parents were educated, well-to-do, and liberal; they did not like dogma of any kind</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to this, Boas was granted the independence to think for himself and pursue his own interests</span>

				<span class='text'>e returned to Berlin to complete his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886, Boas defended (with Helmholtz's support) his [[habilitation]] thesis, ''Baffin Land'', and was named ''[[privatdozent]]'' in geography</span>
				<span class='text'>hile on Baffin Island he began to develop his interest in studying non-Western cultures (resulting in his book, ''The Central Eskimo'', published in 1888)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1885, Boas went to work with physical anthropologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Adolf Bastian]] at the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas had studied anatomy with Virchow two years earlier, while preparing for the Baffin Island expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, Virchow was involved in a vociferous debate over evolution with his former student, [[Ernst Haeckel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Haeckel had abandoned his medical practice to study comparative anatomy after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''The Origin of Species'', and vigorously promoted Darwin's ideas in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>However, like most other natural scientists prior to the rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]] in 1900 and the development of the [[modern synthesis]], Virchow felt that Darwin's theories were weak because they lacked a theory of cellular mutability</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, Virchow favored [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] models of evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>This debate resonated with debates among geographers</span>
				<span class='text'>Lamarckians believed that environmental forces could precipitate rapid and enduring changes in organisms that had no inherited source; thus, Lamarckians and environmental determinists often found themselves on the same side of debates</span>
				<span class='text'>ut Boas worked more closely with Bastian, who was noted for his antipathy to environmental determinism</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he argued for the &quot;psychic unity of mankind&quot;, a belief that all humans had the same intellectual capacity, and that all cultures were based on the same basic mental principles</span>
				<span class='text'>Variations in custom and belief, he argued, were the products of historical accidents</span>
				<span class='text'>This view resonated with Boas's experiences on Baffin Island, and drew him towards anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>hile at the Royal Ethnological Museum Boas became interested in the Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest, and after defending his habilitation thesis, he left for a three-month trip to British Columbia via New York</span>
				<span class='text'>In January&amp;nbsp;1887, he was offered a job as assistant editor of the journal ''Science''</span>
				<span class='text'>Alienated by growing [[antisemitism]] and [[nationalism]] as well as the very limited academic opportunities for a geographer in Germany, Boas decided to stay in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly he received additional motivation for this decision from his romance with Marie Krackowizer, whom he married in the same year</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1896, Boas was appointed Assistant Curator of Ethnology and [[Somatology]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] under Putnam</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1897, he organized the [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]], a five-year-long field-study of the natives of the Pacific Northwest, whose ancestors had migrated across the Bering Strait from Siberia</span>
				<span class='text'>He attempted to organize exhibits along contextual, rather than evolutionary, lines</span>
				<span class='text'>He also developed a research program in line with his curatorial goals: describing his instructions to his students in terms of widening contexts of interpretation within a society, he explained that &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>hey get the specimens; they get explanations of the specimens; they get connected texts that partly refer to the specimens and partly to abstract things concerning the people; and they get grammatical information&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These widening contexts of interpretation were abstracted into one context, the context in which the specimens, or assemblages of specimens, would be displayed: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>e want a collection arranged according to tribes, in order to teach the particular style of each group&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His approach, however, brought him into conflict with the President of the Museum, [[Morris Jesup]], and its director, [[Hermon Bumpus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1900 Boas had begun to retreat from American museum anthropology as a tool of education or reform (Hinsley 1992: 361)</span>
				<span class='text'>He resigned in 1905, never to work for a museum again</span>
				<span class='text'>=Fin de Siècle debates=={{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}===Science versus history===Some scholars, like Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]], believed that Boas used his research in physics as a model for his work in anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>Many others, however—including Boas's student [[Alexander Lesser]], and later researchers such as [[Marian W</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith]], [[Herbert S</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis]], and [[Matti Bunzl]]—have pointed out that Boas explicitly rejected physics in favor of history as a model for his anthropological research</span>
				<span class='text'>his distinction between science and history has its origins in 19th-century German academe, which distinguished between ''Naturwissenschaften'' (the sciences) and ''Geisteswissenschaften'' (the humanities), or between ''Gesetzwissenschaften'' (jurisprudence) and ''Geschichtswissenschaften'' (history, historiography)</span>
				<span class='text'>Generally, ''Naturwissenschaften'' and ''Gesetzwissenschaften'' refer to the study of phenomena that are governed by objective natural laws, while the latter terms in the two oppositions refer to those phenomena that have meaning only in terms of human perception or experience</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1884, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] philosopher [[Wilhelm Windelband]] coined the terms [[nomothetic]] and [[idiographic]] to describe these two divergent approaches</span>
				<span class='text'>He observed that most scientists employ some mix of both, but in differing proportions; he considered physics a perfect example of a nomothetic science, and history, an idiographic science</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he argued that each approach has its origin in one of the two &quot;interests&quot; of reason [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had identified in the ''Critique of Judgement''—one &quot;generalizing&quot;, the other &quot;specifying&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(Winkelband's student [[Heinrich Rickert]] elaborated on this distinction in ''The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science : A Logical Introduction to the Historical Sciences''; Boas's students [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Edward Sapir]] relied extensively on this work in defining their own approach to anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Kant considered these two interests of reason to be objective and universal, the distinction between the natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment</span>
				<span class='text'>In Germany the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality</span>
				<span class='text'>In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1795, the great [[Linguistics|linguist]] and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Humboldt founded the [[University of Berlin]] in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas's intellectual orientation matured</span>
				<span class='text'>istorians working in the Humboldtian tradition developed ideas that would become central in Boasian anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Leopold von Ranke]] defined the task of the historian as &quot;merely to show as it actually was&quot;, which is a cornerstone of Boas's empiricism</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] emphasized the centrality of &quot;understanding&quot; to human knowledge, and that the lived experience of an historian could provide a basis for an empathic understanding of the situation of an historical actor</span>

				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For Boas, both values were well-expressed in a quote from Goethe: &quot;A single action or event is interesting, not because it is explainable, but because it is true</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}The influence of these ideas on Boas is apparent in his 1887 essay, &quot;The Study of Geography,&quot; in which he distinguished between physical science, which seeks to discover the laws governing phenomena, and historical science, which seeks a thorough understanding of phenomena on their own terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas argued that geography is and must be historical in this sense</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1887, after his Baffin Island expedition, Boas wrote &quot;The Principles of Ethnological Classification&quot;, in which he developed this argument in application to anthropology::Ethnological phenomena are the result of the physical and psychical character of men, and of its development under the influence of the surroundings </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'Surroundings' are the physical conditions of the country, and the sociological phenomena, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;the relation of man to man</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, the study of the present surroundings is insufficient: the history of the people, the influence of the regions through which it has passed on its migrations, and the people with whom it came into contact, must be considered</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}This formulation echoes Ratzel's focus on historical processes of human migration and culture contact, and Bastian's rejection of environmental determinism</span>
				<span class='text'>It also emphasizes culture as a context (&quot;surroundings&quot;), and the importance of history</span>
				<span class='text'>These are the hallmarks of Boasian anthropology (which [[Marvin Harris]] would later call &quot;historical-particularism&quot;), would guide Boas's research over the next decade, as well as his instructions to future students</span>
				<span class='text'>(see Lewis 2001b for an alternative view to Harris'</span>
				<span class='text'>Although context and history were essential elements to Boas's understanding of anthropology as ''Geisteswissenschaften'' and ''Geschichtswissenschaften'', there is one essential element that Boasian anthropology shares with ''Naturwissenschaften'': empiricism</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1949, Boas's student, [[Alfred Kroeber]] summed up the principles of empiricism that define Boasian anthropology as a science:# The method of science is to begin with questions, not with answers, least of all with value judgements</span>
				<span class='text'> Science is dispassionate inquiry and therefore cannot take over outright any ideologies &quot;already formulated in everyday life&quot;, since these are themselves inevitably traditional and normally tinged with emotional prejudice</span>
				<span class='text'> Sweeping all-or-none, black-and-white judgements are characteristic of categorical attitudes and have no place in science, whose very nature is inferential and judicious</span>
				<span class='text'>==Orthogenetic versus Darwinian evolution===One of the greatest accomplishments of Boas and his students was their critique of theories of physical, social, and cultural evolution current at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>This critique is central to Boas's work in museums, as well as his work in all four fields of anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>As historian [[George W</span>
				<span class='text'>Stocking, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>George Stocking]] noted, however, Boas's main project was to distinguish between biological and cultural heredity, and to focus on the cultural processes that he believed had the greatest influence over social life</span>

				<span class='text'>264&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Boas supported Darwinian theory, although he did not assume that it automatically applied to cultural and historical phenomena (and indeed was a lifelong opponent of 19th-century theories of [[cultural evolution]], such as those of [[Lewis&amp;nbsp;H</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Morgan]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alexander Lesser, 1981 &quot;Franz Boas&quot; p</span>
				<span class='text'>25 in Sydel Silverman, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>''From Totems to Teachers'' New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of evolution that the Boasians ridiculed and rejected was the then dominant belief in [[orthogenesis]]—a determinate or [[teleology|teleological]] process of evolution in which change occurs progressively regardless of [[natural selection]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas rejected the prevalent theories of [[social evolution]] developed by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], and [[Herbert Spencer]] not because he rejected the notion of &quot;evolution&quot; per se, but because he rejected orthogenetic notions of evolution in favor of Darwinian evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>he difference between these prevailing theories of cultural evolution and Darwinian theory cannot be overstated: the orthogeneticists argued that all societies progress through the same stages in the same sequence</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, although the [[Inuit]] with whom Boas worked at [[Baffin Island]], and the [[German people|Germans]] with whom he studied as a graduate student, were contemporaries of one another, evolutionists argued that the Inuit were at an earlier stage in their evolution, and Germans at a later stage</span>
				<span class='text'>This echoed a popular misreading of Darwin that suggested that human beings are descended from [[chimpanzee]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Darwin argued that chimpanzees and humans are equally evolved</span>
				<span class='text'>What characterizes Darwinian theory is its attention to the ''processes'' by which one species transforms into another; &quot;adaptation&quot; as a key principle in explaining the relationship between a species and its environment; and &quot;natural selection&quot; as a mechanism of change</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, Morgan, Spencer, and Tylor had little to say about the process and mechanics of change</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, Darwin built up his theory through a careful examination of considerable empirical data</span>
				<span class='text'>Boasian research revealed that virtually every claim made by cultural evolutionists was contradicted by the data, or reflected a profound misinterpretation of the data</span>
				<span class='text'>As Boas's student [[Robert Lowie]] remarked, &quot;Contrary to some misleading statements on the subject, there have been no responsible opponents of evolution as 'scientifically proved', though there has been determined hostility to an evolutionary metaphysics that falsifies the established facts&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n an unpublished lecture, Boas characterized his debt to Darwin thus::Although the idea does not appear quite definitely expressed in Darwin's discussion of the development of mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection</span>
				<span class='text'>This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>hus, Boas suggested that what appear to be patterns or structures in a culture were not a product of conscious design, but rather the outcome of diverse mechanisms that produce cultural variation (such as diffusion and independent invention), shaped by the social environment in which people live and act</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas concluded his lecture by acknowledging the importance of Darwin's work::I hope I may have succeeded in presenting to you, however imperfectly, the currents of thought due to the work of the immortal Darwin which have helped to make anthropology what it is at the present time</span>
				<span class='text'>(Boas, 1909 lecture; see Lewis 2001b</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early career: museum studies=={{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}In the late 19th century anthropology in the United States was dominated by the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], directed by [[John Wesley Powell]], a geologist who favored [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]</span>

				<span class='text'>([[Kwakiutl]] culture)]]It was while working on museum collections and exhibitions that Boas formulated his basic approach to culture, which led him to break with museums and seek to establish anthropology as an academic discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this period Boas made five more trips to the Pacific Northwest</span>
				<span class='text'>His continuing field research led him to think of culture as a local context for human action</span>
				<span class='text'>His emphasis on local context and history led him to oppose the dominant model at the time, [[cultural evolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>oas initially broke with evolutionary theory over the issue of kinship</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] had argued that all human societies move from an initial form of [[matrilineal]] organization to [[patrilineal]] organization</span>
				<span class='text'>First Nations groups on the northern coast of British Columbia, like the [[Tsimshian]] and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], were organized into matrilineal clans</span>
				<span class='text'>First Nations on the southern coast, like the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] and the [[Coast Salish peoples|Salish]], however, were organized into patrilineal groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas focused on the [[Kwakiutl]], who lived between the two clusters</span>
				<span class='text'>The Kwakiutl seemed to have a mix of features</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to marriage, a man would assume his wife's father's name and crest</span>
				<span class='text'>His children took on these names and crests as well, although his sons would lose them when they got married</span>
				<span class='text'>Names and crests thus stayed in the mother's line</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, Boas—like Morgan before him—suggested that the Kwakiutl had been matrilineal like their neighbors to the north, but that they were beginning to evolve patrilineal groups</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1897, however, he repudiated himself, and argued that the Kwakiutl were changing from a prior patrilineal organization to a matrilineal one, as they learned about matrilineal principles from their northern neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>oas's rejection of Morgan's theories led him, in an 1887 article, to challenge Mason's principles of museum display</span>
				<span class='text'>At stake, however, were more basic issues of causality and classification</span>
				<span class='text'>The evolutionary approach to material culture led museum curators to organize objects on display according to function or level of technological development</span>
				<span class='text'>Curators assumed that changes in the forms of artefacts reflect some natural process of progressive evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas, however, felt that the form an artefact took reflected the circumstances under which it was produced and used</span>
				<span class='text'>Arguing that &quot;[t]hough like causes have like effects, like effects have not like causes&quot;, Boas realized that even artefacts that were similar in form might have developed in very different contexts, for different reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>Mason's museum displays, organized along evolutionary lines, mistakenly juxtapose like effects; those organized along contextual lines would reveal like causes</span>
				<span class='text'>==Minik Wallace===In his capacity as Assistant Curator at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], Franz Boas requested that Arctic explorer [[Robert E</span>
				<span class='text'>Peary]] bring one Inuk from Greenland to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Peary obliged and brought six Inuit to New York in 1897 who lived in the basement of the American Museum of Natural History</span>
				<span class='text'>Four of them died from tuberculosis within a year of arriving in New York, with the exception of one young boy, [[Minik Wallace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas staged a funeral for the father of the boy, and instead of resting the remains in peace, Boas had the remains dissected and placed in the museum</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Minik Wallace realized that his father's bones were kept at the museum and requested their return</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas then no longer worked at the museum, but the museum did not want to return the bones</span>
				<span class='text'>Minik eventually was able to return to Greenland, but Boas did not help him or pay any attention to the plight of the Inuit whom he had brought to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas has been widely critiqued for his role in bringing Minik and the five other Inuit to New York, and his disinterest in them once they had served their purpose at the museum</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During this time Boas played a key role in organizing the American Anthropological Association&amp;nbsp;(AAA) as an umbrella organization for the emerging field</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas originally wanted the AAA to be limited to professional anthropologists, but W</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;J</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;McGee (another geologist who had joined the BAE under Powell's leadership) argued that the organization should have an open membership</span>
				<span class='text'>McGee's position prevailed and he was elected the organization's first president in 1902; Boas was elected a vice-president, along with Putnam, Powell, and Holmes</span>
				<span class='text'>t both Columbia and the AAA, Boas encouraged the &quot;four field&quot; concept of anthropology; he personally contributed to [[physical anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], as well as [[cultural anthropology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work in these fields was pioneering: in physical anthropology he led scholars away from static taxonomical classifications of race, to an emphasis on human biology and evolution; in linguistics he broke through the limitations of classic [[philology]] and established some of the central problems in modern linguistics and cognitive anthropology; in cultural anthropology he (along with Polish-English anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]]) established the contextualist approach to culture, cultural relativism, and the participant-observation method of fieldwork</span>
				<span class='text'>he four-field approach understood not merely as bringing together different kinds of anthropologists into one department, but as reconceiving anthropology through the integration of different objects of anthropological research into one overarching object, was one of Boas's fundamental contributions to the discipline, and came to characterize American anthropology against that of[[England]], [[France]], or [[Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This approach defines as its object the human species as a totality</span>
				<span class='text'>This focus did not lead Boas to seek to reduce all forms of humanity and human activity to some lowest common denominator; rather, he understood the essence of the human species to be the tremendous variation in human form and activity (an approach that parallels Charles Darwin's approach to species in general)</span>
				<span class='text'>n his 1907 essay, &quot;Anthropology&quot;, Boas identified two basic questions for anthropologists: &quot;Why are the tribes and nations of the world different, and how have the present differences developed?&quot; Amplifying these questions, he explained the object of anthropological study thus::We do not discuss the anatomical, physiological, and mental characteristics of man considered as an individual; but we are interested in the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes</span>
				<span class='text'>It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past</span>
				<span class='text'>hese questions signal a marked break from then-current ideas about human diversity, which assumed that some people have a history, evident in a historical (or written) record, while other people, lacking writing, also lack history</span>
				<span class='text'>For some, this distinction between two different kinds of societies explained the difference between history, sociology, economics and other disciplines that focus on people with writing, and anthropology, which was supposed to focus on people without writing</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas rejected this distinction between kinds of societies, and this division of labor in the academy</span>
				<span class='text'>He understood all societies to have a history, and all societies to be proper objects of anthropological society</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to approach literate and non-literate societies the same way, he emphasized the importance on studying human history through the analysis of other things besides written texts</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, in his 1904 article, &quot;The History of Anthropology&quot;, Boas wrote that:The historical development of the work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the biological history of mankind in all its varieties; linguistics applied to people without written languages; the ethnology of people without historic records; and prehistoric archeology</span>
				<span class='text'>istorians and social theorists in the 18th and 19th centuries had speculated as to the causes of this differentiation, but Boas dismissed these theories, especially the dominant theories of [[social evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]] as speculative</span>
				<span class='text'>He endeavored to establish a discipline that would base its claims on rigorous empirical study</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of Boas's most important books, ''[[The Mind of Primitive Man]]'' (1911), integrated his theories concerning the history and development of cultures and established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years</span>
				<span class='text'>In this study he established that in any given population, biology, language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, he established that culture does not depend on any independent variables</span>
				<span class='text'>He emphasized that the biological, linguistic, and cultural traits of any group of people are the product of historical developments involving both cultural and non-cultural forces</span>
				<span class='text'>He established that cultural plurality is a fundamental feature of humankind, and that the specific cultural environment structures much individual behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>oas also presented himself as a role model for the citizen-scientist, who understand that even were the truth pursued as its own end, all knowledge has moral consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Mind of Primitive Man'' ends with an appeal to [[humanism]]::I hope the discussions outlined in these pages have shown that the data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, that we should learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with a conviction that, as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind if we are only willing to give them a fair opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>==Physical anthropology===Boas's work in [[physical anthropology]] brought together his interest in Darwinian evolution with his interest in migration as a cause of change</span>
				<span class='text'>His most important research in this field was his study of changes in body form among children of immigrants in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Other researchers had already noted differences in height, cranial measurements, and other physical features between Americans and people from different parts of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Many used these differences to argue that there is an innate biological difference between races</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas's primary interest—in symbolic and material culture and in language—was the study of processes of change; he therefore set out to determine whether bodily forms are also subject to processes of change</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas studied 17,821 people, divided into seven ethno-national groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas found that average measures of cranial size of immigrants were significantly different from members of these groups who were born in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he discovered that average measures of cranial size of children born within ten years of their mothers' arrival were significantly different from those of children born more than ten years after their mothers' arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas did not deny that physical features such as height or cranial size were inherited; he did, however, argue that the environment has an influence on these features, which is expressed through change over time</span>
				<span class='text'>This work was central to his influential argument that differences between races were not immutable</span>

				<span class='text'>df THE MEANING AND CONSEQUENCES OF MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION]&lt;/ref&gt;Although some [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have suggested that Boas was opposed to Darwinian evolution, Boas in fact was a committed proponent of Darwinian evolutionary thought</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1888, he declared that &quot;the development of ethnology is largely due to the general recognition of the principle of biological evolution&quot;; since Boas's times, physical anthropologists have established that the human capacity for culture is a product of human evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Boas's research on changes in body form played an important role in the rise of Darwinian theory</span>
				<span class='text'>It is crucial to remember that Boas was trained at a time when biologists had no understanding of genetics; [[Mendelian genetics]] became widely known only after 1900</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to that time biologists relied on the measurement of physical traits as empirical data for any theory of evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas's biometric studies, however, led him to question the use of this method and kind of data</span>
				<span class='text'>In a speech to anthropologists in Berlin in 1912, Boas argued that at best such statistics could only raise biological questions, and not answer them</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in this context that anthropologists began turning to genetics as a basis for any understanding of biological variation</span>
				<span class='text'>==Linguistics===Boas also contributed greatly to the foundation of linguistics as a science in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He published many descriptive studies of Native American languages, and wrote on theoretical difficulties in classifying languages, and laid out a research program for studying the relations between language and culture which his students such as [[Edward Sapir]], [[Paul Rivet]], and [[Alfred Kroeber]] followed</span>

				<span class='text'>269–280&lt;/ref&gt;His 1889 article &quot;On Alternating Sounds&quot;, however, made a singular contribution to the methodology of both linguistics and cultural anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a response to a paper presented in 1888 by [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]], at the time a professor of American linguistics and archeology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Brinton observed that in the spoken languages of many Native Americans, certain sounds regularly alternated</span>
				<span class='text'>This is clearly not a function of individual accents; Brinton was not suggesting that some individuals pronounced certain words differently from others</span>
				<span class='text'>He was arguing that there were many words that, even when repeated by the same speaker, varied considerably in their vocalization</span>
				<span class='text'>Using [[evolutionary theory]], Brinton argued that this pervasive inconsistency was a sign of linguistic inferiority, and evidence that Native Americans were at a low stage in their evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>oas was familiar with what Brinton was talking about; he had experienced something similar during his research in Baffin Island and in the Pacific Northwest</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he argued that &quot;alternating sounds&quot; is not at all a feature of Native American languages—indeed, he argued, they do not really exist</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than take alternating sounds as objective proof of different stages in cultural evolution, Boas considered them in terms of his longstanding interest in the subjective perception of objective physical phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>He also considered his earlier critique of evolutionary museum displays</span>
				<span class='text'>There, he pointed out that two things (artefacts of material culture) that appear to be similar may in fact be quite different</span>
				<span class='text'>In this article he raises the possibility that two things (sounds) that appear to be different may in fact be the same</span>
				<span class='text'>n short, he shifted attention to the ''perception'' of different sounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, is it because they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes that he is not concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness</span>
				<span class='text'>He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way</span>
				<span class='text'>This is crucial for research in descriptive [[linguistics]]: when studying a new language, how are we to note the [[pronunciation]] of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between [[phonemics]] and [[phonetics]]</span>
				<span class='text'> People may pronounce a word in a variety of ways and still recognize that they are using the same word</span>
				<span class='text'>The issue, then, is not &quot;that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality&quot; (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds &quot;are classified according to their similarity&quot; (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category)</span>
				<span class='text'>A comparable visual example would involve words for colors</span>
				<span class='text'>The English word &quot;green&quot; can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints</span>
				<span class='text'>But there are some languages that have no word for &quot;[[green]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Bretnt and Paul Kay 1969 ''Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution''&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, people might classify what we would call &quot;green&quot; as either &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This is not an example of color-blindness—people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers</span>
				<span class='text'>oas applied these principles to his studies of [[Inuit languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Researchers have reported a variety of spellings for a given word</span>
				<span class='text'>In the past, researchers have interpreted this data in a number of ways—it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different [[dialect]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit pronounce the word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not that English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the phonetic system of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Boas was making a very specific contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture</span>
				<span class='text'>As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that what appeared to be evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority</span>
				<span class='text'>This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's [[cultural relativism]]: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cultural anthropology===[[File:Boas Kwakiutl mask drawing - cropped</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Drawing of a [[Kwakiutl]] mask from Boas's ''The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians'' (1897)</span>
				<span class='text'>Wooden skulls hang from below the mask, which represents one of the cannibal bird helpers of Bakbakwalinooksiwey</span>
				<span class='text'>]The essence of Boas's approach to ethnography is found in his early essay on &quot;The Study of Geography&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>There he argued for an approach that:</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>considers every phenomena as worthy of being studied for its own sake</span>
				<span class='text'>Its mere existence entitles it to a full share of our attention; and the knowledge of its existence and evolution in space and time fully satisfies the student</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Boas's student [[Ruth Benedict]] gave her presidential address to the American Anthropological Association in 1947, she reminded anthropologists of the importance of this [[idiographic]] stance by quoting literary critic A</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;C</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Bradley: &quot;We watch 'what is', seeing that so it happened and must have happened&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>his orientation led Boas to promote a cultural anthropology characterized by a strong commitment to* [[Empiricism]] (with a resulting skepticism of attempts to formulate &quot;scientific laws&quot; of culture)* A notion of [[culture]] as fluid and dynamic* [[ethnography|Ethnographic]] fieldwork, in which the anthropologist resides for an extended period among the people being researched, conducts research in the native language, and collaborates with native researchers, as a method of collecting data, and* [[Cultural relativism]] as a methodological tool while conducting fieldwork, and as heuristic tool while analyzing data</span>
				<span class='text'>oas argued that in order to understand &quot;what is&quot;—in cultural anthropology, the specific cultural traits (behaviors, beliefs, and symbols)—one had to examine them in their local context</span>
				<span class='text'>He also understood that as people migrate from one place to another, and as the cultural context changes over time, the elements of a culture, and their meanings, will change, which led him to emphasize the importance of local histories for an analysis of cultures</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough other anthropologists at the time, such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown]] focused on the study of societies, which they understood to be clearly bounded, Boas's attention to history, which reveals the extent to which traits diffuse from one place to another, led him to view cultural boundaries as multiple and overlapping, and as highly permeable</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Boas's student [[Robert Lowie]] once described culture as a thing of &quot;shreds and patches&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas and his students understood that as people try to make sense of their world they seek to integrate its disparate elements, with the result that different cultures could be characterized as having different configurations or patterns</span>
				<span class='text'>But Boasians also understood that such integration was always in tensions with diffusion, and any appearance of a stable configuration is contingent (see Bashkow 2004: 445)</span>
				<span class='text'>uring Boas's lifetime, as today, many Westerners saw a fundamental difference between modern societies, which are characterized by dynamism and individualism, and traditional societies which are stable and homogeneous</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas's empirical field research, however, led him to argue against this comparison</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, his 1903 essay, &quot;Decorative Designs of Alaskan Needlecases: A History of Conventional Designs, Based on Materials in a U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Museum&quot;, provides another example of how Boas made broad theoretical claims based on a detailed analysis of empirical data</span>
				<span class='text'>After establishing formal similarities among the needlecases, Boas shows how certain formal features provide a vocabulary out of which individual artisans could create variations in design</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, his emphasis on culture as a context for meaningful action made him sensitive to individual variation within a society ([[William Henry Holmes]] suggested a similar point in an 1886 paper, &quot;Origin and development of form and ornament in ceramic art&quot;, although unlike Boas he did not develop the ethnographic and theoretical implications)</span>
				<span class='text'>n a programmatic essay in 1920, &quot;The Methods of Ethnology&quot;, Boas argued that instead of &quot;the systematic enumeration of standardized beliefs and customs of a tribe&quot;, anthropology needs to document &quot;the way in which the individual reacts to his whole social environment, and to the difference of opinion and of mode of action that occur in primitive society and which are the causes of far-reaching changes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas argued that attention to individual agency reveals that &quot;the activities of the individual are determined to a great extent by his social environment, but in turn his own activities influence the society in which he lives, and may bring about modifications in form&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Boas thought of culture as fundamentally dynamic: &quot;As soon as these methods are applied, primitive society loses the appearance of absolute stability </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>All cultural forms rather appear in a constant state of flux</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (see Lewis 2001b)Having argued against the relevance of the distinction between literate and non-literate societies as a way of defining anthropology's object of study, Boas argued that non-literate and literate societies should be analyzed in the same way</span>
				<span class='text'>Nineteenth-century historians had been applying the techniques of [[philology]] to reconstruct the histories of, and relationships between, literate societies</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to apply these methods to non-literate societies, Boas argued that the task of fieldworkers is to produce and collect texts in non-literate societies</span>
				<span class='text'>This took the form not only of compiling lexicons and grammars of the local language, but of recording myths, folktales, beliefs about social relationships and institutions, and even recipes for local cuisine</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to do this, Boas relied heavily on the collaboration of literate native ethnographers (among the Kwakiutl, most often [[George Hunt (ethnologist)|George Hunt]]), and he urged his students to consider such people valuable partners, inferior in their standing in Western society, but superior in their understanding of their own culture</span>
				<span class='text'>(see Bunzl 2004: 438–439)Using these methods, Boas published another article in 1920, in which he revisited his earlier research on Kwakiutl kinship</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1890s Boas had tried to reconstruct transformation in the organization of Kwakiutl clans, by comparing them to the organization of clans in other societies neighboring the Kwakiutl to the north and south</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, however, he argued against translating the Kwakiutl principle of kin groups into any English word</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of trying to fit the Kwakiutl into some larger model, he tried to understand their beliefs and practices in their own terms</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, whereas he had earlier translated the Kwakiutl word ''numaym'' as &quot;clan&quot;, he now argued that the word is best understood as referring to a bundle of privileges, for which there is no English word</span>
				<span class='text'>Men secured claims to these privileges through their parents or wives, and there were a variety of ways these privileges could be acquired, used, and transmitted from one generation to the next</span>
				<span class='text'>As in his work on alternating sounds, Boas had come to realize that different ethnological interpretations of Kwakiutl kinship were the result of the limitations of Western categories</span>
				<span class='text'>As in his work on Alaskan needlecases, he now saw variation among Kwakiutl practices as the result of the play between social norms and individual creativity</span>

				<span class='text'>=Franz Boas and folklore==Franz Boas was an immensely influential figure throughout the development of [[folklore]] as a discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>At first glance, it might seem that his only concern was for the discipline of anthropology—after all, he fought for most of his life to keep folklore as a part of anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Boas was motivated by his desire to see both anthropology and folklore become more professional and well-respected</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas was afraid that if folklore was allowed to become its own discipline the standards for folklore scholarship would be lowered</span>
				<span class='text'>This, combined with the scholarships of &quot;amateurs&quot;, would lead folklore to be completely discredited, Boas believed</span>
				<span class='text'>n order to further professionalize folklore, Boas introduced the strict scientific methods which he learned in college to the discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas championed the use of exhaustive research, fieldwork, and strict scientific guidelines in folklore scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas believed that a true theory could only be formed from thorough research, and that even once you had a theory it should be treated as a &quot;work in progress&quot; unless it could be proved beyond doubt</span>
				<span class='text'>This rigid scientific methodology was eventually accepted as one of the major tenets of folklore scholarship, and Boas's methods remain in use even today</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas also nurtured many budding folklorists during his time as a professor, and some of his students are counted among the most notable minds in folklore scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>oas was passionate about the collection of folklore, and believed that the similarity of folktales amongst different folk groups was due to dissemination</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas strove to prove this theory, and his efforts produced a method for breaking a folktale into parts and then analyzing these parts</span>
				<span class='text'>His creation of &quot;catch-words&quot; allowed for categorization of these parts, and the ability to analyze them in relation to other similar tales</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas also fought to prove that not all cultures progressed along the same path, and that, therefore, cultures unlike those of Europe were not primitive, but different</span>
				<span class='text'>oas remained active in the development and scholarship of folklore throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He became the editor of the ''Journal of American Folklore'' in 1908, regularly wrote and published articles on folklore (often in the ''Journal of American Folklore''), and helped to elect Louise Pound as president of the American Folklore Society in 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>=Scientist as activist==:There are two things to which I am devoted: absolute academic and spiritual freedom, and the subordination of the state to the interests of the individual; expressed in other forms, the furthering of conditions in which the individual can develop to the best of his ability—as far as it is possible with a full understanding of the fetters imposed upon us by tradition; and the fight against all forms of power policy of states or private organizations</span>
				<span class='text'>This means a devotion to principles of true democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>I object to teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be</span>
				<span class='text'>(letter from Boas to [[John Dewey]], 11/6/39)Boas was known for passionately defending what he believed to be right</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Many social scientists in other disciplines often agonize over the legitimacy of their work as &quot;science&quot;, and consequently emphasize the importance of detachment, objectivity, abstraction, and quantifiability in their work</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps because Boas, like other early anthropologists, was originally trained in the natural sciences, he and his students never expressed such anxiety</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he did not believe that detachment, objectivity, and quantifiability were required to make anthropology scientific</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the object of study of anthropologists is different from the object of study of physicists, he assumed that anthropologists would have to employ different methods and different criteria for evaluating their research</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Boas used statistical studies to demonstrate the extent to which variation in data is context-dependent, and argued that the context-dependent nature of human variation rendered many abstractions and generalizations that had been passing as scientific understandings of humankind (especially theories of social evolution popular at the time) in fact unscientific</span>
				<span class='text'>His understanding of ethnographic fieldwork began with the fact that the objects of ethnographic study (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;the [[Inuit]] of [[Baffin Island]]) were not just objects, but subjects, and his research called attention to their creativity and agency</span>
				<span class='text'>More importantly, he viewed the Inuit as his teachers, thus reversing the typical hierarchical relationship between scientist and object of study</span>
				<span class='text'>his emphasis on the relationship between anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the prism of their culture</span>
				<span class='text'>his emphasis also led Boas to conclude that anthropologists have an obligation to speak out on social issues</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas was especially concerned with [[racism|racial inequality]], which his research had indicated is not biological in origin, but rather social</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas is credited as the first scientist to publish the idea that all people—including white and African-Americans—are equal</span>
				<span class='text'>He often emphasized his abhorrence of racism, and used his work to show that there was no scientific basis for such a bias</span>
				<span class='text'>An early example of this concern is evident in his 1906 commencement address to [[Atlanta University]], at the invitation of [[W</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;E</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;B</span>
				<span class='text'>Du&amp;nbsp;Bois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas began by remarking that &quot;If you did accept the view that the present weakness of the American Negro, his uncontrollable emotions, his lack of energy, are racially inherent, your work would still be noble one&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He then went on, however, to argue against this view</span>
				<span class='text'>To the claim that European and Asian civilizations are, at the time, more advanced than African societies, Boas objected that against the total history of humankind, the past two thousand years is but a brief span</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, although the technological advances of our early ancestors (such as taming fire and inventing stone tools) might seem insignificant when compared to the invention of the steam engine or control over electricity, we should consider that they might actually be even greater accomplishments</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas then went on to catalogue advances in Africa, such as smelting iron, cultivating millet, and domesticating chickens and cattle, that occurred in Africa well before they spread to Europe and Asia (evidence now suggests that chickens were first domesticated in Asia; the original domestication of [[Bos|cattle]] is under debate)</span>
				<span class='text'>He then described the activities of African kings, diplomats, merchants, and artists as evidence of cultural achievement</span>
				<span class='text'>From this, he concluded, any social inferiority of Negroes in the United States cannot be explained by their African origins::If, therefore, it is claimed that your race is doomed to economic inferiority, you may confidently look to the home of your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent</span>
				<span class='text'>You may say that you go to work with bright hopes, and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained</span>
				<span class='text'>oas proceeds to discuss the arguments for the inferiority of the &quot;Negro race&quot;, and calls attention to the fact that they were brought to the Americas through force</span>
				<span class='text'>For Boas, this is just one example of the many times conquest or colonialism has brought different peoples into an unequal relation, and he mentions &quot;the conquest of England by the Normans, the Teutonic invasion of Italy, [and] the Manchoo conquest of China&quot; as resulting in similar conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>But the best example, for Boas, of this phenomenon is that of the Jews in Europe::Even now there lingers in the consciousness of the old, sharper divisions which the ages had not been able to efface, and which is strong enough to find—not only here and there—expression as antipathy to the Jewish type</span>
				<span class='text'>In France, that let down the barriers more than a hundred years ago, the feeling of antipathy is still strong enough to sustain an anti-Jewish political party</span>
				<span class='text'>oas's closing advice is that [[African-Americans]] should not look to whites for approval or encouragement, because people in power usually take a very long time to learn to sympathize with people out of power</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Remember that in every single case in history the process of adaptation has been one of exceeding slowness</span>
				<span class='text'>Do not look for the impossible, but do not let your path deviate from the quiet and steadfast insistence on full opportunities for your powers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Despite Boas's caveat about the intractability of white prejudice, he also considered it the scientist's responsibility to argue against white myths of racial purity and racial superiority, and to use the evidence of his research to fight racism</span>
				<span class='text'>oas was also critical of one nation imposing its power over others</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916 Boas wrote a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'' which was published under the headline, &quot;Why German-Americans Blame America&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Boas did begin the letter by protesting bitter attacks against German-Americans at the time of the war in Europe, most of his letter was a critique of American nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;In my youth I had been taught in school and at home not only to love the good of my own country, but also to seek to understand and to respect the individualities of other nations</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason one-sided nationalism, that is so often found nowadays, is to me unendurable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He writes of his love for American ideals of freedom, and of his growing discomfort with American beliefs about its own superiority over others</span>
				<span class='text'>I have always been of the opinion that we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in utilizing the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideals may be to ours </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call &quot;our free institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy</span>
				<span class='text'>That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishis is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism</span>
				<span class='text'>I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Boas felt that scientists have a responsibility to speak out on social and political problems, he was appalled that they might involve themselves in disingenuous and deceitful ways</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, in 1919, when he discovered that four anthropologists, in the course of their research in other countries, were serving as spies for the American government, he wrote an angry letter to ''[[The Nation]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is perhaps in this letter that he most clearly expresses his understanding of his commitment to science::A soldier whose business is murder as a fine art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies</span>
				<span class='text'>They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms</span>
				<span class='text'>Not so the scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>The very essence of his life is the service of truth</span>
				<span class='text'>We all know scientists who in private life do not come up to the standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches</span>
				<span class='text'>It is bad enough if we have to put up with these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work</span>
				<span class='text'>A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Boas did not name the spies in question, he was referring to a group led by [[Sylvanus G</span>

				<span class='text'>While conducting research in [[Mexico]], Morley and his colleagues looked for evidence of German submarine bases, and collected intelligence on Mexican political figures and [[German immigrants in Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>oas's stance against spying took place in the context of his struggle to establish a new model for academic anthropology at Columbia University</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously, American anthropology was based at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas's students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication ''[[American Anthropologist]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[National Academy of Sciences]] established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which scientists could assist the United States government prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;H</span>
				<span class='text'>Holmes (who had gotten the job of Director at the [[Field Museum]] for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a protégé of Holmes</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Boas's letter was published, Holmes wrote to a friend complaining about &quot;the Prussian control of anthropology in this country&quot; and the need to end Boas's &quot;Hun regime&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>149</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion was influenced by anti-German and probably also by anti-Jewish sentiment</span>
				<span class='text'>The Anthropological Society of Washington passed a resolution condemning Boas's letter for unjustly criticizing President Wilson; attacking the principles of American democracy; and endangering anthropologists abroad, who would now be suspected of being spies (a charge that was especially insulting, given that his concerns about this very issue were what had prompted Boas to write his letter in the first place)</span>
				<span class='text'>This resolution was passed on to the [[American Anthropological Association]]&amp;nbsp;(AAA) and the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Members of the American Anthropological Association (among whom Boas was a founding member in 1902), meeting at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at Harvard (with which Morley, Lothrop, and Spinden were affiliated), voted by 20 to 10 to censure Boas</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Boas resigned as the AAA's representative to the NRC, although he remained an active member of the AAA</span>
				<span class='text'>The AAA's censure of Boas was not rescinded until 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>oas continued to speak out against racism and for intellectual freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Naziism|Nazi Party]] in Germany denounced &quot;[[Deutsche Physik|Jewish Science]]&quot; (which included not only Boasian Anthropology but [[Freudian psychoanalysis]] and [[Einsteinian]] physics), Boas responded with a public statement signed by over 8,000 other scientists, declaring that there is only one science, to which race and religion are irrelevant</span>
				<span class='text'>After World War&amp;nbsp;I, Boas created the Emergency Society for German and Austrian Science</span>
				<span class='text'>This organization was originally dedicated to fostering friendly relations between American and German and Austrian scientists and for providing research funding to German scientists who had been adversely affected by the war,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert F</span>

				<span class='text'>With the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], Boas assisted German scientists in fleeing the Nazi regime</span>
				<span class='text'>Boas helped these scientists not only to escape, but to secure positions once they arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2001:458-59&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Boas addressed an open letter to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in protest against Hitlerism</span>
				<span class='text'>oas, and his students such as [[Melville J</span>
				<span class='text'>Herskovits]] opposed the racist pseudoscience developed at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] under its director [[Eugen Fischer]]: &quot;Melville J</span>
				<span class='text'>Herskovits (one of Franz Boas's students) pointed out that the health problems and social prejudices encountered by these children ([[Rhineland Bastards]]) and their parents explained what Germans viewed as racial inferiority was not due to racial heredity</span>
				<span class='text'>This &quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>ost of Boas's students shared his concern for careful, historical reconstruction, and his antipathy towards speculative, evolutionary models</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Boas encouraged his students, by example, to criticize themselves as much as others</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Boas originally defended the [[cephalic index]] (systematic variations in head form) as a method for describing hereditary traits, but came to reject his earlier research after further study; he similarly came to criticize his own early work in Kwakiutl (Pacific Northwest) language and mythology</span>
				<span class='text'>ncouraged by this drive to self-criticism, as well as the Boasian commitment to learn from one's informants and to let the findings of one's research shape one's agenda, Boas's students quickly diverged from his own research agenda</span>
				<span class='text'>Several of his students soon attempted to develop theories of the grand sort that Boas typically rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>Kroeber called his colleagues' attention to [[Sigmund Freud]] and the potential of a union between cultural anthropology and [[psychoanalysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ruth Benedict]] developed theories of &quot;culture and personality&quot; and &quot;national cultures&quot;, and Kroeber's student, [[Julian Steward]] developed theories of &quot;cultural ecology&quot; and &quot;multilineal evolution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Legacy==Nevertheless, Boas has had an enduring influence on anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>Virtually all anthropologists today accept Boas's commitment to empiricism and his methodological cultural relativism</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, virtually all cultural anthropologists today share Boas's commitment to field research involving extended residence, learning the local language, and developing social relationships with informants</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, anthropologists continue to honor his critique of racial ideologies</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1963 book, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America'', Thomas Gossett wrote that &quot;It is possible that Boas did more to combat race prejudice than any other person in history</span>
