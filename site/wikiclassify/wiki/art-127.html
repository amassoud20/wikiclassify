				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash;  July 8, 1538), also known as '''[[Adelantado|El Adelantado]]''' and '''El Viejo''' (The Elder), was a Spanish [[conquistador]] and a companion and later rival of [[Francisco Pizarro]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He participated in the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] and is credited as the first European discoverer of [[Chile]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lmagro lost his left eye battling with coastal natives in the [[New World]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1525 he joined the [[Pizarro brothers]] and [[Hernando de Luque|Hernándo de Luque]] at [[Panama]] for the conquest of [[Peru]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early years==Diego de Almagro was born and raised in Almagro, Ciudad Real, Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>=Arrival in America==Diego de Almagro arrived in the [[New World]] on June 30, 1514, under the expedition that [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] had sent under the guidance of Pedrarias Dávila</span>
				<span class='text'>The expedition had landed in the city of [[Darién Province|Santa María la Antigua del Darién]], [[Panama]], where many other future conquistadors had already arrived, among them Francisco Pizarro</span>
				<span class='text'>here are not many details of Almagro's activities during this period, but it is known that he accompanied various sailors who departed from the city of Darien between 1514 and 1515</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro eventually returned and settled in Darien, where he was granted an [[encomienda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He built a house and made a living from agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'>lmagro undertook his first conquest on November 1515, commanding 260 men as he founded [[Acla|Villa del Acla]], named after the Indian place</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to illness he had to leave behind this mission to the licenciate [[Gaspar de Espinosa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>spinosa decided to undertake a new expedition, which departed in December of 1515 with 200 men, including Almagro and Francisco Pizarro, who for the first time was designated as a captain</span>
				<span class='text'>During this expedition, which lasted 14 months, Almagro, Pizarro and Hernando de Luque became close friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lso during this time Almagro established a friendship with [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]], who was in charge of Acla</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro wanted to have a ship built with the remaining materials of the Espinosa expedition, to be finished on the coast of the &quot;Great South Sea,&quot; as the Pacific Ocean was first called by the Spanish</span>
				<span class='text'>Current historians do not believe that Almagro was expected to participate in Balboa's expedition and probably returned to Darien</span>
				<span class='text'>lmagro took part in the various expeditions that took place in the [[Gulf of Panama]], taking part again in Espinosa's parties</span>
				<span class='text'>Espinosa was supported by using Balboa's ships</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro was recorded as a witness on the lists of natives whom Espinosa ordered to be carried</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro remained as an early settler in the newly founded city of Panama</span>
				<span class='text'>For four years he stayed there, working at the management of his properties and those of Pizarro</span>
				<span class='text'>He took Ana Martínez, an indigenous woman, as a common-law wife</span>
				<span class='text'>In this period, his first son, el &quot;Mozo&quot;, was born to them</span>
				<span class='text'>=Conquest of Peru==By 1524 an association of conquest regarding South America was formalized among Almagro, Pizarro and Luque</span>

				<span class='text'> Almagro would remain in Panama to recruit men and gather supplies for the expeditions led by Pizarro</span>

				<span class='text'>om Publishing, ISBN 9781420941142&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}} During Pizarro's continued exploration of Incan territory, he and his men succeeded in defeating the Inca army under Emperor [[Atahualpa]] during the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] in 1532</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro joined Pizarro soon afterward, bringing more men and arms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Leon&gt;Leon, P</span>
				<span class='text'> 1998, The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter, edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, ISBN 9780822321460&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219–222,233}}After Peru fell to the Spanish, both Pizarro and Almagro initially worked together in the founding of new cities to consolidate their dominions</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, Pizarro dispatched Almagro to pursue [[Quizquiz]], fleeing to the Inca Empire's northern city of [[Quito]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their fellow conquistador [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito and witnessed the destruction of the city by Inca general [[Rumiñawi (Inca warrior)|Rumiñawi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Inca warrior had ordered the city to be burned and its gold to be buried at an undisclosed location where the Spanish could never find it</span>
				<span class='text'>The arrival of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] from Guatemala, in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for Almagro and Belalcázar</span>
				<span class='text'>Alvarado's presence, however, did not last long as he left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|223–227}}In an attempt to claim Quito ahead of Belalcázar, in August 1534 Almagro founded a city on the shores of Laguna de Colta (Colta Lake) in the foothills of Chimborazo, some 90 miles south of present-day Quito, and named it &quot;Santiago de Quito</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Four months later would come the foundation of the Peruvian city of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], which Almagro named as &quot;Villa Trujillo de Nueva Castilla&quot; (the Village of Trujillo in New Castille) in honor of Francisco Pizarro's birthplace, Trujillo in Extremadura, Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>These events were the height of the Pizarro-Almagro friendship, which historians describe as one of the last events in which their friendship soon faded and entered a period of turmoil for the control of the Incan capital of Cuzco</span>
				<span class='text'>=Conflict with Pizarro==After splitting the treasure of Inca emperor Atahualpa, both Pizarro and Almagro left towards [[Cusco|Cuzco]] and took the city in 1533</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Almagro's friendship with Pizarro showed signs of deterioration in 1526 when Pizarro, in the name of the rest of the conquistadors, called forth the &quot;Capitulacion de Toledo&quot; law in which [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] of Spain had laid out his authorization for the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest of Peru]] and the awards every conquistador would receive from it</span>
				<span class='text'>Long before, however, each conquistador had promised to equally split the benefits</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro managed to have a larger stake and awards for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, Almagro still obtained an important fortune for his services, and the King awarded him in November 1532 the noble title of &quot;Don&quot; and he was assigned a personal coat of arms</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough by this time Diego de Almagro had already acquired sufficient wealth in the conquest of Peru and was living a luxurious life in Cuzco, the prospect of conquering the lands further south was very attractive to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Given that the dispute with Pizarro over Cuzco had kept intensifying, Almagro spent a great deal of time and money equipping a company of 500 men for a new exploration south of Peru</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1534 the Spanish crown had determined to split the region in two parallel lines, forming the governorship of &quot;Nueva Castilla&quot; (from the 1° to the 14° latitude, close to [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]), and that of &quot;Nueva Toledo&quot; (from the 14° to the 25° latitude, in [[Taltal]], Chile), assigning the first to Francisco Pizarro and the second to Diego de Almagro</span>
				<span class='text'>The crown had previously assigned Almagro the governorship of Cuzco, and as such Almagro was heading there when Charles V divided the territory between Nueva Castilla and Nueva Toledo</span>
				<span class='text'>This might have been the reason why Almagro did not immediately confront Pizarro for Cuzco, and promptly decided to embark on his new quest for the discovery of the riches of Chile</span>
				<span class='text'>=Discovery of Chile=={{Main|Discovery of Chile}}===The preparations===[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] had given Diego a grant extending two hundred [[league (unit)|leagues]] south of Francisco Pizarro's</span>
				<span class='text'>Francisco and Diego concluded a new contract on 12 June 1535, in which they agreed to share future discoveries equally</span>
				<span class='text'>Diego raised an expedition for Chile, expecting it &quot;would lead to even greater riches than they had found in Peru</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|230,233–234}} Almagro prepared the way by sending ahead three of his Spanish soldiers, the religious chief of the Inca empire, ''[[Willaq Umu]],'' and Paullo Topa, brother of ''[[Manco Inca Yupanqui]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' Almagro sent [[Juan de Saavedra]] forward with one hundred and fifty men, and soon followed them with additional forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|230,233–234}}===Following the Inca Trail and crossing the Andes===Almagro left Cuzco on July 3, 1535 with his supporters and stopped at [[Moina]] until the 20th of that month</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Francisco Pizarro's brother, Juan Pizarro, had arrested Inca [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], further complicating Almagro's plans as it heavily increased the dissatisfaction of the Indians submitted to Spanish rule</span>
				<span class='text'>Not having formally been appointed governor of any territories in the [[Capitulation of Toledo]] in 1528, however, forcing him to declare himself ''adelantado'' (governor) of Nueva Toledo, or southern Peru and present-day Chile</span>
				<span class='text'>Some sources suggest Almagro received such a requirement in 1534 by the Spanish king and was officially declared governor of New Toledo</span>
				<span class='text'>nce he left Moina, Almagro followed the [[Inca trail]] followed by 750 Spaniards deciding to join him in quest for the gold lost in the [[Ransom Room|ransom of Atahualpa]], which had mainly benefited the Pizarro brothers and their supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>After crossing the Bolivian mountain range and traveling past [[Lake Titicaca]], Almagro arrived on the shores of the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]] and finally set up camp in [[Tupiza]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From there, the expedition stopped at [[Chicoana]] and then turned to the southeast to cross the [[Andes]] mountains</span>
				<span class='text'>he expedition turned out to be a difficult and exhausting endeavor</span>
				<span class='text'>The hardest phase was the crossing of the Andes cordillera: the cold, hunger and tiredness meant the death of various Spaniards and natives, but mainly slaves who were not accustomed to such rigorous climate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|252–253}}[[Image:Alamagro Chile</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Almagro takes possession of Chile in the valley of Copiapo</span>
				<span class='text'>]Upon this point, Almagro determined everything was a failure</span>
				<span class='text'>He ordered a small group under [[Rodrigo Orgonez]] on a [[reconnaissance]] of the country to the south</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|253}}By luck, these men found the Valley of [[Copiapó]], where Gonzalo Calvo Barrientos, a Spaniard whom Pizarro had expelled from Peru for stealing objects the Inca had offered for his ransom, had already established a friendship with the local natives</span>
				<span class='text'>There, in the valley of the river Copiapó, Almagro took official possession of Chile and  claimed it in the name of King Charles V</span>
				<span class='text'>=Dismayed in Chile==Almagro promptly initiated the exploration of the new territory, starting up the valley the [[Aconcagua River]], where he was well received by the natives</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the intrigues of his interpreter, [[Felipillo]], who had previously helped Pizarro in dealing with ''[[Atahualpa]]'', almost thwarted Almagro's efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>Felipillo had secretly urged the local natives to attack the Spanish, but they desisted, not understanding the dangers that they posed</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro directed Gómez de Alvarado along with 100 horsemen and 100 foot to continue the exploration, which ended in the confluence of the Ñuble and Itata rivers</span>
				<span class='text'>The Battle of [[Reynogüelén|Reinohuelén]] between the Spanish and hostile [[Mapuche]] Indians forced the explorers to return to the north</span>
				<span class='text'>lmagro's own reconnaissance of the land and the bad news of Gómez de Alvarado's encounter with the fierce Mapuche, along with the bitter cold winter that settled ferociously upon them, only served to confirm that everything had failed</span>
				<span class='text'>He never found gold or the cities which Incan scouts had told him lay ahead, only communities of the indigenous population who lived from subsistence agriculture</span>
				<span class='text'>Local tribes put up fierce resistance to the Spanish forces</span>
				<span class='text'>The exploration of the territories of Nueva Toledo, which lasted 2 years, was marked by a complete failure for Almagro</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, at first he thought staying and founding a city would serve well for his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>The initial optimism that led Almagro to bring his son he had with the indigenous Panamanian Ana Martínez to Chile had faded</span>
				<span class='text'>ome historians have suggested that, but for the urging of his senior explorers, Almagro would probably have stayed permanently in Chile</span>
				<span class='text'>He was urged to return to Peru and this time take definitive possession of [[Cuzco]], so as to consolidate an inheritance for his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Dismayed with his experience in the south, Almagro made plans of return to Peru</span>
				<span class='text'>He never officially founded a city in the territory of what is now Chile</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|254}}The withdrawal of the Spanish from valleys of Chile was violent: Almagro authorized his soldiers to ransack the natives' properties, leaving their soil desolate</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the Spanish soldiers took natives captive to serve as slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>The locals were captured, tied together, and forced to carry the heavy loads belonging to the conquistadors</span>
				<span class='text'>=Return to Peru==After the exhausting crossing of the [[Atacama Desert]], mainly due to the weather conditions, Almagro finally reached Cuzco, Peru, in 1537</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|254}} According to some authors, it was during this time that the Spanish term ''&quot;[[roto]]&quot;'' (torn), used by Peruvians to refer to Chileans, was first coined</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro's disappointed troops returned to Cuzco with their &quot;torn clothes&quot; due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot by the Atacama Desert</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Diego-de-Almagro</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Capture and execution of Diego de Almagro (Engraving, circa 1600)</span>
				<span class='text'>]After his return, Almagro was surprised to learn of the Inca [[Manco Inca Yupanqui|Manco]]'s rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro sent an embassy to the Inca, but they mistrusted all of the Spaniards by this time</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hernando Pizarro]]'s men formed an uneasy truce with Almagro's men, surveying to determine the boundaries of their leaders' royal grants</span>
				<span class='text'>They needed to determine in which portion the city of Cuzco was located</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Almagro's troops quickly took the city and imprisoned the [[Pizarro brothers]], Hernando and Gonzalo, on the night of 8 April 1537</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|254–256}}After occupying Cuzco, Almagro confronted an army sent by Francisco Pizarro to liberate his brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Alonso de Alvarado]] commanded it and was defeated during the [[Battle of Abancay]] on July 12, 1537</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|257}} He and some of his men were imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, Gonzalo Pizarro and Alvarado escaped prison</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent negotiations between Francisco Pizarro and Almagro concluded with the liberation of Hernando, the third Pizarro brother, in return for conceding control and administration of Cuzco to Almagro</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro never intended to give up the city permanently, but was buying time to organize an army strong enough to defeat Almagro's troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|260–262}}During this time Almagro fell ill, and Pizarro and his brothers grabbed the opportunity to defeat him and his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>The Almagristas were defeated at [[Battle of Las Salinas|Las Salinas]] in April 1538, with Orgóñez being killed on the field of battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Almagro fled to Cuzco, still in the hands of his loyal supporters, but found only temporary refuge; the forces of the Pizarro brothers entered the city without resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>Once captured, Almagro was humiliated by Hernando Pizarro and his requests to appeal to the King were ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>s Almagro begged for his life, Hernando responded:&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|262–268}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;-he was surprised to see Almagro demean himself in a manner so unbecoming a brave cavalier, that his fate was no worse than had befallen many a soldier before him; and that, since God had given him the grace to be a Christian, he should employ his remaining moments in making up his account with Heaven!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Almagro was condemned to death and executed by ''garrote'' in his dungeon, and then decapitated, on July 8, 1538</span>
				<span class='text'>His corpse was taken to the public Plaza Mayor of Cuzco, where a herald proclaimed his crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>Hernan Ponce de Leon took his body and buried him in the church of Our Lady of Mercy in Cuzco</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|269}}==El Mozo==[[Diego de Almagro II]] (1520–1542), known as ''El Mozo'' (The Lad), son of Diego de Almagro I, whose mother was an Indian girl of [[Panama City, Panama|Panama]], became the foil of the conspirators who had put [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] to the sword</span>
				<span class='text'>Pizarro was murdered on June 26, 1541; the conspirators promptly proclaimed the lad Almagro Governor of Peru</span>
				<span class='text'>From various causes, all of the conspirators either died or were killed except for one, who was executed after the lad Almagro gave an order</span>
				<span class='text'> The lad Almagro fought the desperate [[battle of Chupas]] on September 16, 1542, escaped to [[Cusco|Cuzco]], but was arrested, immediately condemned to death, and executed in the great square of the city</span>
