				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was the [[King in Prussia]] and [[Elector of Brandenburg]] from 1713 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He was in [[personal union]] the sovereign prince of the [[Principality of Neuchâtel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Reign==He was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had successfully acquired the title King for the [[margrave]]s of [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his own reign, Frederick William I did much to centralize and improve Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>He replaced mandatory military service among the middle class with an annual tax, established schools, and resettled [[East Prussia]] (which had been devastated by the [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] in 1709)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>xulanten</span>
				<span class='text'>om/preussen</span>
				<span class='text'>tml Ostpreußen: The Great Trek]&lt;/ref&gt;The king encouraged farming, reclaimed marshes, stored grain in good times and sold it in bad times</span>
				<span class='text'>He dictated the manual of Regulations for State Officials, containing 35 chapters and 297 paragraphs in which every public servant in Prussia could find his duties precisely set out:  a minister or councillor failing to attend a committee meeting, for example, would lose six months' pay; if he absented himself a second time, he would be discharged from the royal service</span>
				<span class='text'>n short, Frederick William I concerned himself with every aspect of his relatively small country, planning to satisfy all that was needed for Prussia to defend itself</span>
				<span class='text'> His rule was absolutist and he was a firm autocrat</span>
				<span class='text'> He practiced rigid, frugal economy, never started a war, and led a simple and austre lifestyle</span>
				<span class='text'> At his death, there was a large surplus in the royal treasury (which was kept in the cellar of the royal palace)</span>
				<span class='text'> He intervened briefly in the [[Great Northern War]] in order to gain a portion of Swedish Pomerania</span>
				<span class='text'> More significantly, the &quot;Soldier-King&quot; had made considerable reforms to the Prussian army's training, tactics and conscription program—introducing the [[Canton System (Prussia)|canton system]] and leaving his son Frederick with a formidable weapon with which to build Prussia's power</span>
				<span class='text'> The observation that &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword&quot; has sometimes been attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>(''See as well:'' “[[Prussian virtues]]”</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a highly effective ruler, Frederick William had a violent temper; this was exacerbated by his inherited porphyritic illness, which gave him gout, obesity and frequent stomach pains</span>
				<span class='text'>=Burial and reburials==Frederick William died in 1740 at age 51 and was interred at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]]</span>
				<span class='text'> During World War II, in order to protect it from advancing allied forces, Hitler ordered the king’s coffin, as well as those of [[Frederick the Great]] and [[Paul von Hindenburg]], into hiding, first to Berlin and later to a salt mine outside of [[Bernterode_(bei_Worbis)|Bernterode]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The coffins were later discovered by occupying American Forces, who re-interred the bodies in [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Elisabeth's Church]] in [[Marburg]] in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1953 the coffin was moved to [[Hohenzollern Castle|Burg Hohenzollern]], where it remained until 1991, when it was finally laid to rest on the steps of the altar in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum in the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Church of Peace]] on the palace grounds of [[Sanssouci]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The original black marble sarcophagus collapsed at Burg Hohenzollern—the current one is a copper copy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Relationship with Frederick II==[[File:Die Söhne von Friedrich Wilhelm I</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The sons of Frederick William I and Sophia Dorothea; painting by [[Francesco Carlo Rusca]], 1737]]His eldest surviving son was [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] (Fritz), born in 1712</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick William wanted him to become a fine soldier</span>
				<span class='text'>As a small child, Fritz was awakened each morning by the firing of a cannon</span>
				<span class='text'> At the age of 6, he was given his own regiment of children &lt;ref&gt; Mitford, Nancy (1970)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Frederick the Great&quot; pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1 &lt;/ref&gt; to drill as cadets, and a year later, he was given a miniature arsenal</span>
				<span class='text'> The love and affection Frederick William had for his heir initially was soon destroyed due to their increasingly different personalities</span>
				<span class='text'> Frederick William ordered Fritz to undergo a minimal education, live a simple Protestant lifestyle, and focus on the Army and statesmanship as he had</span>
				<span class='text'> However, the intellectual Fritz was more interested in music, books and French culture, which were forbidden by his father as decadent and unmanly</span>
				<span class='text'> As Fritz's defiance for his father's rules increased, Frederick William would frequently beat or humiliate Fritz (he preferred his younger sibling August William)</span>
				<span class='text'>Fritz was beaten for being thrown off a bolting horse and wearing gloves in cold weather</span>
				<span class='text'>After the prince attempted to flee to England with his tutor, [[Hans Hermann von Katte]], the enraged King had Katte executed before the eyes of the prince, who himself was court-martialled</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The court declared itself not competent in this case</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether it was the king's intention to have his son executed as well (as [[Voltaire]] claims) is not clear</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] intervened, claiming that a prince could only be tried by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Frederick was imprisoned in the Fortress of [[Kostrzyn nad Odrą|Küstrin]] from 2 September to 19 November 1731 and exiled from court until February 1732, during which time he was rigorously schooled in matters of state</span>
				<span class='text'> After achieving a measure of reconciliation, Frederick William had his son married to Princess Elizabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, whom Frederick despised, but then allowed him to indulge in his musical and literary interests again</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough the relationship between Frederick William and Frederick was clearly hostile, Frederick himself later wrote that his father &quot;penetrated and understood great objectives, and knew the best interests of his country better than any minister or general</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;==Marriage and family==Frederick William married his first cousin [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s younger sister (daughter of his uncle, King [[George I of Great Britain]] and [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]]) on 28 November 1706</span>
				<span class='text'> Frederick William was faithful and loving to his wife &lt;ref&gt; Mitford, Nancy (1970)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Frederick the Great&quot; p</span>
				<span class='text'> &lt;/ref&gt; but they did not have a happy relationship: Sophia Dorothea feared his unpredictable temper and resented him, both for allowing her no influence at court and for refusing to marry her children to their English cousins</span>
				<span class='text'> She also abhorred his cruelty towards their son and heir Frederick (with whom she was close), although rather than trying to mend the relationship between father and son she frequently spurred Frederick on in his defiance</span>
				<span class='text'> They had fourteen children, including:{| class=&quot;toccolours collapsible collapsed&quot; width=100% align=&quot;center&quot;|-! style=&quot;background:#ccccff;&quot;|Issue|-|{| style=&quot;text-align:center; width:100%&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;! width=20% | Name !! width=60px | Portrait !!
