				<span class='text'>==Later life and death===Beginning in 1970, Heinlein had a series of health crises, broken by strenuous periods of activity in his hobby of [[stonemasonry]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;On Paul Dirac and antimatter, and on blood chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'> A version of the former, titled ''Paul Dirac, Antimatter, and You'', was published in the anthology ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'', and it demonstrates both Heinlein's skill as a popularizer and his lack of depth in physics</span>

				<span class='text'> While vacationing in Tahiti in early 1978, he suffered a [[transient ischemic attack]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Over the next few months, he became more and more exhausted, and his health again began to decline</span>

				<span class='text'> Members included [[Buzz Aldrin]], General Daniel Graham, rocket engineer Max Hunter, North American VP and Space Shuttle manager George Merrick, and other aerospace industry leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Policy recommendations from the Council included ballistic missile defense concepts which were later transformed into what was called the Strategic Defense Initiative by those who favored it, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; as a term of derision coined by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>t that time, he had been putting together the early notes for another ''[[World as Myth]]'' novel</span>
				<span class='text'> Several of his other works have been published posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Based on an outline and notes created by Heinlein in 1955, [[Spider Robinson]] has written the novel ''[[Variable Star]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> Heinlein's posthumously published nonfiction includes a selection of letters edited by his wife, Virginia, ''[[Grumbles from the Grave]]''; his book on practical politics written in 1946 published as ''[[Take Back Your Government]]''; and a travelogue of their first around-the-world tour in 1954, ''[[Tramp Royale]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> The novels ''Podkayne of Mars'' and ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'', which were edited against his wishes in their original release, have been reissued in restored editions</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Stranger In a Strange Land'' was originally published in a shorter form, but both the long and short versions are now simultaneously available in print</span>

				<span class='text'>His juvenile stories often had a maturity to them that made them readable for adults</span>
				<span class='text'>''Red Planet'', for example, portrays some very subversive themes, including a revolution in which young students are involved; his editor demanded substantial changes in this book's discussion of topics such as the use of weapons by children and the misidentified sex of the Martian character</span>

				<span class='text'>==Sexual issues===For Heinlein, personal liberation included [[sexual liberation]], and [[free love]] was a major subject of his writing starting in 1939, with ''For Us, The Living''</span>
				<span class='text'>During his early period, Heinlein's writing for younger readers needed to take account of both editorial perceptions of sexuality in his novels, and potential perceptions among the buying public; as critic William H</span>
				<span class='text'>Patterson has put it, his dilemma was &quot;to sort out what was really objectionable from what was only excessive over-sensitivity to imaginary librarians&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By his middle period, sexual freedom and the elimination of sexual jealousy were a major theme of ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' (1961), in which the progressively minded but sexually conservative reporter, Ben Caxton, acts as a [[foil (literature)|dramatic foil]] for the less parochial characters, [[Jubal Harshaw]] and Valentine Michael Smith (Mike)</span>

				<span class='text'>It is disconcerting, for example, that in ''Expanded Universe'' Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Heinlein's ''Stranger in a Strange Land'', Jill, one of the main characters, says, &quot;nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped it's partly her fault&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian</span>
				<span class='text'>om&quot;/&gt;In books written as early as 1956, Heinlein dealt with incest and the sexual nature of children</span>
				<span class='text'> Many of his books (including ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', ''[[Glory Road]]'', ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', and ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'') dealt explicitly or implicitly with incest, sexual feelings and relations between adults and children, or both</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |title=The Heinlein Society |publisher=The Heinlein Society |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of these themes include the romantic relationship and eventual marriage (once the girl becomes an adult via time-travel) of a 30-year-old engineer and an 11-year-old girl in ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' or the more overt intra-familial incest in ''To Sail Beyond the Sunset'' and ''Farnham's Freehold''</span>
				<span class='text'> Peers such as [[L</span>
				<span class='text'>Sprague de Camp]] and [[Damon Knight]] have commented critically on Heinlein's portrayal of incest and pedophilia in a lighthearted and even approving manner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;The Heinlein Society&quot;/&gt;===Philosophy===In ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', Heinlein has the main character, [[Maureen Johnson (Heinlein character)|Maureen]], state that the purpose of [[metaphysics]] is to ask questions:  Why are we here?  Where are we going after we die? (and so on), and that you are not allowed to answer the questions</span>
				<span class='text'>''Asking'' the questions is the point of metaphysics, but ''answering'' them is not, because once you answer this kind of question, you cross the line into religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Maureen does not state a reason for this; she simply remarks that such questions are &quot;beautiful&quot; but lack answers</span>
				<span class='text'>Maureen's son/lover Lazarus Long makes a related remark in ''Time Enough for Love''</span>
				<span class='text'>In order for us to answer the &quot;big questions&quot; about the universe, Lazarus states at one point, it would be necessary to stand ''outside'' the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the 1930s and 1940s, Heinlein was deeply interested in [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[General Semantics]] and attended a number of seminars on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>His views on [[epistemology]] seem to have flowed from that interest, and his fictional characters continue to express Korzybskian views to the very end of his writing career</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his stories, such as ''[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]'', ''[[If This Goes On—]]'', and ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', depend strongly on the premise, related to the well-known  [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], that by using a correctly [[constructed language|designed language]], one can change or improve oneself mentally, or even realize untapped potential (as in the case of Joe Green in ''Gulf'')</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}When [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' was published, Heinlein was very favorably impressed, as quoted in &quot;Grumbles</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; and mentioned John Galt—the hero in Rand's ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''—as a heroic archetype in ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress''</span>
				<span class='text'> He was also strongly affected by the religious philosopher [[P</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;aolbio&quot;/&gt; [[Sigmund Freud|Freudianism]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were at the height of their influence during the peak of Heinlein's career, and stories such as ''[[Time for the Stars]]''  indulged in psychological theorizing</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, he was skeptical about Freudianism, especially after a struggle with an editor who insisted on reading Freudian sexual symbolism into his [[Young-adult fiction|juvenile novels]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Heinlein was fascinated by the [[social credit]] movement in the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>This is shown in ''[[Beyond This Horizon]]'' and in his 1938 novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'', which was finally published in 2003, long after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He was strongly committed to [[cultural relativism]], and the sociologist Margaret Mader in his novel ''[[Citizen of the Galaxy]]'' is clearly a reference to [[Margaret Mead]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Pay it Forward====The term &quot;pay it forward&quot;, though it was already in occasional use as a quotation, was popularized by Robert A</span>
				<span class='text'>Heinlein in his book ''[[Between Planets]]'', published in 1951:{{quotation|The banker reached into the folds of his gown, pulled out a single credit note</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&quot;Instead, pay it forward to some other brother who needs it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;}}Heinlein was a mentor to [[Ray Bradbury]], giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him</span>
				<span class='text'>In Bradbury's novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>Jonas, he wondered, for what he's done?  How do I thank him, how pay him back? No way, no way at all</span>
				<span class='text'>You just can't pay</span>
				<span class='text'>What then? What? Pass it on somehow, he thought, pass it on to someone else</span>
				<span class='text'>Keep the chain moving</span>
				<span class='text'>Look around, find someone, and pass it on</span>
				<span class='text'>That was the only way</span>

				<span class='text'> Most of his works, including short stories, have been continuously in print in many languages since their initial appearance and are still available as new paperbacks decades after his death</span>

				<span class='text'>]He was at the top of his form during, and himself helped to initiate, the trend toward [[social science fiction]], which went along with a general maturing of the genre away from [[space opera]] to a more literary approach touching on such adult issues as politics and [[human sexuality]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In reaction to this trend, [[hard science fiction]] began to be distinguished as a separate subgenre, but paradoxically Heinlein is also considered a seminal figure in hard science fiction, due to his extensive knowledge of engineering, and the careful scientific research demonstrated in his stories</span>
				<span class='text'> Heinlein himself stated—with obvious pride—that in the days before pocket calculators, he and his wife Virginia once worked for several days on a mathematical equation describing an Earth-Mars rocket orbit, which was then subsumed in a single sentence of the novel ''Space Cadet''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Influence among writers===Heinlein has had a nearly ubiquitous influence on other science fiction writers</span>
				<span class='text'> In a 1953 poll of leading science fiction authors, he was cited more frequently as an influence than any other modern writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Panshin, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3, describing de Camp's Science Fiction Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; Critic James Gifford writes that &quot;Although many other writers have exceeded Heinlein's output, few can claim to match his broad and seminal influence</span>

				<span class='text'> [[TANSTAAFL]], short for There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch, an existing term that refers to the fact that things supposedly given free always have some real cost, popularized in ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Moonbat]]&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times Magazine]], ''On Language'', by [[William Safire]], September 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; used in [[United States politics]] as a pejorative political [[epithet]] referring to progressives or [[leftists]], was originally the name of a space ship in his story ''[[Space Jockey]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Grok]], a &quot;Martian&quot; word for understanding a thing so fully as to become one with it, from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Space Marine]], an existing term popularized by Heinlein in short stories, the concept then being made famous by ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', though the term &quot;space marine&quot; is not used in that novel</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Speculative fiction]], a term Heinlein used for the separation of serious, consistent Science Fiction writing, from the pop &quot;sci fi&quot; of the day, which generally took great artistic license with human knowledge, amounting to being more like space fantasy than ''science'' fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>==Inspiring culture and technology===In 1962, [[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] (then still using his birth name, Tim Zell) founded the [[Church of All Worlds]], a [[Neopagan]] religious organization modeled in many ways after the treatment of religion in the novel ''Stranger in a Strange Land''</span>
				<span class='text'> This spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as &quot;grok&quot;, &quot;Thou art God&quot;, and &quot;Never Thirst&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, there was a frequent exchange of correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and he was a paid subscriber to their magazine, ''[[Green Egg]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> This Church still exists as a 501(C)(3) religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today</span>
