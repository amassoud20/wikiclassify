				<span class='text'> that he was alive when [[Totila]] attempted to murder Carbonius, Bishop of [[Populonia]], probably in 546</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter of 598 (''Register'', Book 9, Letter 1) he rebukes Bishop Januarius of [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]], excusing himself for not observing 1 Timothy 5</span>
				<span class='text'>, which cautions against rebuking elders</span>
				<span class='text'>Timothy 5</span>
				<span class='text'> defines elderly women to be 60 and over, which would probably apply to all</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory appears not to consider himself an elder, limiting his birth to no earlier than 539, but 540 is the typical selection</span>
				<span class='text'>Dudden (1905), page 3, notes 1–3</span>
				<span class='text'>The presumption of 540 has continued in modern times - see for example Richards, Jeffrey (1980)</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>vigilator, seu vigilans sonat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, Paul the deacon is too late for the first ''vita'', or life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; did not hesitate to apply it to the life of Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>Aelfric states, &quot;He was very diligent in God's Commandments</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;The name is Biblical, derived from [[New Testament]] contexts: grēgorein is a present, continuous aspect, meaning to be watchful of forsaking Christ</span>

				<span class='text'>His father, Gordianus, who served as a Senator and for a time was the Prefect of the City of Rome,&lt;ref name=Thornton&gt;Thornton, pp 163-8&lt;/ref&gt; also held the position of [[Regionarius]] in the church, though nothing further is known about that position</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's mother, Silvia, was well-born, and had a married sister, Pateria, in [[Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother and two paternal aunts are honored by Catholic and Orthodox churches as saints</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's election to the throne of St Peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richards&lt;/ref&gt;The family owned and resided in a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' on the [[Caelian Hill]], fronting the same street (now the Via di San Gregorio) as the former palaces of the Roman emperors on the [[Palatine Hill]] opposite</span>
				<span class='text'>The north of the street runs into the [[Colosseum]]; the south, the [[Circus Maximus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 11–15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Villas covered the area</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's family also owned working estates in [[Sicily]]&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 106–107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and around Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richards (1980), page 25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by [[John, deacon of Rome|John the Deacon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>He wore a beard</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Saint Silvia|Silvia]] was tall, had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful look</span>
				<span class='text'>They had another son whose name and fate are unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 7–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gregory was born into a period of upheaval in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>From 542 the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]] swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting</span>
				<span class='text'>In some parts of the country, over 1/3 of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Markus pg 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, although the [[Western Roman Empire]] had long since vanished in favour of the Gothic kings of Italy, during the 540s [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] was gradually retaken from the [[Goths]] by [[Justinian I]], emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] ruling from [[Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As the fighting was mainly in the north, the young Gregory probably saw little of it</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Totila]] [[Sack of Rome (546)|sacked and vacated Rome]] in 546, destroying most of its ancient population, but in 549 he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been hypothesized that young Gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their Sicilian estates, to return in 549</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 36–37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gothic War (535–554)|war]] was over in Rome by 552, and a subsequent invasion of the [[Franks]] was defeated in 554</span>
				<span class='text'>After that, there was peace in Italy, and the appearance of restoration, except that the central government now resided in Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>ike most young men of his position in Roman society, Saint Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law, and excelling in all</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Thornton /&gt; [[Gregory of Tours]] reported that &quot;in grammar, dialectic and rhetoric </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he was second to none</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref name=rich26&gt;Richards (1980), page 26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He wrote correct Latin but did not read or write Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>He knew Latin authors, natural science, history, mathematics and music and had such a &quot;fluency with imperial law&quot; that he may have trained in it &quot;as a preparation for a career in public life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=rich26/&gt; Indeed, he became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only thirty-three years old</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Thornton /&gt;The monks of the Monastery of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Andrew, established by Gregory at the ancestral home on the Caelian, had a portrait of him made after his death, which John the Deacon also saw in the 9th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He reports the picture of a man who was &quot;rather bald&quot; and had a &quot;tawny&quot; beard like his father's and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mother's and father's</span>
				<span class='text'>The hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled</span>
				<span class='text'>His nose was &quot;thin and straight&quot; and &quot;slightly aquiline</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &quot;His forehead was high</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He had thick, &quot;subdivided&quot; lips and a chin &quot;of a comely prominence&quot; and &quot;beautiful hands</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1980), page 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the modern era, Gregory is often depicted as a man at the border, poised between the Roman and Germanic worlds, between East and West, and above all, perhaps, between the ancient and medieval epochs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Leyser pg 132&lt;/ref&gt;==Monastic years==[[File:Jerome and Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Jerome]] and Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>]On his father's death, Gregory converted his family ''villa'' into a [[monastery]] dedicated to the [[Twelve apostles|apostle]] [[Saint Andrew]] (after his death it was rededicated as [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In his life of contemplation, Gregory concluded that &quot;in that silence of the heart, while we keep watch within through contemplation, we are as if asleep to all things that are without</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cavadini pg 155&lt;/ref&gt;It seems to some that Gregory was not always forgiving, or pleasant for that matter, even in his monastic years</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone, then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse, &quot;Take your money with you to perdition&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin, even on one's deathbed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Straw pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was done to help the monk to repent of his sin, and not out of a misplaced anger</span>
				<span class='text'>The penance from St Gregory did in fact help him to repent, and afterwards St Gregory offered 30 Masses in his remembrance to [[Prayer for the dead|assist his soul]] before the [[final judgment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The monk later appeared to his brother and said that he has been released and is in Heaven</span>

				<span class='text'>However, Italy was not healed until well after Gregory was gone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gregory the great and his world pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;Gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life</span>
				<span class='text'>He viewed being a monk as the 'ardent quest for the vision of our Creator</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Markus- pg 69&lt;/ref&gt; His three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity</span>
				<span class='text'>However, after the two eldest died after seeing a vision of their ancestor Pope Felix, the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate</span>

				<span class='text'>Municipale, MS 2, [[Dijon]])</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 579, Pelagius II chose Gregory as his ''[[apocrisiarius]]'' (ambassador to the imperial court in [[Constantinople]]), a post Gregory would hold until 586</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was part of the Roman delegation (both lay and clerical) that arrived in Constantinople in 578 to ask the emperor for military aid against the [[Lombards]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e9&quot;&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With the Byzantine military [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591|focused on the East]], these entreaties proved unsuccessful; in 584, Pelagius II wrote to Gregory as ''apocrisiarius'', detailing the hardships that Rome was experiencing under the Lombards and asking him to ask [[Emperor Maurice]] to send a relief force</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e9&quot;/&gt; Maurice, however, had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the Lombards to intrigue and diplomacy, pitting the [[Franks]] against them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e9&quot;/&gt; It soon became obvious to Gregory that the Byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force, given their more immediate difficulties with the Persians in the East and the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] to the North</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e10&quot;&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Ekonomou, &quot;if Gregory's principal task was to plead Rome's cause before the emperor, there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward Italy became evident</span>
				<span class='text'>Papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e10&quot;/&gt; Gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of [[John III Scholasticus]], who had occupied the Patriarchate of Constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople|Eutychius]] (who had been driven out by Justinian)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e10&quot;/&gt; Gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the Byzantine elite of the city, where he became extremely popular with the city's upper class, &quot;especially aristocratic women&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e10&quot;/&gt; Ekonomou surmises that &quot;while Gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of Constantinople's aristocracy, this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of Rome before the emperor&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e10&quot;/&gt; Although the writings of John the Deacon claim that Gregory &quot;labored diligently for the relief of Italy&quot;, there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of Pelagius II</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>10–11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gregory's theological disputes with Patriarch Eutychius would leave a &quot;bitter taste for the theological speculation of the East&quot; with Gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e11&quot;&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Western sources, Gregory's very public debate with Eutychius culminated in an exchange before [[Tiberius II]] where Gregory cited a biblical passage (&quot;''Palpate et videte, quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet, sicut me videtis habere''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ewadvent</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/bible/luk024</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Luke 24:39] - &quot;touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;) in support of the view that Christ was corporeal and palpable after his Resurrection; allegedly as a result of this exchange, Tiberius II ordered Eutychius's writings burned</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e11&quot;/&gt; Ekonomou views this argument, though exaggerated in Western sources, as Gregory's &quot;one achievement of an otherwise fruitless ''apokrisiariat''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e12&quot;&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gregory was forced to rely on Scripture because he could not read the untranslated Greek authoritative works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;e12&quot;/&gt; Gregory left Constantinople for Rome in 585, returning to his monastery on the [[Caelian Hill]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Straw pg 25&lt;/ref&gt; In texts of all genres, especially those produced in his first year as pope, Gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life ofprayer he had once enjoyed as a monk</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cavadini pg 39&lt;/ref&gt;When he became Pope in 590, among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of Peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, for various reasons, the [[Holy See]] had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of [[Pope Gelasius I|Gelasius I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The episcopacy in [[Gaul]] was drawn from the great territorial families, and identified with them: the parochial horizon of Gregory's contemporary, [[Gregory of Tours]], may be considered typical; in [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain the [[bishop]]s had little contact with Rome; in [[Italy]] the territories which had ''de facto'' fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent [[Lombards|Lombard]] dukes and the rivalry of the Byzantines in the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and in the south</span>
				<span class='text'>ope Gregory had strong convictions on missions: &quot;Almighty God places good men in authority that He may impart through them the gifts of His mercy to their subjects</span>

				<span class='text'>It seems that the Pope had never forgotten the English slaves whom he had once seen in the Roman Forum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dudden pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was successful, and it was from England that missionaries later set out for the Netherlands and Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>The preaching of the Catholic faith and theelimination of all deviations from it was a key element in Gregory's worldview, and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate</span>

				<span class='text'>In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of [[accounting]], which was not to be invented for centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>The church already had basic accounting documents: every [[expense]] was recorded in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|journals]] called ''regesta'', &quot;lists&quot; of amounts, recipients and circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>Revenue was recorded in ''polyptici'', &quot;[[Bookkeeping|books]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these polyptici were [[ledger]]s recording the operating expenses of the church and the [[asset]]s, the ''patrimonia''</span>
				<span class='text'>A central papal administration, the ''notarii'', under a chief, the ''primicerius notariorum'', kept the ledgers and issued ''brevia patrimonii'', or lists of property for which each ''[[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]'' was responsible</span>

				<span class='text'>In a letter to a subordinate in [[Sicily]] he wrote: &quot;I asked you most of all to take care of the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out </span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrosini &amp; Willis (1996) pages 66–67</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind</span>
				<span class='text'>He understood that expenses must be matched by [[income]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici</span>
				<span class='text'>The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Money, however, was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas</span>
				<span class='text'>The church now owned between {{convert|1300|and|1800|sqmi|km2}} of revenue-generating farmland divided into large sections called ''patrimonia</span>
				<span class='text'>' It produced goods of all kinds, which were sold, but Gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to Rome for distribution in the ''diaconia''</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave orders to step up production, set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out</span>
				<span class='text'>At the bottom was the ''rusticus'' who produced the goods</span>
				<span class='text'>Some rustici were or owned slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned over part of his produce to a ''conductor'' from whom he leased the land</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter reported to an ''actionarius'', the latter to a ''defensor'' and the latter to a ''rector''</span>
				<span class='text'>Grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish and oil began to arrive at Rome in large quantities, where it was given away for nothing as alms</span>

				<span class='text'>However, a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply</span>
				<span class='text'>To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed</span>
				<span class='text'>When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests</span>
				<span class='text'>To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity</span>
