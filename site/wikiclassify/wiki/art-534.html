				<span class='text'>As described in [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]], &quot;In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb's hand or pat him on the shoulder</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back&quot;/&gt; The &quot;overly familiar greeting infuriated&quot; Cobb, who attacked Cummings</span>
				<span class='text'>When Cummings' wife tried to defend him, Cobb allegedly choked her</span>
				<span class='text'>The assault was only stopped when catcher [[Boss Schmidt|Charles &quot;Boss&quot; Schmidt]] knocked Cobb out</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''When Cobb Met Wagner: The Seven-Game World Series of 1909'' by David Finoli, McFarland, 2010, page 230</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, aside from Schmidt's statement to the press, no other corroborating witnesses to the assault on Cummings ever came forward and Cummings himself never made a public comment about it</span>
				<span class='text'>Author Charles Leerhsen speculates that the assault on Cummings and his wife never occurred and that Schmidt likely made it up completely</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb had spent the previous year defending himself on several occasions from assaults by Schmidt, with Schmidt often coming out of nowhere to blindside Cobb</span>
				<span class='text'>On that day, several reporters did see Cummings, who appeared to be &quot;partially under the influence of liquor&quot;, approach Cobb and shout &quot;Hello, Carrie!&quot; (the meaning of which is unknown) and go in for a hug</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb then pushed him away, which was the last interaction that anyone saw between Cobb and Cummings</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, hearing a fight, several reporters came running and found Cobb and Schmidt wrestling on the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>When the fight was broken up and Cobb had walked away, Schmidt remained behind and told the reporters that he saw Cobb assaulting Cummings and his wife and had intervened</span>
				<span class='text'>Leerhsen speculates that this was just another one of Schmidt's assaults on Cobb and that once discovered, Schmidt made up a story that made him sound like he had assaulted Cobb for a noble purpose</span>

				<span class='text'>When it was reported that [[Nap Lajoie]] had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb</span>

				<span class='text'>Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a &quot;cheapskate&quot; who never helped his teammates</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, &quot;so he blamed me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, insisting that Cobb had &quot;dreamed that up</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stump (1994), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>190–191&lt;/ref&gt;When asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to jealousy</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt that Crawford was &quot;a hell of a good player&quot;, but he was &quot;second best&quot; on the Tigers and &quot;hated to be an also ran</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two &quot;only barely tolerated each other&quot; and agreed with Cobb that Crawford's attitude was driven by Cobb's having stolen Crawford's thunder</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bak (2005), p</span>
				<span class='text'>38&lt;/ref&gt;Although they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an uncanny ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths</span>
				<span class='text'>They became one of the most successful [[double steal]] pairings in baseball history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bak (2005), p</span>
				<span class='text'>177&lt;/ref&gt;After Cobb died, a reporter found hundreds of letters in Cobb's home that Cobb had written to influential people lobbying for Crawford's induction into the Hall of Fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Crawford was reportedly unaware of Cobb's efforts until after Cobb had died</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bak (2005), p</span>
				<span class='text'>176&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1957, four years before Cobb's death</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Ty Cobb circa 1918]]As ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine stated, &quot;Violent confrontations were a recurring theme in Cobb's life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back&quot;/&gt; He committed several violent assaults during his playing time</span>
				<span class='text'> Victims of his sudden uncontrollable rages through the years included a black groundskeeper who attempted to shake Cobb's hand (as well as the man's wife whom Cobb choked) and a handicapped fan</span>
				<span class='text'> As he attacked the handicapped man, &quot;someone screamed for Cobb to stop, pointing out that the man had no hands</span>
				<span class='text'> 'I don't care if he has no feet!' Cobb yelled back, stomping Leuker until park police pulled him off</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back&quot;/&gt;  The handicapped man incurred Cobb's ire by suggesting he was of mixed ancestry</span>
				<span class='text'>hile, &quot;[s]tories of Cobb's racial intolerance were well documented&quot;, during his playing days, after Cobb left the game he appeared to have a change of heart regarding race</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back&quot;/&gt;  Five years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, Cobb publicly supported blacks and whites playing baseball together, adding, &quot;Certainly it is okay for them to play</span>
				<span class='text'>I see no reason in the world why we shouldn't compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility</span>
				<span class='text'>Let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man; in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, it should be noted that by 1952, when Cobb made that statement, over 150 African-American baseball players were already playing in fully integrated teams</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;One of the Game's Top Catchers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''Philadelphia Tribune'', August 8, 1953, p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following Campanella's accident that left him paralyzed, the Dodgers staged a tribute game where tens of thousands of spectators silently held lit matches above their heads</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb wrote the Dodgers owner to show appreciation &quot;for what you did for this fine man</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobb 2015, page 305&quot;/&gt; In the obituaries that ran in the black press following Cobb's death, he was praised for &quot;[speaking] in favor of racial freedom in baseball</span>
