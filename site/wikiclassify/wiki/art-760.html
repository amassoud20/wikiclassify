				<span class='text'>port11|title= Van Basten given Dutch reins|work=The Guardian|date=29 July 2004|accessdate= 17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Basten was named the new manager of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]], with van 't Schip as his assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Basten appointment of being manager of the Netherlands sparked a little controversy at the time, since Van Basten only just started his manager career and the media argued that he did not have a lot experience yet</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Basten himself had his doubts when the KNVB asked him to be the new manager, though he admitted that it &quot;is hard to pass up the opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;As a manager, he soon established himself as a man of strong principles</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Basten famously dropped regulars like [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Roy Makaay]] and benched [[Mark van Bommel]], because he believed that they were either past their prime or constantly underachieving</span>
				<span class='text'>here were also calls for Van Basten to call up [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who had retired from the national team six years earlier for a final &quot;hurrah&quot; as he was retiring that season</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Basten then revealed to the media that he never intended to do so despite Bergkamp's own willingness</span>
				<span class='text'>or probably the first time in decades, none of the &quot;Big Three&quot; Clubs ([[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[Feyenoord]]) provided the backbone for the national team</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, newcomer [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]] led the way with players such as [[Denny Landzaat]], [[Barry Opdam]], [[Barry van Galen]], [[Ron Vlaar]], [[Jan Kromkamp]] and [[Joris Mathijsen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>AZ, at the time a local small football club for Dutch standards, proved to be successful in the Dutch league and in the UEFA Cup</span>
				<span class='text'>Other unheralded choices were [[Khalid Boulahrouz]], [[Hedwiges Maduro]], [[Ryan Babel]] and [[Romeo Castelen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Basten had also wanted to include [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] forward [[Salomon Kalou]], but was thwarted when Kalou was denied Dutch citizenship by the immigration authorities headed by Dutch Minister of Integration [[Rita Verdonk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kalou eventually accepted a call-up to play for [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Van Basten was heavily criticised for dropping [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] (who had scored 28 goals for the Netherlands) before this game, in favour of [[Dirk Kuyt]], who did not score throughout the entire tournament</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 2006, Van Basten recalled exiled [[A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Milan|Milan]] midfielder [[Clarence Seedorf]] for a friendly against [[England national football team|England]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 2007, Van Basten announced the end of his long-running dispute with Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had previously declared never to play for a Dutch national squad with Van Basten as its manager</span>

				<span class='text'>In the quarter-finals, Van Basten faced fellow Dutchman [[Guus Hiddink]]'s [[Russia national football team|Russia]]</span>
