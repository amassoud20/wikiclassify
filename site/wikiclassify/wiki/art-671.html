				<span class='text'> He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as [[process philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), vii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology, among other areas</span>
				<span class='text'>n his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics</span>
				<span class='text'>His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–13), which he co-wrote with former student [[Bertrand Russell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]]</span>

				<span class='text'>tml</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to [[philosophy of science]], and finally to [[metaphysics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of [[western philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitehead argued that reality consists of [[Event (philosophy)|processes]] rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another</span>

				<span class='text'>Robert Mesle]], ''Process-Relational Philosophy: An Introduction to Alfred North Whitehead'' (West Conshohocken: Templeton Foundation Press, 2009), 9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly ''[[Process and Reality]]'' – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>hitehead's process philosophy argues that &quot;there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertMesle&quot; /&gt; For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and [[environmental ethics]] pioneered by [[John B</span>

				<span class='text'> Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence that Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity in 1884, Whitehead would teach and write on [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the college until 1910, spending the 1890s writing his ''Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (1898), and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil, [[Bertrand Russell]], on the first edition of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>He was elected Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Victor Lowe 1990&quot;/&gt; Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students</span>

				<span class='text'> Though he had no advanced training in philosophy, his philosophical work soon became highly regarded</span>
				<span class='text'> After publishing ''The Concept of Nature'' in 1920, he served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1922 to 1923</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During his time at Harvard, Whitehead produced his most important philosophical contributions</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925, he wrote ''Science and the Modern World'', which was immediately hailed as an alternative to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that plagued popular science</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A few years later, he published his seminal work ''[[Process and Reality]]'', which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipRose&quot; /&gt;The Whiteheads spent the rest of their lives in the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe_b&quot; /&gt;  This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, &quot;No professional biographer in his right mind would touch him</span>

				<span class='text'>sp?title=2753&lt;/ref&gt;==Views on education==Whitehead showed a deep concern for [[educational reform]] at all levels</span>
				<span class='text'> In addition to his numerous individually written works on the subject, Whitehead was appointed by Britain's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] as part of a 20-person committee to investigate the educational systems and practices of the UK in 1921 and recommend reform</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Committee To Inquire Into the Position of Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom, ''Report of the Committee Appointed by the Prime Minister to Inquire into the Position of Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom'', (London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1921), 1, 282</span>
				<span class='text'> Available online at https://archive</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/details/reportofcommitt00grea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Whitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'', which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927</span>
				<span class='text'> The essay from which ''Aims of Education'' derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead was president of the London Branch of the [[Mathematical Association]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called &quot;inert ideas&quot; – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture</span>
				<span class='text'> He opined that &quot;education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is, above all things, harmful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_g&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 1–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the [[multidisciplinary]], value-free school model&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_g&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs</span>
				<span class='text'>ancouversun&quot; /&gt; – it should be [[Transdisciplinarity|''trans''disciplinary]], and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate</span>
				<span class='text'>n order to make this sort of teaching a reality, however, Whitehead pointed to the need to minimize the importance of (or radically alter) [[Standardized test|standard examinations]] for school entrance</span>
				<span class='text'> Whitehead writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Every school is bound on pain of extinction to train its boys for a small set of definite examinations</span>
				<span class='text'>No headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies in accordance with the opportunities of his school, which are created by its staff, its environment, its class of boys, and its endowments</span>
				<span class='text'>I suggest that no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whitehead argued that curriculum should be developed specifically for its own students by its own staff, or else risk total stagnation, interrupted only by occasional movements from one group of inert ideas to another</span>
				<span class='text'>bove all else in his educational writings, Whitehead emphasized the importance of [[imagination]] and the free play of ideas</span>
				<span class='text'> In his essay &quot;Universities and Their Function&quot;, Whitehead writes provocatively on imagination:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Imagination is not to be divorced from the facts: it is a way of illuminating the facts</span>
				<span class='text'> It works by eliciting the general principles which apply to the facts, as they exist, and then by an intellectual survey of alternative possibilities which are consistent with those principles</span>
				<span class='text'> It enables men to construct an intellectual vision of a new world</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whitehead's philosophy of education might adequately be summarized in his statement that &quot;knowledge does not keep any better than fish</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 98</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless; all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students' own lives, or else it becomes so much useless trivia, and the students themselves become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe_c&quot; /&gt;  In fact, he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his [[undergraduate education]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and [[metaphysics]], but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur</span>
				<span class='text'> In one letter to his friend and former student [[Bertrand Russell]], after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: &quot;This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead to Bertrand Russell, February 13, 1895, Bertrand Russell Archives, Archives and Research Collections, McMaster Library, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Ironically, in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost [[List of metaphysicians|metaphysicians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, interest in metaphysics – the philosophical investigation of the nature of the universe and existence – had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'> The ever-more impressive accomplishments of [[empirical]] science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems was a waste of time because they were not subject to [[Empirical research|empirical testing]]</span>

				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Ayer]], ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (New York: Penguin, 1971), 22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection</span>
				<span class='text'> In the notes of one his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: &quot;Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'> What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned</span>
				<span class='text'> While Whitehead acknowledged that &quot;philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical [[first principle]]s,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently [[asymptotic]]</span>
				<span class='text'> For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Perhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favor of an [[Event (philosophy)|event]]-based or &quot;process&quot; [[ontology]] in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_a&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its [[experience]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He used the term &quot;experience&quot; very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience</span>
				<span class='text'>In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as &quot;philosophy of organism&quot;, but it would become known more widely as &quot;[[process philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth&quot; /&gt;Whitehead's philosophy was highly original, and soon garnered interest in philosophical circles</span>
				<span class='text'> After publishing ''The Concept of Nature'' in 1920, he served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1922 to 1923, and [[Henri Bergson]] was quoted as saying that Whitehead was &quot;the best philosopher writing in English</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 127, 133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  So impressive and different was Whitehead's philosophy that in 1924 he was invited to join the faculty at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of philosophy at 63 years of age</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe_d&quot; /&gt;[[Image:Eckhart Hall</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|250px|Eckhart Hall at the [[University of Chicago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning with the arrival of [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] in 1927, Chicago's [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] become closely associated with Whitehead's thought for about thirty years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GaryDorrien_a&quot;&gt;Gary Dorrien, ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Crisis, Irony, and Postmodernity, 1950–2005'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2006), 123–124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]This is not to say that Whitehead's thought was widely accepted or even well-understood</span>
				<span class='text'> His philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the [[western canon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipRose&quot; /&gt;  Even professional philosophers struggled to follow Whitehead's writings</span>
				<span class='text'> One famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of Whitehead's philosophy centers around the delivery of Whitehead's [[Gifford lectures]] in 1927–28 – following [[Arthur Eddington]]'s lectures of the year previous – which Whitehead would later publish as ''[[Process and Reality]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course</span>
				<span class='text'> The same audience turned up to Whitehead's first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect</span>
				<span class='text'> My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 250</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Indeed, it may not be inappropriate to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement</span>
				<span class='text'> Distinguished [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] [[theologian]] [[Shailer Mathews]] once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book ''Religion in the Making'': &quot;It is infuriating, and I must say embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GaryDorrien&quot;&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], &quot;The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology&quot;, ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 320</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;However, Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest</span>
				<span class='text'> In fact, there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School that perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1927 they invited one of America's only Whitehead experts – [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] – to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GaryDorrien&quot; /&gt;  Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GaryDorrien_a&quot; /&gt;Shortly after Whitehead's book ''[[Process and Reality]]'' appeared in 1929, Wieman famously wrote in his 1930 review:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Not many people will read Whitehead's recent book in this generation; not many will read it in any generation</span>
				<span class='text'>But its influence will radiate through concentric circles of popularization until the common man will think and work in the light of it, not knowing whence the light came</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few decades of discussion and analysis one will be able to understand it more readily than can now be done</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Nelson Wieman]], &quot;A Philosophy of Religion&quot;, ''The Journal of Religion'' 10 (1930): 137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wieman's words proved prophetic</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as Isabelle Stengers puts it – &quot;that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus</span>

				<span class='text'>Michael Chase (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2011), 6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works, but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Whitehead's Radically Different Postmodern Philosophy: An Argument for Its Contemporary Relevance'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007), viii–ix</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Whitehead's conception of reality===Whitehead was convinced that the scientific notion of [[matter]] was misleading as a way of describing the ultimate nature of things</span>
				<span class='text'> In his 1925 book ''Science and the Modern World'', he wrote that&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There persists&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[a] fixed scientific [[cosmology]] which presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute [[matter]], or material, spread through space in a flux of configurations</span>
				<span class='text'> In itself such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless</span>
				<span class='text'> It just does what it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external relations which do not spring from the nature of its being</span>
				<span class='text'> It is this assumption that I call 'scientific materialism</span>
				<span class='text'>  Also it is an assumption which I shall challenge as being entirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we have now arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_a&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Whitehead's view, there are a number of problems with this notion of &quot;irreducible brute matter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change</span>
				<span class='text'> By thinking of any material thing (like a rock, or a person) as being fundamentally the ''same'' thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its &quot;[[Nature (innate)|nature]]&quot;, scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same</span>
				<span class='text'> For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that &quot;all things flow</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 208</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as &quot;quality&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;, and &quot;form&quot; are problematic</span>
				<span class='text'>These &quot;classical&quot; concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>They are useful [[abstraction]]s, but are not the world's basic building blocks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 52–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 34–35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience</span>
				<span class='text'> These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a &quot;society&quot; of events</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] (what Whitehead calls the &quot;[[fallacy of misplaced concreteness]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 54–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;To put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a &quot;defining [[essence]]&quot; or a &quot;core [[Personal identity|identity]]&quot; that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person ''really is''</span>
				<span class='text'>In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete &quot;occasions of experience&quot; that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as &quot;the essence of a thing&quot; or &quot;the identity/core of a person&quot; is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time</span>
				<span class='text'> Identities do not define people, people define identities</span>
				<span class='text'> Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an &quot;enduring essence&quot; misses the fact that &quot;all things flow&quot;, though it is often a useful way of speaking</span>
				<span class='text'>hitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago</span>
				<span class='text'> Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that &quot;material substances&quot; or &quot;essences&quot; are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes</span>
				<span class='text'> No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or [[ontologically]] sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:JohnLocke</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|210px|left|thumb|[[John Locke]] was one of Whitehead's primary influences</span>
				<span class='text'> In the preface to ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Whitehead wrote: &quot;The writer who most fully anticipated the main positions of the [[philosophy of organism]] is John Locke in his [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_i&quot; /&gt;]]A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of ''relations''</span>
				<span class='text'> It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects</span>
				<span class='text'> Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only ''externally'' related to other things</span>
				<span class='text'> The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything</span>
				<span class='text'> But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 38–39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Reality applies to ''connections'', and only relatively to the things connected</span>
				<span class='text'> (A) is real for (B), and (B) is real for (A), but [they are] not absolutely real independent of each other</span>

				<span class='text'>Heath, &quot;Notes on Whitehead's Philosophy 3b: Philosophical Presuppositions of Science&quot;, September 27, 1924, Whitehead Research Project, Center for Process Studies, Claremont, California</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In fact, Whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its ''synthesis of'' and ''reaction to'' the world around it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the [[universe]] to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it was not ''related'' to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_b&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they ''are'' what the thing is</span>
				<span class='text'>t must be emphasized, however, that an entity is not ''merely'' a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  For Whitehead, [[creativity]] is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an [[electron]]) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by [[Causation (law)|causal]] or [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] laws</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, most entities do not have [[consciousness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_c&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow</span>
				<span class='text'> Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], &quot;Freedom Requires Indeterminism and Universal Causality&quot;, ''The Journal of Philosophy'' 55 (1958): 794</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The other side of creativity/freedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> its relations) – each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_b&quot; /&gt;  Freedom always exists within limits</span>
				<span class='text'> But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[John B</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1978), 52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In summary, Whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favor of the idea of reality as interrelated events in process</span>
				<span class='text'> He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic &quot;becoming&quot; rather than static &quot;being&quot;, emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve, and that changeless &quot;essences&quot; such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth&quot;/&gt;===Theory of perception===Since Whitehead's [[metaphysics]] described a universe in which all entities [[Experience#Subjective experience|experience]], he needed a new way of describing [[perception]] that was not limited to living, [[self-conscious]] beings</span>
				<span class='text'> The term he coined was &quot;prehension&quot;, which comes from the Latin ''prehensio'', meaning &quot;to seize</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidRay&quot;&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as [[electron]]s</span>
				<span class='text'> It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of ''representative'' perception, in which the [[mind]] only has private ideas about other entities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DavidRay&quot; /&gt;  For Whitehead, the term &quot;prehension&quot; indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DavidRay&quot; /&gt;  In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them</span>
				<span class='text'> Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, ''causal efficacy'' (or &quot;physical prehension&quot;) and ''presentational immediacy'' (or &quot;conceptual prehension&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_c&quot; /&gt;Whitehead describes causal efficacy as &quot;the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  It is, in other words, the sense of [[causal]] relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the [[sense]]s</span>
				<span class='text'> Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as &quot;pure sense perception&quot;, unmediated by any causal or [[symbol]]ic [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], even [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'> In other words, it is pure appearance, which may or may not be delusive (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>mistaking an image in a mirror for &quot;the real thing&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms &quot;symbolic reference&quot;, which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it</span>
				<span class='text'> By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair</span>
				<span class='text'> An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair</span>
				<span class='text'> However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, &quot;might not have jumped to the notion of a chair&quot;, but instead &quot;might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it</span>
				<span class='text'> Moreover, animals do the same thing</span>
				<span class='text'> Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog &quot;would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Evolution and value===Whitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence, questions about [[Teleology|value and purpose]] can never be fully escaped</span>
				<span class='text'> This is borne out in his thoughts on [[abiogenesis]], or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds</span>
				<span class='text'>hitehead makes the startling observation that &quot;life is comparatively deficient in survival value</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, &quot;they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction</span>
				<span class='text'> Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible</span>
				<span class='text'>or Whitehead, there is no such thing as wholly inert [[matter]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or [[creativity]], however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Process philosophy|Process philosopher]] [[David Ray Griffin]] coined the term &quot;[[Panexperientialism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]&quot; (the idea that all entities experience) to describe Whitehead's view, and to distinguish it from [[panpsychism]] (the idea that all matter has [[consciousness]])</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapters 4–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the Christian conception of God is that &quot;the Church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to [[Caesar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 342</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Here Whitehead is criticizing Christianity for defining God as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world, and whose most important attribute is power</span>
				<span class='text'> As opposed to the most widely accepted forms of Christianity, Whitehead emphasized an idea of God that he called &quot;the brief Galilean vision of humility&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover</span>
				<span class='text'> It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operates by love; and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world</span>
				<span class='text'> Love neither rules, nor is it unmoved; also it is a little oblivious as to [[morals]]</span>
				<span class='text'> It does not look to the future; for it finds its own reward in the immediate present</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_e&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 343</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It should be emphasized, however, that for Whitehead God is not necessarily tied to [[religion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_d&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than springing primarily from religious [[faith]], Whitehead saw God as necessary for his [[metaphysical]] system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_d&quot; /&gt;  His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities</span>
				<span class='text'> Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the ''primordial nature'' of God</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Whitehead was also interested in [[religious experience]]</span>
				<span class='text'> This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the ''consequent nature''</span>
				<span class='text'> Whitehead's conception of God as a &quot;dipolar&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 345</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; entity has called for fresh [[theological]] thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>he primordial nature he described as &quot;the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_e&quot; /&gt; i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the unlimited possibility of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'> This primordial nature is [[Eternity|eternal]] and [[Immutability (theology)|unchanging]], providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization</span>
				<span class='text'> Whitehead also calls this primordial aspect &quot;the lure for [[feeling]], the eternal urge of desire,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 344</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>od's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging – it is God's reception of the world's activity</span>
				<span class='text'> As Whitehead puts it, &quot;[God] saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life</span>
				<span class='text'> It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 346</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world</span>
				<span class='text'> In this way, God is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance</span>
				<span class='text'>hitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another</span>
				<span class='text'> He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time</span>
				<span class='text'> On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them</span>
				<span class='text'> God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change</span>
				<span class='text'> Here it is worthwhile to quote Whitehead at length:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In this way God is completed by the individual, fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute 'wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>  The final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of [[antitheses]], whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence</span>
				<span class='text'>In each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is as true to say that the World is [[immanent]] in God, as that God is immanent in the World</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;What is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven, and the reality in heaven passes back into the world&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, God is the great companion – the fellow-sufferer who understands</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 347–348, 351</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The above is some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as [[process theology]], a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapter 1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Religion===For Whitehead the core of religion was individual</span>
				<span class='text'> While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15–16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  His most famous remark on religion is that &quot;religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and if you are never solitary, you are never religious</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 16–17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's [[Character structure|character]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not ''necessarily'' good – an idea which he called a &quot;dangerous delusion&quot; (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;However, while Whitehead saw religion as ''beginning'' in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual</span>
				<span class='text'> In keeping with his [[Process philosophy#Process metaphysics|process metaphysics]] in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of &quot;the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community</span>
				<span class='text'> Whitehead writes further that each entity &quot;can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe</span>
				<span class='text'> Religion is world-loyalty</span>
				<span class='text'> The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;   In this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent</span>
				<span class='text'>hitehead also described religion more technically as &quot;an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of [[emotion]] that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance</span>
				<span class='text'> For Whitehead, religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people</span>
				<span class='text'>=Influence and legacy==[[Isabelle Stengers]] wrote that &quot;Whiteheadians are recruited among both [[philosopher]]s and [[theologian]]s, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from [[ecology]] to [[feminism]], practices that unite political struggle and [[spirituality]] with the [[Pedagogy|sciences of education]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IsabelleStengers&quot; /&gt;  Indeed, in recent decades attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology</span>
				<span class='text'> One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Temple's [[Gifford Lectures]] of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as &quot;Nature, Man and God&quot;), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the [[emergent evolution]] approach Temple interacts with</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;George Garin, &quot;Theistic Evolution in a Sacramental Universe: The Theology of William Temple Against the Background of Process Thinkers (Whitehead, Alexander, Etc</span>
				<span class='text'>,&quot; (Protestant University Press, Kinshasa, The Congo, 1991)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles</span>
				<span class='text'>arly followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School|University of Chicago's Divinity School]], where [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] initiated an interest in Whitehead's work that would last for about thirty years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;GaryDorrien_a&quot; /&gt;  Professors such as Wieman, [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Bernard Loomer]], Bernard Meland, and [[Daniel Day Williams]] made Whitehead's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the Divinity School</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], &quot;The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology&quot;, ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 321–322</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  They taught generations of Whitehead scholars, the most notable of which is [[John B</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobb]], Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough interest in Whitehead has since faded at Chicago's Divinity School, Cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in [[Claremont, California]], where he began teaching at [[Claremont School of Theology]] in 1958 and founded the [[Center for Process Studies]] with [[David Ray Griffin]] in 1973</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Largely due to Cobb's influence, today Claremont remains strongly identified with Whitehead's process thought</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;But while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China</span>
				<span class='text'> In order to address the challenges of [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]], China has begun to blend traditions of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]] with Whitehead's &quot;constructive post-modern&quot; philosophy in order to create an &quot;ecological civilization</span>

				<span class='text'> Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself</span>

				<span class='text'>rocess theology typically stresses God's relational nature</span>
				<span class='text'> Rather than seeing God as [[impassible]] (unchanging), process theologians view God as &quot;the fellow sufferer who understands&quot;, and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 351</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God?&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 42–43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world</span>
				<span class='text'> However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways</span>
				<span class='text'> C</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Education===Whitehead is widely known for his influence in [[education theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His philosophy inspired the formation of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education (APPE), which published eleven volumes of a journal titled ''Process Papers'' on [[process philosophy]] and education from 1996 to 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See ''Process Papers'', a publication of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education</span>
				<span class='text'> Volume 1 published in 1996, Volume 11 (final volume) published in 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead's theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>ne such model is the ANISA model developed by Daniel C</span>
				<span class='text'>Jordan, which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems</span>
				<span class='text'> As Jordan and Raymond P</span>
				<span class='text'>Shepard put it: &quot;Because it has not defined the nature of man, education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended</span>

				<span class='text'>Shepard, &quot;The Philosophy of the ANISA Model&quot;, ''Process Papers'' 6, 38–39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Another model is the FEELS model developed by Xie Bangxiu and deployed successfully in China</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;FEELS&quot; stands for five things in curriculum and education: Flexible-goals, Engaged-learner, Embodied-knowledge, Learning-through-interactions, and Supportive-teacher</span>
