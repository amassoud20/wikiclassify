				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite the arguably greater architectural inventiveness of Borromini and Cortona, Bernini's artistic pre-eminence, particularly during the reigns of popes [[Urban VIII]] (1623–44) and [[Alexander VII]] (1655–65), meant he was able to secure the most important commissions in the Rome of his day, the various massive embellishment projects of the newly finished [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica]], completed under Pope Paul V with the addition of Maderno's nave and facade and finally re-consecrated by Pope Urban VIII on November 18, 1626, after 150 years of planning and building</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini's design of the [[Piazza San Pietro]] in front of the Basilica is one of his most innovative and successful architectural designs</span>
				<span class='text'>Within the basilica he is also responsible for the Baldacchino, the decoration of the four piers under the cupola, the Cathedra Petri (Throne of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter) in the apse, the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the right nave, and the decoration (floor, walls and arches) of the new nave</span>
				<span class='text'>uring his long career, Bernini received numerous important commissions, many of which were associated with the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>At an early age, he came to the attention of the [[papal nephew]], [[Cardinal Scipione Borghese]], and in 1621, at the age of only twenty-three, he was knighted by Pope [[Gregory XV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his accession to the papacy, Urban VIII is reported to have said, &quot;It is a great fortune for you, O Cavaliere, to see Cardinal Maffeo Barberini made pope, but our fortune is even greater to have Cavalier Bernini alive in our pontificate</span>

				<span class='text'>ernini and other artists fell from favor in later [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] criticism of the [[Baroque]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is only from the late nineteenth century that art historical scholarship, in seeking an understanding of artistic output in the cultural context in which it was produced, has come to recognise Bernini's achievements and restore his artistic reputation</span>

				<span class='text'>His first works were inspired by antique [[classical sculpture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n the late 1630s he engaged in an affair with a married woman named Costanza (wife of his workshop assistant, Matteo Bonucelli, also called Bonarelli) and sculpted a bust of her (now in the Bargello, Florence) during the height of their romance</span>
				<span class='text'>She later had an affair with his younger brother, who was Bernini's right-hand man in his studio</span>
				<span class='text'>When Gian Lorenzo found out about Costanza and his brother, in a fit of mad fury, he chased his brother Luigi through the streets of Rome, intent on murdering him</span>
				<span class='text'>To punish his unfaithful mistress, Bernini had a servant go to the house of Costanza to slash her face several times with a razor</span>
				<span class='text'>The servant was later jailed, and Costanza was jailed for adultery</span>

				<span class='text'>99-106</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bernini died in Rome in 1680, and was buried in the Bernini's family vault, along with his parents, in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early works for Cardinal Borghese==[[File:Apollo &amp; Daphne September 2a</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'' (1622–25)]]Under the patronage of the extravagantly wealthy and most powerful Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the young Bernini rapidly rose to prominence as a sculptor</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the early works for the cardinal were decorative pieces for the garden of the [[Villa Borghese]] such as ''[[The Goat Amalthea with the Infant Jupiter and a Faun]]'', and several allegorical [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]], including the ''[[Damned Soul (Bernini)|Damned Soul]]'' and ''[[Blessed Soul (Bernini)|Blessed Soul]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time he was twenty-two, he was considered talented enough to have been given a commission for a papal portrait, the ''[[Bust of Pope Paul V (Bernini)|Bust of Pope Paul V]]'', now in the J</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul Getty Museum</span>
				<span class='text'>ernini's reputation, however, was definitively established by four masterpieces, executed between 1619 and 1625, all now displayed in the Galleria Borghese in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>To the art historian Rudolf Wittkower these four works—''[[Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius]]'' (1619), ''[[The Rape of Proserpina (Bernini)|The Rape of Proserpina]]'' (1621–22), ''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'' (1622–25), and ''[[David (Bernini)|David]]'' (1623–24)—&quot;inaugurated a new era in the history of European sculpture&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is a view repeated by other scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Hibbard, as well as other scholars, are more reticent about the overall quality of the earliest of these sculptures, of [[Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Adapting the classical grandeur of Renaissance sculpture and the dynamic energy of the Mannerist period, Bernini forged a new,distinctly Baroque conception for religious and historical sculpture, powerfully imbued with dramatic realism, stirring emotion and dynamic, theatrical compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini's early sculpture groups and portraits manifest &quot;a command of the human form in motion and a technical sophistication rivalled only by the greatest sculptors of classical antiquity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Clifford and Michael Clarke, Foreword, ''Effigies and Ecstasies: Roman Barowue Sculpture and Design in the Age of Bernini,'' Edinburgh: National Gallery of Scotland, 1998, p</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Unlike those done by his predecessors, these sculptures focus on specific points of narrative tension in the stories they are trying to tell: Aeneas and his family fleeing the burning Troy; the instant that Pluto finally grasps the hunted Persephone; the precise moment that Apollo sees his beloved Daphne begin her transformation into a tree</span>
				<span class='text'>They are transitory but dramatic powerful moments in each story</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini's ''David'' is another stirring example of this</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Michelangelo's motionless, idealized ''David''—which shows the subject holding a rock in one hand and a sling in the other, contemplating the battle, or similarly immobile versions by other Renaissance artists, notably Donatello's—which show the subject in his triumph after the battle with Goliath, Bernini illustrates David during his active combat with the giant, as he twists his body to catapult toward Goliath</span>
				<span class='text'>To emphasize these moments, and to ensure that they were appreciated by the viewer, Bernini designed the sculptures with a specific viewpoint in mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Their original placements within the Villa Borghese were against walls, so that the viewers' first view was the dramatic moment of the narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, p</span>
				<span class='text'>15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>53-54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The result of such an approach is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy</span>
				<span class='text'>The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth in fear and astonishment, David biting his lip in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details</span>
				<span class='text'>The tousled hair of Pluto, the pliant flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude and delight for representing complex real world textures in marble form</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14–15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica]]]]In 1623, upon the ascent of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini to the papal throne as Pope Urban VIII, and Bernini's subsequent near monopolistic patronage from the Barberini pope and family, the artist's horizons rapidly and widely broadened</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not just producing sculpture for private residences, but playing the most significant artistic (and engineering) role on the city stage, as sculptor, architect, and urban planner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, p</span>
				<span class='text'>68&lt;/ref&gt; His official appointments also testify to this – &quot;curator of the papal art collection, director of the papal foundry at Castel Sant'Angelo, commissioner of the fountains of Piazza Navona&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mormando, p</span>
				<span class='text'>72&lt;/ref&gt; Such positions gave Bernini the opportunity to demonstrate his versatile skills throughout the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps most significantly and to great protest from older, most experienced architects, he was appointed Chief Architect of St Peter's in 1629, upon the death of Carlo Maderno</span>
				<span class='text'>From then on, Bernini's work and artistic vision would be placed at the symbolic heart of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Baldacchino|St Peter's Baldacchino]] was the centerpiece of his ambitious plans for the embellishment of the recently completed but still rather unadorned St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's</span>
				<span class='text'>Designed as a massive spiraling gilded bronze canopy over the tomb of St Peter, Bernini's four-pillared creation reached nearly {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground and cost around 200,000 Roman scudi (about $8m in currency of the early 21st century)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and HIs Rome,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Baldacchino|St Peter's Baldacchino]], Bernini undertook the whole-scale embellishment of the four massive piers at crossing of the basilica (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the structures supporting the cupola) including, most notably, four colossal, theatrically dramatic statues, among them, the majestic [[Saint Longinus (Bernini)|St Longinus]] executed by Bernini himself (the other three are by other contemporary sculptors François Duquesnoy, Francesco Mochi, and Bernini's disciple, Andrea Bolgi)</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini also began work on the tomb for Urban VIII, completed only after Urban's death in 1644, one in a long, distinguished series of tombs and funerary monuments for which Bernini is famous and a traditional genre upon which his influence left an enduring mark, often copied by subsequent artists</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''Bust of Cardinal Armand de Richelieu'' (1640–41)]]Despite this engagement with public architecture, Bernini was still able to produce artworks that showed the gradual refinement of his portrait technique</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of Bernini's sculptures show the continual evolution of his ability to capture the utterly distinctive personal characteristics that he saw in his sitters</span>
				<span class='text'>This included a number of busts of Urban VIII himself, the family [[Bust of Francesco Barberini (Bernini)|bust of Francesco Barberini]] or most notably, the [[Two Busts of Scipione Borghese]] – the second of which had been rapidly created by Bernini once a flaw had been found in the marble of the first</span>

				<span class='text'>88&quot;/&gt;One noted portrait in marble is the lively, sensual one of [[Bust of Costanza Bonarelli|Costanza Bonarelli]] (executed around 1637), unusual in its more personal, intimate nature (in fact, it would appear to be the first fully finished marble portrait of a non-aristocratic woman by a major artist in European history)</span>
				<span class='text'>As already mentioned, Bernini had an affair with Costanza, who was the wife of one of his assistants</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'', 1651]]Under Urban VIII, Bernini had been appointed chief architect for the basilica of St Peter's</span>
				<span class='text'>Work by Bernini included the aforementioned Baldacchino and the St Longinus</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1636, eager to finally finish the exterior of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's, Pope Urban ordered Bernini to design and build the two long-intended bell towers for its facade: the foundations of the two towers had already been designed and constructed (namely, the last bays at either extremity of the facade) by Carlo Maderno (architect of the nave and the facade) decades earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Once the first tower was finished in 1641, cracks began to appear in the facade but, curiously enough, work continued on the second tower and the first story was completed</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the presence of the cracks, work only stopped in July 1642 once the papal treasury had been exhausted by the disastrous War of Castro</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of Pope Urban and the ascent to power of Barberini-enemy in 1644, Pope Innocent X Pamphilj, Bernini's enemies (especially Borromini) raised a great alarm over the cracks, predicting a disaster for the whole basilica and placing the blame entirely on Bernini</span>
				<span class='text'>The subsequent investigations in fact revealed the cause of the cracks as Maderno's defective foundations and not Bernini's elaborate design, an exoneration later confirmed by the meticulous investigation conducted in 1680 under Pope Innocent XI</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Nonetheless, Bernini's opponents in Rome succeeded in seriously damaging the reputation of Urban's artist and in persuading the pope to order (in February 1646) the complete demolition of both towers, to Bernini's great humiliation and indeed financial detriment</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, one of the rare failures of his career, Bernini retreated into himself: according to his son, Domenico</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini's subsequent unfinished statue of 1647, [[Truth Unveiled by Time (Bernini)|Truth Unveiled by Time]], was intended to be his self-consoling commentary on this affair, expressing his faith that eventually Time would reveal the actual Truth behind the story and exonerate him fully, as indeed did occur</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless, this affair did not mean that Bernini entirely lost patronage, not even of the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Innocent X maintained Bernini in all of the official roles given to him by Urban</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Bernini's design and careful direction, work continued on decorating the massive new but entirely unadorned nave of St Peters, with the addition of an elaborate multi-colored marble flooring, marble facing on the walls and pilasters, and scores of stuccoed statues and reliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not without reason that Pope Alexander VII once quipped, 'if one were to remove from Saint Peter's everything that had been made by the Cavalier Bernini, that temple would be stripped bare</span>
				<span class='text'> Indeed, given all of his many and various works within the basilica over several decades, it is to Bernini that is due the lion's share of responsibility for the final and enduring aesthetic appearance and emotional impact of St</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was also allowed to continue to work on Urban VIII's tomb, despite Innocent's antipathy for the Barberini</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mormando, p150&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after completing Urban's tomb, Bernini won, under controversial circumstances, the Pamphilj commission for the prestigious [[Four Rivers Fountain]] on Piazza Navona, marking the end of his disgrace and the beginning a yet another glorious chapter in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Gian lorenzo bernini, Cenotafio di Suor Maria Raggi (1647-53)</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|left|''[[Memorial to Maria Raggi]]'', 1651]]If there had been doubts over Bernini's position as Rome's preeminent artist, the success of the Four Rivers Fountain removed them</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini continued to receive commissions from Pope Innocent X and other senior members of Rome's clergy and aristocracy, as well as from exalted patrons outside of Rome, such as [[Bust of Francesco I d'Este|Francesco d'Este]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In such an environment, Bernini's artistic style flourished</span>
				<span class='text'>New types of funerary monument were designed, such as the seemingly floating medallion, hovering in the air as it were, for the deceased nun [[Memorial to Maria Raggi|Maria Raggi]], while chapels he designed, such as the Raimondi Chapel in the church of [[San Pietro in Montorio]], illustrated how Bernini could use hidden lighting to help suggest divine intervention within the narratives he was depicting</span>
				<span class='text'>ut even before the Navona fountain design, it was the commission for the Cornaro Chapel that had demonstrated Bernini's innovative skill</span>
				<span class='text'>The chapel showcased his ability to integrate sculpture, architecture, fresco, stucco, and lighting into &quot;a marvelous whole&quot; (''bel composto'', to use early biographer Filippo Baldinucci's term to describe Bernini's approach to architecture) and thus create what scholar Irving Lavin has called the &quot;unified work of art&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The central focus of the Cornaro Chapel is the ecstasy of the Spanish nun and saint-mystic, Teresa of Avila</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lavin, Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts, passim&lt;/ref&gt; Bernini presents the spectator with a theatrically vivid portrait, in gleaming white marble, of the swooning Teresa and the quietly smiling angel, who delicately grips the arrow piercing the saint's heart</span>
				<span class='text'>On either side of the chapel the artist places (in what can only strike the viewer as theater boxes), portraits in relief of various members of the Cornaro family—the Venetian family memorialized in the chapel, including Cardinal Federico Cornaro who commissioned the chapel from Bernini— who are in animated conversation among themselves, presumably about the event taking place before them</span>
				<span class='text'>The result is a complex but subtly orchestrated architectural environment providing the spiritual context (a heavenly setting with a hidden source of light) that suggests to viewers the ultimate nature of this miraculous event</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lavin, ibid</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was an artistic tour de force that incorporates all of the multiple forms of visual art and technique that Bernini had at his disposal, including hidden lighting, thin gilded beams, recessive architectural space, secret lens, and over twenty diverse types of colored marble: these all combine to create the final artwork—&quot;a perfected, highly dramatic and deeply satisfying seamless ensemble&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>159&lt;/ref&gt;==Beautifying the city: Bernini and Alexander VII==Upon his accession to the Chair of St Peter, Pope Alexander VII Chigi (1655–67) began to implement his extremely ambitious (but in the end largely successful) plan to transform Rome into a magnificent world capital by means of systematic, bold (and costly) urban planning</span>
				<span class='text'>In so doing, he brought to fruition the long, slow recreation of the urban glory of Rome—the &quot;renovatio Romae&quot;—that had begun in the fifteenth century under the Renaissance popes</span>
				<span class='text'> Alexander immediately commissioned large-scale architectural changes in the city, for example, connecting new and existing buildings by opening up streets and piazzas</span>
				<span class='text'>It is no coincidence that Bernini’s career showed a greater focus on designing buildings (and their immediate surroundings) during this pontificate, as there were far greater opportunities</span>

				<span class='text'>Peter's Square|piazza leading to St Peter's]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Previously a broad, unstructured space, Bernini created two massive semi-circular colonnades, each row of which was formed of four white columns</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in an oval shape that formed a spectacular, inclusive arena within which any gathering citizens, pilgrims and visitors could witness the appearance of the pope – either as he appeared on the loggia on the facade of St Peter's or on balconies on the neighbouring Vatican palaces</span>
				<span class='text'>Often likened to two arms reaching out from the church to embrace the waiting crowd, Bernini's creation extended the symbolic greatness of the Vatican area, creating an &quot;exhiliarating expanse&quot; that was, architecturally, an &quot;unequivocal success&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>204&lt;/ref&gt; The long, broad, straight avenue (Via della Conciliazione) to the river Tiber was an early twentieth-century addition, when [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered the clearing of housing that led up to Bernini's piazza in order to afford a more commodious access to the Vatican</span>
				<span class='text'>lsewhere within the Vatican area, Bernini made systematic rearrangements of space that exist to the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Cathedra Petri]], the symbolic throne of St Peter in the apse of the basilica, was rearranged as a monumental golden extravagance that matched the [[Baldacchino]] created earlier in the century</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini's restoration of the Scala Regia, the papal stairway between St Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers to create a seemingly uniform stairway to connect two irregular buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>163–7&lt;/ref&gt;Not all works during this era were on such a large scale</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, the commission Bernini received to build the church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] for the Jesuits was relatively modest in size and payment for Bernini</span>
				<span class='text'>But Sant'Andrea shared with the St Peter's piazza – unlike the complex geometries of his rival [[Francesco Borromini]] – a focus on basic geometric shapes, circles and ovals to create spiritually intense buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>144–8&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Bernini moderated the presence of colour and decoration within these buildings, focussing visitors' attention on these simple forms that underpinned the building</span>
				<span class='text'>Sculptural decoration was never eliminated, but its use was more minimal</span>
				<span class='text'>The church of Santa Maria dell'Assunzione in the town of [[Arricia]] with its circular outline, rounded dome and three-arched portico is particularly noteworthy in this respect</span>

				<span class='text'>1665]]At the end of April 1665, and still considered the most important artist in Rome, if indeed not in all of Europe, Bernini was forced by political pressure (from both the French court and Pope Alexander VII) to travel to Paris to work for King Louis XIV, who required an architect to complete work on the royal palace of the Louvre</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini would remain in Paris until mid-October</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis XIV assigned a member of his court to serve as Bernini's translator, tourist guide, and overall companion, [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]], who kept a ''Journal'' of Bernini's visit that records much of Bernini's behaviour and utterances in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Gould, Cecil</span>
				<span class='text'>''Bernini in France, an episode in Seventeenth Century History'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;The trip began well; Bernini's popularity was such that on his walks in Paris the streets were lined with admiring crowds</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Chantelou, Bernini failed to forge significant friendships at the French court</span>
				<span class='text'>His frequent negative comments on various aspects of French culture, especially its art and architecture, did not go down well, particularly in juxtaposition to his praise for the art and architecture of Italy (especially Rome); he said that a painting by [[Guido Reni]] was worth more than all of Paris</span>

				<span class='text'>Amongst his secular works are a number of Roman palaces: following the death of Carlo Maderno, he took over the supervision of the building works at the [[Palazzo Barberini]] from 1630 on which he worked with [[Borromini]]; the [[Palazzo Ludovisi]] (now Palazzo Montecitorio, started 1650); and the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi, started 1664)</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1629, and before ''[[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Baldachin]]'' was complete, [[Urban VIII]] put him in charge of all the ongoing architectural works at St Peter's</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Bernini fell out of favor during the papacy of Innocent X [[Pamphili]]: one reason was the pope's animosity towards the Barberini and hence towards their clients including Bernini</span>
				<span class='text'>Another reason was the failure of the belltowers designed and built by Bernini for St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Basilica, commencing during the reign of Urban VIII</span>
				<span class='text'>The completed north tower and the only partially completed south tower were ordered demolished by Innocent in 1646 because their excessive weight had caused cracks in the basilica's facade and threatened to do more calamitous damage</span>
				<span class='text'>Professional opinion at the time was in fact divided over the true gravity of the situation (with Bernini's rival Borromini spreading an extreme, anti-Bernini catastrophic view of the problem) and over the question of responsibility for the damage: Who was to blame? Bernini? Pope Urban VIII who forced Bernini to design over-elaborate towers? Deceased Architect of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's, Carlo Maderno who built the weak foundations for the towers? Official papal investigations in 1680 in fact completely exonerated Bernini, while inculpating Maderno</span>

				<span class='text'>''Bernini and the Bell Towers: Architecture and Politics at the Vatican'', Yale University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Never wholly without patronage during the Pamphilj years, after Innocent's death in 1655 Bernini regained a major role in the decoration of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's with the [[Pope Alexander VII]] [[House of Chigi|Chigi]], leading to his design of the piazza and [[colonnade]] in front of St</span>

				<span class='text'>Further significant works by Bernini at the Vatican include the ''[[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]]'' (1663–66), the monumental grand stairway entrance to the Vatican Palace, and the ''[[Chair of Saint Peter|Cathedra Petri]]'', the Chair of Saint Peter, in the apse of St</span>

				<span class='text'>Peter's</span>
				<span class='text'>He fulfilled three commissions for new churches; his stature allowed him the freedom to design the structure and decorate the interiors in a consistent manner</span>
				<span class='text'>Best known is the small but richly ornamented oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]], done (beginning in 1658) for the Jesuit novitiate, representing one of the rare works of his hand with which Bernini's son, Domenico, reports that his father was truly and very pleased</span>

				<span class='text'>hen Bernini was invited to Paris in 1665 to prepare works for [[Louis XIV]], he presented designs for the east facade of the Louvre Palace, but his projects were ultimately turned down in favour of the more stern and classic proposals of the French doctor and amateur architect [[Claude Perrault]],&lt;ref&gt;Probably made in collaboration with [[Lebrun]] and [[Le Vau]], Blunt, Anthony</span>

				<span class='text'>232&lt;/ref&gt; signalling the waning influence of Italian artistic hegemony in France</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernini's projects were essentially rooted in the Italian Baroque urbanist tradition of relating public buildings to their settings, often leading to innovative architectural expression in urban spaces like ''piazze'' or squares</span>
				<span class='text'>However, by this time, the French absolutist monarchy now preferred the classicising monumental severity of Perrault's facade, no doubt with the added political bonus that it had been designed by a Frenchman</span>
				<span class='text'>The final version did, however, include Bernini's feature of a flat roof behind a Palladian balustrade</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1639, Bernini bought property on the corner of the via della Mercede and the via del [[Collegio di Propaganda Fide]] in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>He refurbished and expanded the existing palazzo on the site, at what are now Nos</span>
				<span class='text'>11 and 12 via della Mercede</span>
				<span class='text'>(The building is sometimes referred to as &quot;Palazzo Bernini,&quot; but that title more properly pertains to the Bernini family's latter and larger home on Via del Corso, to which they moved in the eighteenth century</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''[[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]'']]True to the decorative dynamism of Baroque, among Bernini's most gifted creations were his Roman [[fountain]]s, which were both public works and papal monuments</span>
				<span class='text'>His fountains include the ''[[Triton Fountain|Fountain of the Triton]]'', or ''Fontana del Tritone'', and the Barberini Fountain of the Bees, the ''[[Fontana delle Api]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This was dismantled in the nineteenth century and reassembled (incorrectly) in the twentieth in the Via Veneto</span>
				<span class='text'>A second ''Fontana delle Api'' in the Vatican has sometimes been attributed to Bernini of which Blunt has written, &quot;Borromini is documented as having carved the fountain in 1626, but it is not certain whether he made the design for it, and it has also been attributed—not very plausibly—to Bernini</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1665, painted by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]]]Among Bernini's most popular works (but one not mentioned by either of his earliest biographers, Baldinucci or Domenico Bernini) is the [[Elephant and Obelisk]] located near the Pantheon, in the Piazza della Minerva, in front of the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope [[Alexander VII]] decided that he wanted a small ancient Egyptian [[obelisk]] (that was discovered beneath the [[piazza]]) to be erected on the same site, and in 1665 he commissioned Bernini to create a sculpture to support the obelisk</span>
				<span class='text'>The sculpture of an elephant bearing the obelisk on its back was executed by one of Bernini's students, [[Ercole Ferrata]], upon a design by Bernini and finished in 1667</span>
				<span class='text'>An inscription on the base relates the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Roman goddess Minerva to the Virgin Mary, who supposedly supplanted those pagan goddesses and to whom the church is dedicated</span>

				<span class='text'>155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A popular anecdote concerns the elephant's smile</span>
				<span class='text'>To find out why it is smiling, legend has it, the viewer must examine the rear end of the animal and notice that its muscles are tensed and its tail is shifted to the left as if it were defecating</span>
				<span class='text'>The animal's rear is pointed directly at one of the headquarters of the Dominican Order, housing the offices of its Inquisitors as well as the office of Father Giuseppe Paglia, a [[Dominican friar]] who was one of the main antagonists of Bernini, as a final salute and last word</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This anecdote regarding the Elephant and Obelisk monument (more formally, it is a monument to Divine Wisdom and a tribute to Pope Alexander VII) is one of the many undocumented popular legends circulating about Bernini</span>
				<span class='text'>To begin with, the elephant is not smiling</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, even though he may have had professional reasons to resent Paglia, the conservative, pious and utterly orthodox Bernini personally had no grudges against the Dominican Order or the Inquisition</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Fr</span>
				<span class='text'>Giuseppe Paglia was director of the overall project to reconstruct the piazza in front of Santa Maria Minerva, appointed by Pope Alexander VII himself and, as such, had supervisory authority over Bernini and the design of his Elephant and Obelisk monument</span>
				<span class='text'>The final design of that monument, in fact, owes much to Paglia's direct intervention</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, it is unlikely that Paglia (or Pope Alexander) would have allowed this supposed insult to him or his Dominican order</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, if Bernini did intend to deliver this visual insult, he failed totally, for there is no contemporary documentation indicating that visitors to the piazza during the artist's lifetime ever noticed the supposed insult: see Franco Mormando, ed</span>

				<span class='text'>Instead, the origins of this anecdote can be traced to the very end of the 17th century, when the satirist, Cardinal Lodovico Sergardi, circulated a two-line epigram in which the elephant tells the Dominicans that the position of his rear end is meant to announce 'where I hold you in my esteem' (see Ingrid Rowland, 'The Friendship of Alexander VII and Athanasius Kircher, 1637-1667' in ''Early Modern Rome: Proceedings of a Conference Held on May 13–15, 2010 in Rome,'' ed</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The grave of Bernini in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]Among his minor commissions, in 1677 Bernini worked along with [[Ercole Ferrata]] to create a fountain for the Lisbon palace of the Portuguese nobleman, the Count of Ericeira: copying his earlier fountains, Bernini supplied the design of the fountain sculpted by Ferrata, featuring Neptune with four tritons around a basin</span>
				<span class='text'>he fountain has survived: since 1945 located outside the precincts of the gardens of the Palacio Nacional de Queluz, several miles outside of Lisbon</span>

				<span class='text'>804-811</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For the same patron he also supposedly created a series of paintings with the battles of Louis XIV as subject</span>
				<span class='text'>These works were lost as the palace, its great library and the rich art collection of the Counts of Ericeira, were destroyed along with most of central Lisbon as a result of the great earthquake of 1755</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;What is the source of this information about Bernini's supposed authorship of the paintings in question? highly doubtful claim</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the 1620s, encouraged by Pope Urban VIII who wanted him to fresco the Benediction Loggia of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's (never executed), Bernini began in earnest to develop and perfect his technique as a painter</span>
				<span class='text'>He probably had learned the basics from his father who was a painter as well, in addition to some training in the studio of the Florentine painter, Cigoli</span>
				<span class='text'>According to early biographers, Baldinucci and Domenico Bernini, Bernini completed at least 150 canvases, mostly in the decades of the 1620s and 30s, but currently there are no more than 35-40 surviving paintings that can be confidently attributed to his hand (they are mostly close-up faces—including several wonderfully wrought self-portraits—set against a blank background, employing a loose, painterly brushstroke (similar to that of his Spanish contemporary Velasquez) and a very limited palette of mostly somber colors with deep chiaroscuro</span>
				<span class='text'>The only one that is securely dated is that of the Apostles Andrew and Thomas in London's National Gallery</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As for his drawings, about 300 still exist; but this is a minuscule percentage of the drawings he would have created in his lifetime; these include rapid sketches relating to major sculptural or architectural commissions, presentation drawings given as gifts to his patrons and aristocratic friends, and exquisite, fully finished portraits, such as those of Agostino Mascardi (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris) and Scipione Borghese and Sisinio Poli (both in New York's Morgan Library)</span>

				<span class='text'>=First biographies of Bernini==The most important primary source for the life of Bernini is the biography written by his youngest son, Domenico, entitled ''Vita del Cavalier Gio</span>
				<span class='text'>Lorenzo Bernino,'' published in 1713 though first compiled in the last years of his father's life (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1675–80)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For a list and discussion of important sources for Bernini's life, see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7–11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Filippo Baldinucci's ''Life of Bernini,'' was published in 1682, and a meticulous private journal, the ''Diary of the Cavaliere Bernini's Visit to France,'' was kept by the Frenchman [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]] during the artist's four-month stay from June through October 1665 at the court of King Louis XIV</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, there is a short biographical narrative, ''The Vita Brevis of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'', written by his eldest son, Monsignor Pietro Filippo Bernini, in the mid-1670s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For an unabridged translation and analysis of ''The Vita Brevis,'' see ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini'' in Mormando, ed</span>
				<span class='text'> 201 Appendix 1, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>237–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Until the late 20th century, it was generally believed that two years after Bernini's death, Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], then living in Rome, commissioned [[Filippo Baldinucci]] to write his biography, which was published in Florence in 1682</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Baldinucci, Filippo, ''Life of Bernini''</span>
				<span class='text'>Translated from the Italian by Enggass, C</span>
				<span class='text'>University Park, Penn State University Press, 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, the Enggass edition of Baldinucci contains many translation errors; readers should always consult the text of the original 1682 edition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, recent research now strongly suggests that it was in fact Bernini's sons (and specifically the eldest son, Mons</span>
				<span class='text'>Pietro Filippo) who commissioned the biography from Baldinucci sometime in the late 1670s, with the intent of publishing it while their father was still alive</span>
				<span class='text'>This would mean that first, the commission did not at all originate in Queen Christina who would have merely lent her name as patron (in order to hide the fact that the biography was coming directly from the family) and secondly, that Baldinucci's narrative was largely derived from some pre-publication version of Domenico Bernini's much longer biography of his father, as evidenced by the extremely large amount of text repeated verbatim (there is no other explanation, otherwise, for the massive amount of verbatim repetition, and it is known that Baldinucci routinely copied verbatim material for his artists' biographies supplied by family and friends of his subjects)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Mormando, ''Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini,'' 2011, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>14–34</span>
				<span class='text'>It is significant that Christina's extant financial records nowhere report the queen's having monetarily subsidized the publication Baldinucci's biography, which would have been her responsibility as patron</span>
				<span class='text'>As Mormando further explains, we also know that in compiling his famous collection of artists' lives, Baldinucci routinely copied material, word for word, from texts supplied to him by family members and close friends and associates of his subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Also significant is the fact that in Domenico's biography of his father, the author is completely silent about the queen's supposed patronage of the Baldinucci biography, a strange omission since he devotes much space to the friendship between Gian Lorenzo and Queen Christina, recording the queen's many signs of favoritism, protection, and adulation towards the artist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As the most detailed account and the only one coming directly from a member of the artist's immediate family, Domenico's biography, though published later than Baldinucci's, therefore represents the earliest and more important full-length biographical source of Bernini's life, even though it idealizes its subject and whitewashes a number of less-than-flattering facts about his life and personality</span>
