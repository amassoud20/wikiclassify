				<span class='text'>As an interesting point, Ms</span>
				<span class='text'>Tharp indicated that ''The Creative Habit'' is about [[cybernetics]], especially in the several Greek-themed creative exercises, such as the Coin Drop; the Coin Drop, as an exercise in extracting ordered meaning from chaos, is derived from the astrological [[muse]], [[Urania]], in that random coins falling onto a flat surface can be used to develop pattern analysis skills</span>
				<span class='text'>The astrological theme is, in fact, an etymological underpinning of cybernetics' tradition of &quot;guiding a boat&quot; by sighting stellar references in a dynamic and synthetic way according to ancient Greek [[Navigation#Celestial navigation|navigation]]</span>
