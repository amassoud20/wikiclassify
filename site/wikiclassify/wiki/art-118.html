				<span class='text'>His early shorts—such as Biograph's ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' (1912), the first &quot;gangster film&quot;—show that Griffith's attention to camera placement and lighting heightened mood and tension</span>
				<span class='text'>In making ''Intolerance,'' the director opened up new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditional narrative</span>
