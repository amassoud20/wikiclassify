				<span class='text'>They were called the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theater]], which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by [[Clifford Odets]], ''Waiting for Lefty'', and his performance was called &quot;dynamic,&quot; leading some to describe him as the &quot;proletarian thunderbolt</span>
