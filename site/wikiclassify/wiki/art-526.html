				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; 11 January 347&amp;nbsp;–  17 January 395), also known as '''Theodosius the Great''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from AD 379 to AD 395</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern]] and the [[Western Roman Empire|western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against [[Goths]] and other barbarians who had invaded the Empire; he failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the [[Gothic War (376-382)|Gothic War]] they established a homeland south of the [[Danube]], in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], within the empire's borders</span>
				<span class='text'>He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers [[Magnus Maximus]] and [[Eugenius]] at great cost to the power of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>e also issued decrees that effectively made orthodox [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] [[Christianity]] the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; He neither prevented nor punished the destruction of prominent [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic]] temples of classical antiquity, including the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]] and the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He dissolved the order of the [[Vestal Virgins]] in [[Rome]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 393, he banned the pagan rituals of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympics in Ancient Greece]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(It was not until the end of the 19th century, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], that [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] were held again</span>
				<span class='text'> After his death, Theodosius' young sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] inherited the East and West halves respectively, and the Roman Empire was never again re-united, though Byzantine Emperors after [[Zeno_(emperor)|Zeno]] would claim the united title after [[Julius Nepos]]' death in 480 AD</span>
				<span class='text'>==Career==Theodosius was born in [[Coca, Segovia|Cauca]], [[Gallaecia]], [[Hispania]] (according to [[Hydatius]] and [[Zosimus]])&lt;ref&gt;Hydatius ''Chronicon'', year 379, II&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Italica]], [[Baetica]], [[Hispania]] (according to [[Marcellinus Comes]], writing later), to a senior military officer, [[Count Theodosius|Theodosius the Elder]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Theodosius learned his military lessons by campaigning with his father's staff in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] where he went to help quell the [[Great Conspiracy]] in 368</span>
				<span class='text'>n about 373 he became governor of Upper Moesia and oversaw hostilities against the Sarmatians and thereafter against the Alemanni</span>

				<span class='text'>oman-empire</span>
				<span class='text'>et/collapse/theodosius-I</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;  He was military commander (''[[dux]]'') of [[Moesia]], a Roman province on the lower [[Danube]], in 374</span>
				<span class='text'>However, shortly thereafter, and at about the same time as the sudden disgrace and execution of his father, Theodosius retired to Hispania</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason for his retirement, and the relationship (if any) between it and his father's death is unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that he was dismissed from his command by the emperor [[Valentinian I]] after the loss of two of Theodosius' legions to the [[Sarmatians]] in late 374</span>
				<span class='text'>he death of Valentinian I in 375 created political pandemonium</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing further persecution on account of his family ties, Theodosius abruptly retired to his family estates in the province of [[Gallaecia]] (present day [[Galicia, Spain]] and [[Norte Region, Portugal|northern Portugal]]) where he adopted to the life of a provincial aristocrat</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 364 to 375, the Roman Empire was governed by two co-emperors, the brothers [[Valentinian I]] and [[Valens]]; when Valentinian died in 375, his sons, [[Valentinian II]] and [[Gratian]], succeeded him as rulers of the [[Western Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 378, after the disastrous [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] where [[Valens]] was killed, Gratian invited Theodosius to take command of the Illyrian army</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Valens]] had no successor, Gratian's appointment of Theodosius amounted to a ''de facto'' invitation for Theodosius to become ''co-Augustus'' of the [[East Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Gratian was killed in a rebellion in 383, Theodosius appointed his own elder son, [[Arcadius]], to be his co-ruler in the East</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death in 392 of Valentinian II, whom Theodosius had supported against a variety of usurpations, Theodosius ruled as sole Emperor, appointing his younger son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] Augustus as his co-ruler of the West ([[Milan]], on 23 January 393) and by defeating the usurper [[Eugenius]] on 6 September 394, at the [[Battle of the Frigidus]] ([[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] river, modern [[Slovenia]]) he restored peace</span>
				<span class='text'>=Family==By his first wife, the probably Spanish [[Aelia Flaccilla]] Augusta, he had two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and a daughter, Aelia [[Pulcheria (daughter of Theodosius I)|Pulcheria]]; Arcadius was his heir in the East and Honorius in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Aelia Flaccilla and Pulcheria died in 385</span>
				<span class='text'>is second wife (but never declared ''Augusta'') was [[Galla (wife of Theodosius I)|Galla]], daughter of the emperor [[Valentinian I]] and his second wife [[Justina (empress)|Justina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodosius and Galla had a son Gratian, born in 388 and who died young, and a daughter Aelia [[Galla Placidia]] (392–450)</span>
				<span class='text'>Placidia was the only child who survived to adulthood and later became an Empress</span>
				<span class='text'>=Diplomatic policy with the Goths==The [[Goths]] and their allies ([[Vandals|Vandali]], [[Taifals|Taifalae]], [[Bastarnae]] and the native [[Carpians|Carpi]]) entrenched in the [[province]]s of [[Dacia]] and eastern [[Pannonia|Pannonia Inferior]] consumed Theodosius' attention</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gothic crisis was so dire that his co-Emperor Gratian relinquished control of the [[Illyria]]n provinces and retired to [[Trier]] in [[Gaul]] to let Theodosius operate without hindrance</span>
				<span class='text'>A major weakness in the Roman position after the [[Battle of Adrianople|defeat at Adrianople]] was the recruiting of [[barbarian]]s to fight against other barbarians</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to reconstruct the Roman Army of the West, Theodosius needed to find able bodied soldiers and so he turned to the most capable men readily at hand: the barbarians recently settled in the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused many difficulties in the battle against barbarians since the newly recruited fighters had little or no loyalty to Theodosius</span>

				<span class='text'>Gratian sent generals to clear the [[diocese]]s of Illyria ([[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]) of Goths, and Theodosius was able finally to enter [[Constantinople]] on  24 November 380, after two seasons in the field</span>
				<span class='text'>The final treaties with the remaining Gothic forces, signed 3 October 382, permitted large contingents of barbarians, primarily [[Thervingi]]an Goths, to settle south of the [[Danube]] frontier and largely govern themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>he Goths now settled within the Empire had, as a result of the treaties, military obligations to fight for the Romans as a national contingent, as opposed to being fully integrated into the Roman forces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, many Goths would serve in Roman legions and others, as ''[[foederati]],'' for a single campaign, while bands of Goths switching loyalties became a destabilizing factor in the internal struggles for control of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>n 390 the population of Thessalonica rioted in complaint against the presence of the local Gothic garrison</span>

				<span class='text'>]After the death of [[Gratian]] in 383, Theodosius' interests turned to the [[Western Roman Empire]], where the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] had taken all the provinces of the West except for Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>This self-proclaimed threat was hostile to Theodosius' interests, since the reigning emperor [[Valentinian II]], Maximus' enemy, was Theodosius' ally</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodosius, however, was unable to do much about Maximus due to his still inadequate military capability and he was forced to keep his attention on local matters</span>
				<span class='text'>Maximus hoped to share the Empire with Theodosius, but when Maximus began an invasion of Italy in 387, Theodosius felt compelled to take action</span>
				<span class='text'>Both sides raised large armies which included many barbarians</span>
				<span class='text'>he armies of Theodosius and Maximus fought at the [[Battle of the Save]] in 388, which saw Maximus defeated</span>

				<span class='text'>Valentinian II was a very young man, little more than a figurehead, with Arbogast as the true power behind the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>rouble arose again, after Valentinian quarreled publicly with Arbogast, and was found hanging in his room</span>
				<span class='text'>Arbogast announced that this had been a suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>Arbogast, unable to assume the role of Emperor because of his non-Roman background, elected [[Eugenius]], a former teacher of rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>Eugenius made some limited concessions to the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]; like Maximus he sought Theodosius' recognition in vain</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 393, Theodosius gave his son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] the full rank of &quot;Augustus&quot; in the West, citing Eugenius' illegitimacy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p129</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Theodosius gathered a large army, including Goths and other barbarians, and marched against Eugenius</span>
				<span class='text'>The two armies faced at the [[Battle of Frigidus]] in September 394</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p 134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The battle began on 5 September 394, with Theodosius' full frontal assault on Eugenius' forces</span>
				<span class='text'> Theodosius was repulsed on the first day, and Eugenius thought the battle to be all but over</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in Theodosius' camp, the loss of the day decreased morale</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that Theodosius was visited by two &quot;heavenly riders all in white&quot; who gave him courage</span>
				<span class='text'>The next day, the battle began again and Theodosius' forces were aided by a natural phenomenon known as the [[Bora (wind)|Bora]], which produces cyclonic winds</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bora blew directly against the forces of Eugenius and disrupted the line</span>
				<span class='text'>ugenius' camp was stormed; Arbogast committed suicide and Eugenius was captured and soon after executed</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Theodosius became sole Emperor</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Theodosius offers a [[laurel wreath]] to the victor, on the marble base of the Obelisk of [[Thutmosis III]] at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Theodosius oversaw the removal in 390 of an Egyptian [[obelisk]] from Alexandria to Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'> It is now known as the [[obelisk of Theodosius]] and still stands in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], the long [[racetrack]] that was the center of Constantinople's public life and scene of political turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>Re-erecting the monolith was a challenge for the technology that had been honed in the construction of [[siege engine]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The obelisk, still recognizably a [[Helios|solar symbol]], had been moved from [[Karnak]] to [[Alexandria]] with what is now the [[obelisks in rome|Lateran obelisk]] by [[Constantius II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Lateran obelisk was shipped to Rome soon afterwards, but the other one then spent a generation lying at the docks due to the difficulty involved in attempting to ship it to Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, the obelisk was cracked in transit</span>
				<span class='text'>The white [[marble]] base is entirely covered with [[bas-relief]]s documenting the Imperial household and the engineering feat of removing it to Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodosius and the Imperial family are separated from the nobles among the spectators in the [[Imperial box]], with a cover over them as a mark of their status</span>
				<span class='text'>The naturalism of traditional Roman art in such scenes gave way in these reliefs to [[conceptual art]]: the ''idea'' of order, decorum and respective ranking, expressed in serried ranks of faces</span>
				<span class='text'>This is seen as evidence of formal themes beginning to oust the transitory details of mundane life, celebrated in [[Hellenistic religion|Roman]] [[portrait]]ure</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Forum Tauri'' in Constantinople was renamed and redecorated as the [[Forum of Theodosius]], including a [[column of Theodosius|column]] and a [[triumphal arch]] in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>=Nicene Christianity becomes the state religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[First Council of Constantinople]] --&gt;In 325, [[Constantine I]] had facilitated the Church's bishops to convene the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], which affirmed the prevailing view that Jesus, the Son, was equal to the Father, one with the Father, and of the same substance (''[[Homoousian|homoousios]]'' in Greek)</span>
				<span class='text'>The council condemned the teachings of the heterodox theologian [[Arius]]: that the Son was a created being and inferior to God the Father</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the council's ruling, controversy continued</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of Theodosius' accession, there were still several different Church factions that promoted alternative [[Christology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Arians===While the Nicene council paved the way for the homoousian view, there remained many closer to the [[Arius|Arian]] school who attempted to bypass the Christological debate by saying that Jesus was merely like (''homoios'' in Greek) God the Father, without speaking of substance (''ousia'')</span>
				<span class='text'>These non-Nicenes were frequently labeled as [[Arians]] (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> followers of Arius) by their opponents, though not all would necessarily have identified themselves as such</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lenski, Noel, ''Failure of Empire'', University of California Press, 2002, ISBN 0-520-23332-8, pp235–237</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Emperor Valens had favored the group who used the ''homoios'' formula; this [[theology]] was prominent in much of the East and had under Constantius II gained a foothold in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodosius, on the other hand, steadfastly held to the [[Nicene Creed]] which was the interpretation that predominated in the West and was held by the important [[Church of Alexandria|Alexandrian church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Definition of orthodoxy and de-legitimation of non-orthodox Christian creeds===On 27 February 380, together with [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]], Theodosius issued the decree &quot;''Cunctos populos''&quot;, the so-called &quot;[[Edict of Thessalonica]]&quot;, recorded in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] [[:la:s:Codex Theodosianus - Liber XVI#I</span>
