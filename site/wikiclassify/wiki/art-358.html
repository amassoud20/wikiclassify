				<span class='text'>pg}}'''Luigi Pirandello''' ({{IPA-it|luˈiːdʒi piranˈdɛllo|lang}}; 28 June 1867 – 10 December 1936) was an [[Italians|Italian]] dramatist, novelist, poet and short story writer</span>
				<span class='text'>He was awarded the 1934 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for his &quot;bold and brilliant renovation of the drama and the stage&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>irandello's works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life===Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in a village with the curious name of u Càvusu (Chaos), a poor suburb of Girgenti ([[Agrigento]], a town in southern [[Sicily]])</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Stefano, belonged to a wealthy family involved in the sulphur industry, and his mother, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento</span>
				<span class='text'>Both families, the Pirandellos and the Ricci Gramittos, were ferociously anti-[[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and actively participated in the struggle for unification and democracy (&quot;[[Italian unification|Il Risorgimento]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Stefano participated in the famous [[Expedition of the Thousand]], later following [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] all the way to the [[battle of Aspromonte]], and Caterina, who had hardly reached the age of thirteen, was forced to accompany her father to [[Malta]], where he had been sent into exile by the Bourbon [[monarchy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But the open participation in the Garibaldian cause and the strong sense of idealism of those early years were quickly transformed, above all in Caterina, into an angry and bitter disappointment with the new reality created by the unification</span>
				<span class='text'>Pirandello would eventually assimilate this sense of betrayal and resentment and express it in several of his poems and in his novel ''The Old and the Young''</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also probable that this climate of disillusion inculcated in the young Luigi the sense of disproportion between ideals and reality which is recognizable in his essay on humorism (''L'Umorismo'')</span>
				<span class='text'>[[File:Pirandello - L'Umorismo, 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>jvu|thumb|page=7|''L'Umorismo'', 1908]]Pirandello received his elementary education at home but was much more fascinated by the fables and legends, somewhere between popular and magic, that his elderly servant Maria Stella used to recount to him than by anything scholastic or academic</span>
				<span class='text'>By the age of twelve he had already written his first tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>At the insistence of his father, he was registered at a technical school but eventually switched to the study of the humanities at the ''[[gymnasium (school)|ginnasio]]'', something which had always attracted him</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1880, the Pirandello family moved to [[Palermo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was here, in the capital of Sicily, that Luigi completed his high school education</span>
				<span class='text'>He also began reading omnivorously, focusing, above all, on 19th-century Italian poets such as [[Giosuè Carducci]] and [[Arturo Graf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then started writing his first poems and fell in love with his cousin Lina</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this period the first signs of serious contrast between Luigi and his father began to develop; Luigi had discovered some notes revealing the existence of Stefano's extramarital relations</span>
				<span class='text'>As a reaction to the ever-increasing distrust and disharmony that Luigi was developing toward his father, a man of a robust physique and crude manners, his attachment to his mother would continue growing to the point of profound veneration</span>
				<span class='text'>This later expressed itself, after her death, in the moving pages of the novella ''Colloqui con i personaggi'' in 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>is romantic feelings for his cousin, [[Cousin marriage|initially looked upon with disfavour]], were suddenly taken very seriously by Lina's family</span>
				<span class='text'>They demanded that Luigi abandon his studies and dedicate himself to the sulphur business so that he could immediately marry her</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886, during a vacation from school, Luigi went to visit the sulphur mines of [[Porto Empedocle]] and started working with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>This experience was essential to him and would provide the basis for such stories as ''Il Fumo'', ''Ciàula scopre la Luna'' as well as some of the descriptions and background in the novel ''The Old and the Young''</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage, which seemed imminent, was postponed</span>
				<span class='text'>irandello then registered at the [[University of Palermo]] in the departments of Law and of Letters</span>
				<span class='text'>The campus at Palermo, and above all the Department of Law, was the centre in those years of the vast movement which would eventually evolve into the [[Fasci Siciliani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with its leading ideologists: [[Rosario Garibaldi Bosco]], [[Enrico La Loggia]], [[Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida]] and [[Francesco De Luca]]</span>

				<span class='text'>tm Biografia di Luigi Pirandello], Biblioteca dei Classici italiani di Giuseppe Bonghi (Accessed 2 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;===Higher education===In 1887, having definitively chosen the Department of Letters, he moved to [[Rome]] in order to continue his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>But the encounter with the city, centre of the struggle for unification to which the families of his parents had participated with generous enthusiasm, was disappointing and nothing close to what he had expected</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;When I arrived in Rome it was raining hard, it was night time and I felt like my heart was being crushed, but then I laughed like a man in the throes of desperation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}Pirandello, who was an extremely sensitive moralist, finally had a chance to see for himself the irreducible decadence of the so-called heroes of the [[Risorgimento]] in the person of his uncle Rocco, now a greying and exhausted functionary of the prefecture who provided him with temporary lodgings in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;desperate laugh&quot;, the only manifestation of revenge for the disappointment undergone, inspired the bitter verses of his first collection of poems, ''Mal Giocondo'' (1889)</span>
				<span class='text'>But not all was negative; this first visit to Rome provided him with the opportunity to assiduously visit the many theatres of the capital: Il Nazionale, Il Valle, il Manzoni</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Oh the dramatic theatre! I will conquer it</span>
				<span class='text'>I cannot enter into one without experiencing a strange sensation, an excitement of the blood through all my veins</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Because of a conflict with a Latin professor, he was forced to leave the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and went to [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] with a letter of presentation from one of his other professors</span>
				<span class='text'>The stay in Bonn, which lasted two years, was fervid with cultural life</span>
				<span class='text'>He read the German romantics, [[Jean Paul]], [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]], [[Chamisso]], [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Goethe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He began translating the ''[[Roman Elegies]]'' of Goethe, composed the ''Elegie Boreali'' in imitation of the style of the ''Roman Elegies'', and he began to meditate on the topic of humorism by way of the works of [[Cecco Angiolieri]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 1891 he received his doctorate in Romance Philology&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bergin |first=Thomas G |editor=William D</span>

				<span class='text'>==Marriage===After a brief sojourn in Sicily, during which the planned marriage with his cousin was finally called off, he returned to Rome, where he became friends with a group of writer-journalists including Ugo Fleres, Tomaso Gnoli, Giustino Ferri and [[Luigi Capuana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Capuana encouraged Pirandello to dedicate himself to [[narrative|narrative writing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1893 he wrote his first important work, ''Marta Ajala'', which was published in 1901 as ''l'Esclusa''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1894 he published his first collection of short stories, ''Amori senza Amore''</span>
				<span class='text'>He married in 1894 as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his father's suggestion he married a shy, withdrawn girl of a good family of Agrigentine origin educated by the nuns of San Vincenzo: Antonietta Portulano</span>
				<span class='text'>he first years of matrimony brought on in him a new fervour for his studies and writings: his encounters with his friends and the discussions on art continued, more vivacious and stimulating than ever, while his family life, despite the complete incomprehension of his wife with respect to the artistic vocation of her husband,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} proceeded relatively tranquilly with the birth of two sons (Stefano and Fausto) and a daughter (Lietta)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, Pirandello intensified his collaborations with newspaper editors and other journalists in magazines such as ''La Critica'' and ''La Tavola Rotonda'' in which he published, in 1895, the first part of the ''Dialoghi tra Il Gran Me e Il Piccolo Me''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1897 he accepted an offer to teach Italian at the Istituto Superiore di Magistero di Roma, and in the magazine ''Marzocco'' he published several more pages of the ''Dialoghi''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1898, with Italo Falbo and Ugo Fleres, he founded the weekly ''Ariel'', in which he published the one-act play ''L'Epilogo'' (later changed to ''La Morsa'') and some novellas (La Scelta, Se</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The end of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th were a period of extreme productivity for Pirandello</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1900, he published in ''Marzocco'' some of the most celebrated of his novellas (''Lumie di Sicilia'', ''La Paura del Sonno''</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> and, in 1901, the collection of poems ''Zampogna''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1902 he published the first series of ''Beffe della Morte e della Vita'' and his second novel, ''Il Turno''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Family disaster===The year 1903 was fundamental to the life of Pirandello</span>
				<span class='text'>The flooding of the sulphur mines of [[Aragona]], in which his father Stefano had invested not only an enormous amount of his own capital but also Antonietta's [[dowry]], precipitated the collapse of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonietta, after opening and reading the letter announcing the catastrophe, entered into a state of semi-catatonia and underwent such a psychological shock that her mental balance remained profoundly and irremediably shaken</span>
				<span class='text'>irandello, who had initially harboured thoughts of suicide, attempted to remedy the situation as best he could by increasing the number of his lessons in both Italian and German and asking for compensation from the magazines to which he had freely given away his writings and collaborations</span>
				<span class='text'>In the magazine ''New Anthology'', directed by G</span>
				<span class='text'>Cena, meanwhile, the novel which Pirandello had been writing while in this horrible situation (watching over his mentally ill wife at night after an entire day spent at work) began appearing in episodes</span>
				<span class='text'>The title was ''Il Fu Mattia Pascal'' (''The Late Mattia Pascal'')</span>
				<span class='text'>This novel contains many autobiographical elements that have been fantastically re-elaborated</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an immediate and resounding success</span>
				<span class='text'>Translated into German in 1905, this novel paved the way to the notoriety and fame which allowed Pirandello to publish for the more important editors such as ''Treves'', with whom he published, in 1906, another collection of novellas ''Erma Bifronte''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908 he published a volume of essays entitled ''Arte e Scienza'' and the important essay ''L'Umorismo'', in which he initiated the legendary debate with [[Benedetto Croce]] that would continue with increasing bitterness and venom on both sides for many years</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1909 the first part of ''I Vecchi e I Giovani'' was published in episodes</span>
				<span class='text'>This novel retraces the history of the failure and repression of the [[Fasci Siciliani]] in the period from 1893 to 1894</span>
				<span class='text'>When the novel came out in 1913 Pirandello sent a copy of it to his parents for their fiftieth wedding anniversary along with a dedication which said that &quot;their names, Stefano and Caterina, live heroically</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, while the mother is transfigured in the novel into the otherworldly figure of Caterina Laurentano, the father, represented by the husband of Caterina, Stefano Auriti, appears only in memories and flashbacks, since, as was acutely observed by [[Leonardo Sciascia]], &quot;he died censured in a Freudian sense by his son who, in the bottom of his soul, is his enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Also in 1909, Pirandello began his collaboration with the prestigious journal ''Corriere della Sera'' in which he published the novellas ''Mondo di Carta'' (''World of Paper''), ''La Giara'', and, in 1910, ''Non è una cosa seria'' and ''Pensaci, Giacomino!'' (''Think it over, Giacomino!'') At this point Pirandello's fame as a writer was continually increasing</span>
				<span class='text'>His private life, however, was poisoned by the suspicion and obsessive jealousy of Antonietta who began turning physically violent</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1911, while the publication of novellas and short stories continued, Pirandello finished his fourth novel, ''Suo Marito'', republished posthumously (1941), and completely revised in the first four chapters, with the title ''Giustino Roncella nato Boggiòlo''</span>
				<span class='text'>During his life the author never republished this novel for reasons of discretion; within are implicit references to the writer [[Grazia Deledda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But the work which absorbed most of his energies at this time was the collection of stories ''La Vendetta del Cane'', ''Quando s'è capito il giuoco'', ''Il treno ha fischiato'', ''Filo d'aria'' and ''Berecche e la guerra''</span>
				<span class='text'>They were all published from 1913–1914 and are all now considered classics of Italian literature</span>
				<span class='text'>==First World War===As Italy entered the [[World War I|First World War]], Pirandello's son Stefano volunteered for service and was taken prisoner by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916 the actor Angelo Musco successfully recited the three-act comedy that the writer had extracted from the novella ''Pensaci, Giacomino!'' and the ''pastoral'' comedy ''[[Liolà]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1917 the collection of novellas ''E domani Lunedì'' (''And Tomorrow, Monday</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>') was published, but the year was mostly marked by important theatrical representations: ''Così è (se vi pare)'' (''Right you are (if you think so)''), ''A birrita cu' i ciancianeddi'' and ''Il Piacere dell'onestà'' (''The Pleasure Of Honesty'')</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, ''Ma non è una cosa seria'' (''But It's Nothing Serious'') and ''[[Il Gioco delle parti]]'' (''The Game of Roles'') were all produced on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Pirandello's son Stefano returned home when the war ended</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Pirandello</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Bust of Pirandello in a public park in Palermo]]In 1919 Pirandello had his wife placed in an asylum</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The separation from his wife, toward whom, despite her morbid jealousies and hallucinations, he continued to feel a very strong attraction, caused great suffering for Pirandello who, even as late as 1924, believed he could still properly care for her at home</span>
				<span class='text'>She never left the asylum</span>
				<span class='text'>920 was the year of comedies such as ''Tutto per bene'', ''Come prima meglio di prima'', and ''La Signora Morli''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1921, the ''Compagnia di Dario Niccomedi'' staged, at the Valle di Roma, the play, ''Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore'', ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a clamorous failure</span>
				<span class='text'>The public divided into supporters and adversaries, the latter of whom shouted, &quot;Asylum, Asylum!&quot; The author, who was present at the performance with his daughter Lietta, left through a side exit to avoid the crowd of enemies</span>
				<span class='text'>The same drama, however, was a great success when presented in [[Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1922 in Milan, ''Enrico IV'' was performed for the first time and was acclaimed universally as a success</span>
				<span class='text'>Pirandello's international reputation was developing as well</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Sei personaggi'' was performed in EnglandŠÓŃ in London and New York</span>
				<span class='text'>==Italy under the Fascists ===In 1925, Pirandello, with the help of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], assumed the artistic direction and ownership of the [[Teatro d'Arte di Roma]], founded by the Gruppo degli Undici</span>
				<span class='text'>He described himself as &quot;a Fascist because I am Italian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For his devotion to Mussolini, the satirical magazine ''[[Il Becco Giallo]]'' used to call him ''P</span>

				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt;His play, ''The Giants of the Mountain'', has been interpreted as evidence of his realization that the fascists were hostile to culture; yet, during a later appearance in New York, Pirandello distributed a statement announcing his support of Italy's annexation of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave his Nobel Prize medal to the Fascist government to be melted down for the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Abyssinia Campaign]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mussolini's support brought him international fame and a worldwide tour, introducing his work to London, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Germany, Argentina, and Brazil</span>
