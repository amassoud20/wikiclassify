				<span class='text'>n 1928 Johnson met with architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], who was at the time designing the [[Barcelona Pavilion|German Pavilion]] for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The meeting was a revelation for Johnson and formed the basis for a lifelong relationship of both collaboration and competition</span>

				<span class='text'>The show was profoundly influential and is seen as the introduction of [[modern architecture]] to the American public</span>
				<span class='text'>It introduced such pivotal architects as [[Le Corbusier]], [[Walter Gropius]], and [[Mies van der Rohe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The exhibition was also notable for a controversy: architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] withdrew his entries in pique that he was not more prominently featured</span>
				<span class='text'>s critic Peter Blake has stated, the importance of this show in shaping [[American architecture]] in the century &quot;cannot be overstated</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} In the book accompanying the show, coauthored with Hitchcock, Johnson argued that the new modern style maintained three formal principles: 1</span>
				<span class='text'>an emphasis on architectural volume over mass (planes rather than solidity) 2</span>
				<span class='text'>a rejection of symmetry and 3</span>
				<span class='text'>rejection of applied decoration</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Glass House]] (1949) that he designed as his own residence in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] was a profoundly influential work, but &quot;universally viewed as having been derived from&quot; the [[Farnsworth House]], according to Alice T</span>

				<span class='text'>Johnson curated an exhibit of [[Mies van der Rohe]] work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1947, featuring a model of the glass Farnsworth House</span>

				<span class='text'>The building is an [[essay]] in minimal structure, geometry, proportion, and the effects of transparency and reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>he house sits at the edge of a crest on Johnson's estate overlooking a pond</span>
				<span class='text'>The building's sides are glass and charcoal-painted steel; the floor, of brick, is not flush with the ground but sits 10&amp;nbsp;inches above</span>
				<span class='text'>The interior is an open space divided by low walnut cabinets; a brick cylinder contains the bathroom and is the only object to reach floor to ceiling</span>
				<span class='text'>ohnson continued to build structures on his estate as architectural essays</span>
				<span class='text'>Offset obliquely fifty feet from the Glass House is a guest house, echoing the proportions of the Glass House and completely enclosed in brick (except for three large circular windows at the rear, set in wooden frames, 5 feet in diameter, which reveal the interior of the building that was originally designed with a window in each of three rooms, two guest bedrooms at each end and a study in the middle)</span>
				<span class='text'>It now contains a bathroom, library, and single bedroom with a vaulted ceiling and shag carpet</span>
				<span class='text'>It was built at the same time as the Glass House and can be seen as its formal counterpart</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson stated that he deliberately designed it to be less than perfectly comfortable, as &quot;guests are like fish, they should only last three days at most&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ater, Johnson added a painting gallery with an innovative viewing mechanism of rotating walls to hold paintings (influenced by the Hogarth displays at Sir John Soane's house), followed by a sky-lit sculpture gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>The last structures Johnson built on the estate were a library and a reception building, the latter, red and black in color and of curving walls</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson viewed the ensemble of one-room buildings as a total work of art, claiming that it was his best and only &quot;landscape project</span>

				<span class='text'>==The Seagram Building==={{main|Seagram Building}}After completing several houses in the idiom of Mies and Breuer, Johnson joined Mies van der Rohe as the New York associate architect for the 39-story [[Seagram Building]] (1956)</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson was pivotal in steering the commission towards Mies by working with [[Phyllis Lambert]], the daughter of the CEO of [[Seagram]]</span>

				<span class='text'>ompleting the Seagram Building with Mies also decisively marked a shift in Johnson's career</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|The [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] [[Sony Building (New York)|AT&amp;T Building (1984)]], now the Sony Building]]Although startling when constructed, the glass and steel tower (indeed many idioms of the modern movement) had by the 1960s become commonplace the world over</span>
				<span class='text'>He eventually rejected much of the metallic appearance of earlier International Style buildings, and began designing spectacular, crystalline structures uniformly sheathed in glass</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these became instant icons, such as [[PPG Place]] in [[Pittsburgh]] and the [[Crystal Cathedral]] in [[Garden Grove, California]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The [[Crystal Cathedral]], [[Garden Grove, California]] in 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>]Johnson's architectural work is a balancing act between two dominant trends in post-war American art: the more &quot;serious&quot; movement of [[Minimalism]], and the more populist movement of [[Pop Art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His best work has aspects of both movements</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson's personal art collection reflected this dichotomy, as he introduced artists such as [[Mark Rothko]] to the Museum of Modern Art as well as [[Andy Warhol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Straddling between these two camps, his work was seen by purists of either side as always too contaminated or influenced by the other</span>
				<span class='text'>With his thick, round-framed glasses, Johnson was the most recognizable figure in American architecture for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>As an art collector Johnson's eclectic eye supported [[avant-garde]] movements and young artists often before they became widely known</span>
				<span class='text'>His collection of American art was strong in [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Color Field]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and [[Neo-Expressionism]] and he often donated important works from his collection to institutions like [[MoMA]], and other important private museums and University collections like the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[Sheldon Museum of Art]] and the [[Iris &amp; B</span>
				<span class='text'>Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts]] at [[Stanford University]] among many others</span>
				<span class='text'>rom 1967 to 1991 Johnson collaborated with [[John Burgee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was by far Johnson's most productive period — certainly by the measure of scale — he became known at this time as builder of iconic office towers, including [[Minneapolis]]'s [[IDS Tower]] opened 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>That building's distinctive stepbacks (called &quot;zogs&quot; by the architect) created an appearance that has since become one of Minneapolis's trademarks and the crown jewel of its [[skyline]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Morris filmed at both sites over the course of several months, among otherlocations including The Four Seasons Restaurant, the Seagram Building, Mies van der Roheʼs controversial [[860–880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]], and Chicagoʼs [[Newberry Library]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Morris utilized The Four Seasons, a place that Philip Johnson practically used as his personal office, as the meeting point between the two architects</span>
				<span class='text'>The restaurant remains a site of projection and desire – active as a site of negotiation and display</span>
				<span class='text'>Morrisʼs film is both a record of preservation of two structures and a document of power plays that left a mark in the pragmatic idealism of the late modern period</span>
