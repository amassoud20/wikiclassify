				<span class='text'>He had hoped to represent the Netherlands in the United Nations</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated in 1948 with the highest possible marks in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology</span>
				<span class='text'>So his teachers and parents counseled him to seek a career in the sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to join the [[University of Leiden]], to study mathematics and physics during the first years, and [[theoretical physics]] later on</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dijkstra_bio&quot;/&gt;In the early 1950s, [[electronic computers]] were a novelty</span>
				<span class='text'>Dijkstra stumbled on his career quite by accident</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had seen an advertisement for a three-week course in programming for the electronic computer [[EDSAC]], to be given at [[Cambridge University]], and he advised his son to attend the course</span>
				<span class='text'>Dijkstra felt that computers might become an important tool for theoretical physicists, and he decided to attend this course in September 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>When he asked his supervisor, Professor dr</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Haantjes, for a letter of recommendation, it turned out that Professor Haantjes knew [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], the director of the Computation Department at the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], and he knew that van Wijngaarden had taken the same course in 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>Professor Haantjes phoned van Wijngaarden who invited Dijkstra to visit the Mathematical Center and wrote the letter of recommendation</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Wijngaarden also offered Dijkstra a job, which he accepted, becoming officially the Netherlands' first &quot;programmer&quot; in March 1952</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dijkstra_bio&quot;/&gt;In 1956 he graduated from the [[Leiden University]] in mathematics and theoretical physics</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959 he received his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] for his thesis entitled 'Communication with an Automatic Computer', devoted to a description of the assembly language designed for the first commercial computer developed in the Netherlands, the X1</span>
				<span class='text'>It also dealt with the concept of an interrupt, a novelty at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>His PhD thesis supervisor was van Wijngaarden</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Apt, Krzysztof R</span>
				<span class='text'>2002&quot;/&gt;For some time Dijkstra remained committed to physics, working on it in [[Leiden]] three days out of each week</span>

				<span class='text'>Some widely used modern programming languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] lack the GOTO statement, though most provide some means of breaking out of a selection, or either [[Break statement|breaking]] out of or [[Control flow#Continuation with next iteration|moving]] on to the next step of an iteration</span>

				<span class='text'>The job was actually beyond the [[electronic technology]] of the day, and, as a result, the question of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition became in the early days the all-overriding concern</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the topic became – primarily in the USA – prematurely known as '[[computer science]]' – which, actually, is like referring to [[surgery]] as 'knife science' – and it was firmly implanted in people's minds that [[computing science]] is about machines and their peripheral equipment</span>

				<span class='text'>The precious gift that this Turing Award acknowledges is Dijkstra's style: his approach to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; his eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]]; and his illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of [[Software design|program design]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He would lay the foundations that would establish computing as a rigorous scientific discipline; and in his research and in his teaching and in his writing, he would pursue perfection to the exclusion of all other concerns</span>
