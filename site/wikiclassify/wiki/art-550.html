				<span class='text'>His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite</span>
				<span class='text'>Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: &quot;He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times</span>

				<span class='text'>Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: &quot;I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|545}}His early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a low-key conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although his style was well rehearsed</span>
				<span class='text'>He acted &quot;normal&quot;, dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage &quot;personality&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>And he did not improvise: &quot;I put very little premium on improvisation,&quot; he told [[Studs Terkel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor which made them funnier: &quot;I don't think my family liked me</span>
				<span class='text'>They put a live teddy bear in my crib</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|533}}The subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or even socially relevant</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>And although he was described as a &quot;classic nebbish&quot;, he did not tell Jewish jokes</span>
				<span class='text'>Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: &quot;He just styled himself completely after her,&quot; he said</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals</span>
				<span class='text'>elevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's monologue: &quot;I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: &quot;The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised</span>
				<span class='text'>This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''New York Times''' [[Arthur Gelb]] would describe Allen's nebbish quality as being [[Charlie Chaplin|&quot;Chaplinesque&quot;]] and &quot;refreshing&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He subsequently released three LP albums of live nightclub recordings: the self-titled ''Woody Allen'' (1964), ''Volume 2'' (1965), and ''The Third Woody Allen Album'' (1968) recorded at a fund-raiser for [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s presidential run</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1989, Allen teamed with directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] to make ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen's short, ''[[New York Stories|Oedipus Wrecks]]'', is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother</span>
				<span class='text'>His short pleased critics, but ''New York Stories'' bombed at the box office</span>
				<span class='text'>==1990s===His 1991 film ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' is a black-and-white homage to the [[German Expressionism|German expressionists]] and features the music of [[Kurt Weill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen then made his critically acclaimed drama ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for [[Judy Davis]] and Best Original Screenplay for Allen</span>
				<span class='text'>His film ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996)</span>
				<span class='text'>The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress)</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire towards the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998)</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this decade Allen also starred in the TV movie ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]]</span>
				<span class='text'>llen made one sitcom &quot;appearance&quot; via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, &quot;My Dinner with Woody&quot; which paid tribute to several of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen provided the lead voice in the 1998 animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which featured many actors he had worked with and Allen's character was similar to his earlier neurotic roles</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Small Time Crooks'' was Allen's first film with the [[DreamWorks]] studio and represented a change in direction: Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (with a budget of $26 million)</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Hollywood Ending]]'', ''[[Anything Else]]'', and ''[[Melinda and Melinda]]'' were given &quot;rotten&quot; ratings from film-review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and each earned less than $4 million domestically</span>
