				<span class='text'>Communist partisans in [[Yugoslavia]] had a much more practical role, helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies, but communication between them and the Albanians was limited and letters would often arrive late, sometimes well after a plan had been agreed upon by the National Liberation Army without consultation from the Yugoslav partisans</span>
				<span class='text'>ithin Albania difficulties in communications faced groups of partisans fighting the fascist invaders, throughout the war, repeated attempts were made to remedy this</span>
				<span class='text'> In August 1943, a secret meeting was held in [[Mukje]] between the anti-communist [[Balli Kombëtar]] (National Front) and the Communist Party of Albania</span>
				<span class='text'> The result of this was an [[Mukje Agreement|agreement]] to:#Unite in a single struggle against the fascist invader</span>

				<span class='text'> Be it resolved that the populations of Kosovo and Camëria will themselves decide   their future in accordance with their wishes</span>
				<span class='text'>Unite with any political group, whatever their beliefs, in a common military effort against the fascist invaders</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Communist Party of Albania will not collaborate with any group of the National Front that continues to maintain contacts with the fascist invaders</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communist Party of Albania will unite with any group that used to have contacts with the fascist invaders, but has now terminated those contacts and is willing to now fight against the fascist invaders, provided those groups have not committed any crimes against the people</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Disagreement with Yugoslav communists ===A problem developed when the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Communists disagreed with the goal of a Greater Albania and asked the Communists in Albania to withdraw their agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Hoxha, [[Josip Broz Tito]] had agreed that &quot;Kosovo was Albanian&quot; but that [[Serbs|Serbian]] opposition made transfer an unwise option</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After the Albanian Communists repudiated the Greater Albania agreement, the Balli Kombëtar condemned the Communists, who in turn accused the Balli Kombëtar of siding with the Italians</span>
				<span class='text'>The Balli Kombëtar, however, lacked support from the people</span>
				<span class='text'>After judging the Communists as an immediate threat, the Balli Kombëtar sided with the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], fatally damaging its image among those fighting the Fascists</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Kombëtar and took center stage in the fight for liberation</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|250px|[[Miladin Popović]] and Enver Hoxha]]At this point, relations with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] had begun to change</span>
				<span class='text'>The roots of the change began on 20 October 1944 at the Second Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Albania</span>
				<span class='text'>The Session considered the problems that the post-independence Albanian government would face</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Yugoslav delegation led by Velimir Stoinić accused the party of &quot;sectarianism and opportunism&quot; and blamed Hoxha for these errors</span>
				<span class='text'>He also stressed the view that the Yugoslav Communist partisans spearheaded the Albanian partisan movement</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Anti-Yugoslav members of the Albanian Communist Party had begun to think that this was a plot by Tito who intended to destabilize the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Koçi Xoxe]], [[Sejfulla Malëshova]] and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion</span>
				<span class='text'>Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946</span>
				<span class='text'>In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>19&quot; /&gt;The first issue was that the [[Albanian lek]] became revalued in terms of the [[Yugoslav dinar]] as a [[customs union]] was formed and Albania's economic plan was decided more by Yugoslavia</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Albania didn't need to create its national industry, but should limit her production to agricultural and mineral raw materials, which were to be sent for industrial processing to Yugoslavia</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, they wanted the Albanian economy to be a mere appendage of the Yugoslav economy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct:{{Quote| text = We [Albania] were expected to produce for the Yugoslavs all the raw materials which they needed</span>
				<span class='text'>These raw materials were to be exported to the metropolitan Yugoslavia to be processed there in Yugoslav factories</span>
				<span class='text'>The same applied to the production of cotton and other industrial crops, as well as oil, bitumen, asphalt, chrome, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>Yugoslavia would supply its 'colony', Albania, with exorbitantly priced consumer goods, including even items such as needles and thread, and would provide us with petrol and oil, as well as glass for the lamps in which we burn the fuel extracted from our subsoil, processed in Yugoslavia and sold to us at high prices&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The aim of the Yugoslavs was, therefore, to prevent our country from developing either its industry or its working class, and to make it forever dependent on Yugoslavia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of talking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line</span>
				<span class='text'>When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval</span>

				<span class='text'>He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia, and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a Yugoslav counterpart</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined</span>
				<span class='text'>When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha's support base grew stronger</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void</span>
				<span class='text'>Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949 he was executed by a firing squad</span>

				<span class='text'>467</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Relations with the Soviet Union ===After the break with Yugoslavia, Hoxha aligned himself with the Soviet Union, for which he had a great admiration</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1948 to 1960, $200 million in Soviet aid was given to Albania for technical and infrastructural expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>Albania was admitted to the [[Comecon]] on 22 February 1949 and remained important both as a way to pressure Yugoslavia and to serve as a pro-Soviet force in the [[Adriatic Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A submarine base was built on the island of [[Sazan]] near [[Vlorë]], posing a possible threat to the [[United States Sixth Fleet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Relations remained close until the death of Stalin on 5 March 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>His death was met with national mourning in Albania</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha assembled the entire population in the capital's largest square featuring a statue of Stalin, requested that they kneel, and made them take a two-thousand word oath of &quot;eternal fidelity&quot; and &quot;gratitude&quot; to their &quot;beloved father&quot; and &quot;great liberator&quot; to whom the people owed &quot;everything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' 179 (16 June 1956): 110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Stalin's successor, aid was reduced and Albania was encouraged to adopt Khrushchev's specialization policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Under this policy, Albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] nations while these nations would be developing specific resource outputs of their own, which would in theory strengthen the Warsaw Pact by greatly reducing the lack of certain resources that many of the nations faced</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this also meant that Albanian industrial development, which was stressed heavily by Hoxha, would have to be significantly reduced</span>

				<span class='text'>Khrushchev also began making references to [[Palmiro Togliatti]]'s [[polycentrism]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended</span>
				<span class='text'>Yugoslavia began asking for Hoxha to rehabilitate the image of [[Koçi Xoxe]], which Hoxha steadfastly rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1956 at the [[Twentieth Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]], Khrushchev condemned the [[cult of personality]] that had been built up around [[Joseph Stalin]] and also accused him of many grave mistakes</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev then announced the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]], which angered Hoxha greatly</span>
				<span class='text'>The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies, led by Hoxha's wife [[Nexhmije Hoxha|Nexhmije]], quoted [[Vladimir Lenin]]: &quot;The fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a Communist party is [[proletarian internationalism]]; not peaceful coexistence</span>

				<span class='text'>nity within the [[Albanian Party of Labour]] began to decline as well, with a special delegate meeting held in Tirana in April 1956, composed of 450 delegates and having unexpected results</span>
				<span class='text'>The delegates &quot;criticized the conditions in the party, the negative attitude toward the masses, the absence of party and socialist democracy, the economic policy of the leadership, etc</span>

				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt;==== Movement towards China and Maoism ====In 1956, Hoxha called for a [[conflict resolution|resolution]] which would uphold the current leadership of the Party</span>
				<span class='text'>The resolution was accepted, and all of the delegates who had spoken out were expelled from the party and imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha stated that this was yet another of many attempts to overthrow the leadership of Albania which had been organized by Yugoslavia</span>
				<span class='text'>This incident further consolidated Hoxha's power, effectively making Khrushchev-esque reforms nearly impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year, Hoxha traveled to the People's Republic of China, then enduring the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], and personally met with [[Mao Zedong]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Relations with China improved, as evidenced by Chinese aid to Albania being 4</span>
				<span class='text'>% in 1955 before the visit, and rising to 21</span>
				<span class='text'>% in 1957</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In an effort to keep Albania in the Soviet sphere, increased aid was given but the Albanian leadership continued to move closer towards China</span>
				<span class='text'>Relations with the Soviet Union remained at the same level until 1960, when Khrushchev met with [[Sophocles Venizelos]], a left-wing Greek politician</span>
				<span class='text'>Khrushchev sympathized with the concept of an autonomous Greek [[North Epirus]] and hoped to use Greek claims to keep the Albanian leadership in line with Soviet interests</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha reacted by only sending Hysni Kapo, a member of the Albanian Political Bureau, to the Third Congress of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in [[Bucharest]], an event that heads of state were normally expected to attend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>46-47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate in the course of the meeting, Khrushchev said:{{Quote| text = Especially shameless was the behavior of that agent of Mao Zedong, Enver Hoxha</span>

				<span class='text'>After his speech, Comrade [[Dolores Ibárruri]] [a Spanish Communist], an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it</span>

				<span class='text'>A [[hardline]] policy was adopted and the Soviets reduced aid shipments, specifically grain, at a time when Albania needed them due to flood-induced [[famine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In July 1960, a plot to overthrow the government was discovered</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to be organized by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral [[Teme Sejko]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, two pro-Soviet members of the Party, Liri Belishova and Koço Tashko, were expelled, with a humorous incident involving Tashko pronouncing ''[[Wiktionary:точка#Russian|tochka]]'' (Russian for &quot;[[full stop]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Albania Challenges Khrushchev Revisionism'' (New York: Gamma Publishing, 1976), 109–110n</span>
				<span class='text'>Enver Hoxha stated: &quot;This ridiculous action of Koço Tashko made it quite evident that the text of his contribution had been dictated by an official of the Soviet Embassy and during the translation he had become confused, failing to distinguish between the text and the punctuation marks</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;In August, the Party's Central Committee sent a letter of protest to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating its displeasure at having an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana</span>
				<span class='text'>The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations attended in Albania</span>
				<span class='text'>During the congress, the Soviet Union was condemned while China was praised</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Mehmet Shehu]] stated that while many members of the Party were accused of [[tyranny]], this was a baseless charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists</span>
				<span class='text'>he Soviet Union retaliated by threatening &quot;dire consequences&quot; if the condemnations were not retracted</span>
				<span class='text'>Days later, Khrushchev and Antonin Novotny, President of [[Czechoslovakia]] (which was Albania's largest source of aid besides the Soviets), threatened to cut off economic aid</span>
				<span class='text'>In March, Albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the Warsaw Pact nations (Albania had been one of its founding members in 1955) and in April all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>In May nearly all Soviet troops on the Oricum Sea base were withdrawn, leaving the Albanians with 4 submarines and other military equipment</span>
				<span class='text'>n 7 November 1961, Hoxha made a speech in which he called Khrushchev a &quot;revisionist, an anti-Marxist and a defeatist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Hoxha portrayed Stalin as the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union and began to stress Albania's independence</span>

				<span class='text'>Albania was unofficially excluded (by not being invited) from both the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]In Albania's Third Five Year Plan, China promised a loan of $125&amp;nbsp;million to build twenty-five chemical, electrical and metallurgical plants called for under the Plan</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the nation had a difficult transition period, because Chinese technicians were of a lower quality than Soviet ones and the distance between the two nations, plus the poor relations Albania had with its neighbors, further complicated matters</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Yugoslavia or the USSR, China had the least influence economically on Albania during Hoxha's leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>The previous fifteen years (1946–1961) had at least 50% of the economy under foreign commerce</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the time the 1976 Constitution prohibited foreign debt, aid and investments, Albania had basically become self-sufficient although it was lacking in modern technology</span>
				<span class='text'>Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with [[Marxism-Leninism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mao condemned [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s alleged [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] and was also critical of Yugoslavia</span>
				<span class='text'>Aid given from China was interest-free and did not have to be repaid until Albania could afford to do so</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;China never intervened in what Albania's economic output should be, and Chinese technicians worked for the same wages as Albanian workers, unlike Soviet technicians who sometimes made more than three times the pay of Hoxha</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hamm, 45&quot; /&gt; Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers and read on Chinese radio</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, Albania led the movement [[China and the United Nations|to give the People's Republic of China a seat]] in the UN, an effort made successful in 1971 and thus replacing the Republic of China's seat</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During this period, Albania became the second largest producer of chromium in the world, which was considered an important export for Albania</span>
				<span class='text'>Strategically, the [[Adriatic Sea]] was also attractive to China, and the Chinese leadership had hoped to gain more allies in Eastern Europe with the help of Albania, although this failed</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zhou Enlai]] visited Albania in January 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>On 9 January, &quot;The 1964 Sino-Albanian Joint Statement&quot; was signed in Tirana</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Biberaj, 48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The statement said of relations between socialist countries:{{Quote| text = Both [Albania and China] hold that the relations between socialist countries are international relations of a new type</span>
				<span class='text'>Relations between socialist countries, big or small, economically more developed or less developed, must be based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial sovereignty and independence, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and must also be based on the principles of mutual assistance in accordance with proletarian internationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>It is necessary to oppose great-nation chauvinism and national egoism in relations between socialist countries</span>
				<span class='text'>It is absolutely impermissible to impose the will of one country upon another, or to impair the independence, sovereignty and interests of the people, of a fraternal country on the pretext of 'aid' or 'international division of labour</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sino-Albanian Joint Statement,&quot; ''Peking Review'' (17 January 1964) 17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Like Albania, China defended the &quot;purity&quot; of Marxism by attacking both &quot;US [[imperialism]]&quot; as well as &quot;Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism&quot;, both equally as part of a &quot;dual adversary&quot; theory</span>

				<span class='text'>68&quot;&gt;O'Donnell, p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslavia was viewed as a &quot;special detachment of U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>imperialism&quot; and a &quot;saboteur against world revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>68&quot; /&gt; These views however began to change in China, which was one of the major issues Albania had with the alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Biberaj, 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Also unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and was characterized by an informal relationship conducted on an ''ad hoc'' basis</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 which claimed that Albania was the only [[Marxist-Leninist]] state in Europe and that &quot;an attack on Albania will have to reckon with great People's China</span>
				<span class='text'>If the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing lies ahead for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Hoxha stated that &quot;You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together</span>
				<span class='text'>They will fight together and they will win together</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biberaj, 58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==== Shift in Chinese foreign policy after the Cultural Revolution ====China entered into a four-year period of relative diplomatic isolation following the [[Cultural Revolution]] and at this point relations between China and Albania reached their zenith</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 August 1968, the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] was condemned by Albania, as was the [[Brezhnev doctrine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Albania then officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact on 5 September</span>
				<span class='text'>Relations with China began to deteriorate on 15 July 1971, when United States President [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to visit China to meet with [[Zhou Enlai]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha felt betrayed and the government was in a state of shock</span>
				<span class='text'>On 6 August a letter was sent from the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, calling Nixon a &quot;frenzied anti-Communist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The letter stated:{{Quote| text = We trust you will understand the reason for the delay in our reply</span>
				<span class='text'>This was because your decision came as a surprise to us and was taken without any preliminary consultation between us on this question, so that we would be able to express and thrash out our opinions</span>
				<span class='text'>This, we think, could have been useful, because preliminary consultations, between close friends, determined co-fighters against imperialism and revisionism, are useful and necessary, and especially so, when steps which, in our opinion, have a major international effect and repercussion are taken</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Considering the Communist Party of China as a sister party and our closest co-fighter, we have never hidden our views from it</span>
				<span class='text'>That is why on this major problem which you put before us, we inform you that we consider your decision to receive Nixon in Beijing as incorrect and undesirable, and we do not approve or support it</span>
				<span class='text'>It will also be our opinion that Nixon's announced visit to China will not be understood or approved of by the peoples, the revolutionaries and the communists of different countries</span>

				<span class='text'>4 (Tirana: 8 Nëntori Publishing House, 1982), 666–667, 668</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}The result was a 1971 message from the Chinese leadership stating that Albania could not depend on an indefinite flow of further Chinese aid and in 1972 Albania was advised to &quot;curb its expectations about further Chinese contributions to its economic development</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biberaj, 90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By 1973, Hoxha wrote in his diary ''Reflections on China'' that the Chinese leaders:{{Quote| text =</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;have cut off their contacts with us, and the contacts which they maintain are merely formal diplomatic ones</span>
				<span class='text'>Albania is no longer the 'faithful, special friend'</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;They are maintaining the economic agreements though with delays, but it is quite obvious that their 'initial ardor' has died</span>

				<span class='text'>2: (Toronto: Norman Bethune Institute, 1979), 41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In response, trade with COMECON (although trade with the Soviet Union was still blocked) and Yugoslavia grew</span>
				<span class='text'>Trade with Third World nations was $0</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million in 1973, but $8</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million in 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>Trade rose from 0</span>
				<span class='text'>% to 1</span>
				<span class='text'>%</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Biberaj, 98</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following Mao's death on 9 September 1976, Hoxha (who attended Mao's funeral in Beijing) remained optimistic about Sino-Albanian relations, but in August 1977, [[Hua Guofeng]], the new leader of China, stated that Mao's [[Three Worlds Theory]] would become official foreign policy</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha viewed this as a way for China to justify having the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as the &quot;secondary enemy&quot; while viewing the Soviet Union as the main one, thus allowing China to trade with the U</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;the Chinese plan of the 'third world' is a major diabolical plan, with the aim that China should become another superpower, precisely by placing itself at the head of the 'third world' and 'non-aligned world</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From 30 August to 7 September 1977, Tito visited Beijing and was welcomed by the Chinese leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point, the Albanian Party of Labour had declared that China was now a revisionist state akin to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and that Albania was the only Marxist–Leninist state on earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha stated:{{Quote| text = The Chinese leaders are acting like the leaders of a 'great state</span>
				<span class='text'> They think, 'The Albanians fell out with the Soviet Union because they had us, and if they fall with us, too, they will go back to the Soviets,' therefore they say, 'Either with us or the Soviets, it is all the same, the Albanians are done for</span>

				<span class='text'>In the Ottoman Empire, Muslims were viewed as Turks, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] were viewed as Greeks, and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] were viewed as Latins</span>
				<span class='text'>Hoxha believed this was a serious issue, feeling that it both fueled Greek separatists in southern Albania and that it also divided the nation in general</span>
				<span class='text'>The Agrarian Reform Law of 1945 confiscated much of the church's property in the country</span>
