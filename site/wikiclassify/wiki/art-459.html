				<span class='text'>=Personal life==Born in [[Niles, Michigan]], Ring Lardner was the son of wealthy parents, Henry and Lena Phillips Lardner</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the youngest of nine children</span>
				<span class='text'> Lardner's name came from a [[cousin]] of the same name</span>
				<span class='text'>The cousin had been named by Lardner's uncle, Rear Admiral [[James L</span>
				<span class='text'>Lardner]], who had decided to name his son after a friend, Rear Admiral [[Cadwalader Ringgold]], who was from a distinguished [[military]] family</span>
				<span class='text'>Lardner never liked his given name and abbreviated it to Ring, naming one of his sons [[Ring Lardner, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>Ring Jr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ardner was married to Ellis Abbott of [[Goshen, Indiana]] during 1911</span>
				<span class='text'>They had four sons, [[John Lardner (sports writer)|John]], James, Ring Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> and David</span>

				<span class='text'> Soon afterward, he accepted a job with the rival newspaper ''South Bend Times'', the first of many professional switches</span>
				<span class='text'> During 1907, he relocated to [[Chicago]], where he gained a job with the [[Chicago Inter Ocean|''Inter-Ocean'']], but within a year, he switched to work for to the ''[[Chicago Examiner]]'', then the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Louis, Missouri|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis]], writing the humorous baseball column ''Pullman Pastimes'' for Taylor Spink and the ''[[Sporting News]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of this work was the basis for his book ''You Know Me Al''</span>
				<span class='text'> Within three months, he was an employee of the ''[[Boston American]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1913, Lardner returned to the ''Chicago Tribune'', which became the home newspaper for his syndicated column ''In the Wake of the News'' (started by [[Hugh Keough]], who had died during 1912)</span>
				<span class='text'>The column appeared in more than 100 newspapers, and is still published in the ''Tribune''</span>
				<span class='text'>Lardner's Tribune and syndicated writing was not exclusively sports related:his dispatches from/near the World War One front were collected in the book ''My Four Weeks in France'', and his immersive coverage of the 1920 Democratic Convention resulted in Lardner receiving 0</span>
				<span class='text'> votes on the 23rd ballot</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1916, Lardner published his first successful book, ''[[You Know Me Al]]'', an [[epistolary novel]] written in the form of letters by &quot;Jack Keefe&quot;, a bush-league [[baseball]] player, to a friend back home</span>
				<span class='text'> The letters made much use of the fictional author's idiosyncratic [[vernacular]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It had initially been published as six separate but interrelated [[short story|short stories]] in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', causing some to classify the book as a [[short story collection|collection of stories]], others as a [[novel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Like most of Lardner's stories, ''You Know Me Al'' employs [[satire]], in this case to show the stupidity and avarice of a certain type of athlete</span>
				<span class='text'>The journalist [[Andrew Ferguson (journalist)|Andrew Ferguson]] wrote that &quot;Ring Lardner thought of himself as primarily a sports columnist whose stuff wasn't destined to last, and he held to that absurd belief even after his first masterpiece, ''You Know Me Al'', was published in 1916 and earned the awed appreciation of [[Virginia Woolf]], among other very serious, unfunny people</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Ferguson termed the book one of the top five pieces of American humor writing</span>

				<span class='text'>This was the [[Black Sox scandal]] when the [[Chicago White Sox]] sold out the [[World Series]] to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ring was exceptionally close to the White Sox and felt he was betrayed by the team</span>
				<span class='text'>After the scandal, Ring always wrote about sports as if there were some kink to the outcome</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Lardner Dynasty - Ring&quot;/&gt; Lardner's last fictional baseball writing was collected in the book ''Lose with a Smile'' (1933)</span>
				<span class='text'>ardner later published such stories as &quot;Haircut&quot;, &quot;Some Like Them Cold&quot;, &quot;The Golden Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;[[Alibi Ike]]&quot;, and &quot;A Day with Conrad Green&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also continued to write follow-up stories to ''You Know Me Al'', with the protagonist of that book, the headstrong but gullible Jack Keefe, experiencing various ups and downs in his major league career and in his personal life</span>
				<span class='text'>Private Keefe's [[World War I]] training camp letters home to his friend Al were collected in the book ''Treat 'Em Rough: Letters From Jack the Kaiser Killer&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequel, &quot;The Real Dope&quot; followed Keefe overseas to the trenches in France</span>
				<span class='text'>ardner was a dedicated composer and lyricist: both his first - Zanzibar (1903)- and last - June Moon (1920)- published stage works included several Lardner tunes</span>
				<span class='text'>Lardner wrote at least one recorded song for [[Bert Williams]], and provided the lyrics for the song &quot;That Old Quartet&quot; (1913) by [[Nathaniel D</span>
				<span class='text'>Mann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other collaborators of note(s) included Aubrey Stauffer, [[Jerome Kern]], and [[Vincent Youmans]] -with whom he toiled on the Ziegfeld Astaires musical, Smiles (1930)</span>
				<span class='text'>Lardner also had a lifelong fascination with the theatre, although his only Broadway three-act successes were the thrice-filmed ''Elmer The Great'', co-written with [[George M</span>
				<span class='text'>Cohan]], and ''[[June Moon]]'', a [[comedy]] authored with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] veteran [[George S</span>
				<span class='text'>Kaufman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lardner also wrote skits fot the Ziegfeld Follies</span>
				<span class='text'>and a series of brief nonsense plays that ridiculed the conventions of the theatre using zany humor and outrageous, impossible stage directions, such as &quot;The curtain is lowered for seven days to denote the lapse of a week</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Lardner was a good friend of [[F</span>
				<span class='text'>Scott Fitzgerald]] and other authors of the [[Jazz Age]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His books were published by [[Maxwell Perkins]], who also served as Fitzgerald's editor</span>
				<span class='text'>To create his first book of short stories Lardner had to get copies from the magazines who bought the stories â€” he held his own short stories in low regard and did not save copies</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date= July 2015}}Lardner was in some respects the model for the tragic character Abe North of Fitzgerald's last completed novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''</span>
