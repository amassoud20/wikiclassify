				<span class='text'>} also known as '''Guido Fawkes''', the name he adopted while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholics]] who planned the failed [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605</span>
				<span class='text'>awkes was born and educated in [[York]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a [[Recusancy|recusant]] Catholic</span>
				<span class='text'> Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for the continent, where he fought in the [[Eighty Years' War]] on the side of Catholic Spain against Protestant Dutch [[Protestant Reformation|reformers]]  in the [[Low Countries]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success</span>
				<span class='text'> He later met [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]], with whom he returned to England</span>
				<span class='text'>intour introduced Fawkes to [[Robert Catesby]], who planned to assassinate {{nowrap|[[James I of England|King James I]]}} and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'> The plotters leased an [[undercroft]] beneath the [[House of Lords]], and Fawkes was placed in charge of the [[gunpowder]] they stockpiled there</span>
				<span class='text'>Prompted by the receipt of an anonymous letter, the authorities searched [[Westminster Palace]] during the early hours of 5 November, and found Fawkes guarding the explosives</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next few days, he was questioned and tortured, and eventually he confessed</span>
				<span class='text'> Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes fell from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of the [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|mutilation]] that followed</span>
				<span class='text'>awkes became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been [[Guy Fawkes Night|commemorated in Britain]] since 5 November 1605</span>
