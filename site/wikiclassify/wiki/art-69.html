				<span class='text'>He concluded that &quot;real roughness is often fractal and can be measured</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot /&gt;{{rp|296}} Although Mandelbrot coined the term &quot;[[fractal]]&quot;, some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been previously described by other mathematicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties</span>
				<span class='text'>Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, &quot;rough&quot; objects in the real world</span>
				<span class='text'>His methods of research were both old and new:{{quote|The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer … bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling … and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty</span>

				<span class='text'>Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line</span>

				<span class='text'>The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to [[chaos theory]] and other fields of science and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>andelbrot also put his ideas to work in [[cosmology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the &quot;dark night sky&quot; riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient, but not necessary]], resolution of the paradox</span>
				<span class='text'>He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox</span>
				<span class='text'>His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred</span>
