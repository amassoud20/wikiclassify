			<p>
				<span class='text'> was a Japanese filmmaker</span>
				<span class='text'>Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema Kurosawa directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years</span>
				<span class='text'>urosawa entered the  industry in 1936 following a brief stint as a painter</span>
				<span class='text'>After years of working on numerous films as an  and scriptwriter he made his debut as a director in 1943 during World War II with the popular   a</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Judo Saga</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war the critically acclaimed  1948 in which Kurosawa cast then unknown actor  in a starring role cemented the directors reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife  was also an actress in one of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>which premiered in Tokyo in August 1950 and which also starred Mifune became on September 10 1951 the surprise winner of the  at the  and was subsequently released in Europe and North America</span>
				<span class='text'>The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year including a number of highly regarded films such as  1952  1954 and  1961</span>
				<span class='text'>After the mid 1960s he became much less prolific but his later work—including his final two epics  1980 and  1985—continued to win awards including the  for Kagemusha though more often abroad than in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1990 he accepted the  for </span>
				<span class='text'>  Posthumously he was named  in the Arts Literature and Culture category by  magazine and  cited as one of the five people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years</span>
				<span class='text'>Life and careerKurosawa was born on 23 March 1910 in Ōimachi in the  district of Tokyo</span>
				<span class='text'>His father Isamu a member of a former  family from  worked as the director of the Armys Physical Education Institutes  while his mother Shima came from a merchants family living in </span>
				<span class='text'>Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother</span>
				<span class='text'> name Kurosawa 1983 17 In addition to promoting physical exercise Isamu Kurosawa was open to western traditions and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged his children to watch films young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six</span>
				<span class='text'> An important formative influence was his  teacher Mr Tachikawa whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general</span>
				<span class='text'> During this time the boy also studied  and  swordsmanship</span>
				<span class='text'>Another major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa Akiras older brother by four years</span>
				<span class='text'>In the aftermath of the  of 1923 which devastated Tokyo Heigo took the 13 year old Akira to view the devastation</span>
				<span class='text'>When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere Heigo forbade him to do so instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly</span>
				<span class='text'>Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawas later artistic career as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work</span>
				<span class='text'> Heigo was academically gifted but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyos foremost  he began to detach himself from the rest of the family perring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature</span>
				<span class='text'>name Kurosawa 1983 17  In the late 1920s Heigo became a  silent film narrator for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films and quickly made a name for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Akira who at this point planned to become a painter  moved in with him and the two brothers became inseparable</span>
				<span class='text'>name Galbraith IV 2002 19  Through Heigo Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances  while exhibiting his paintings and working for the left wing Proletarian Artists League</span>
				<span class='text'>However he was never able to make a living with his art and as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas he lost his enthusiasm for painting</span>
				<span class='text'>With the increasing production of  in the early 1930s film narrators like Heigo began to lose work and Akira moved back in with his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>In July 1933 Heigo committed suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brothers death  and the chapter of his autobiography  that describes it—written nearly half a century after the event—is titled A Story I Dont Want to Tell</span>
				<span class='text'>name story  Only four months later Kurosawas eldest brother also died leaving Akira at age 23 the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living together with his three surviving sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>name Galbraith IV 2002 19  name story In 1935 the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories known as P</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>which later became the major studio  advertised for assistant directors</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession Kurosawa submitted the required essay which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them</span>
				<span class='text'>His half mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental there was no way to correct them</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawas essay earned him a call to take the follow up exams and director  who was among the examiners took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him</span>
				<span class='text'>The 25 year old Kurosawa joined P</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in February 1936</span>
				<span class='text'> During his five years as an assistant director Kurosawa worked under numerous directors but by far the most important figure in his development was Kajiro Yamamoto</span>
				<span class='text'>Of his 24 films as A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he worked on 17 under Yamamoto many of them comedies featuring the popular actor  known as Enoken</span>
				<span class='text'> Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawas talent promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawas responsibilities increased and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting script polishing rehearsals lighting dubbing editing and second unit directing</span>
				<span class='text'> In the last of Kurosawas films as an assistant director  Kurosawa took over most of the production as Yamamoto was occupied with the shooting of another film</span>
				<span class='text'>One important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa would later write or co write all of his own films</span>
				<span class='text'>He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for s film  Tsubasa no gaika</span>
				<span class='text'>This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s long after he became world famous</span>
				<span class='text'> In the two years following the release of Horse in 1941 Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career</span>
				<span class='text'>Towards the end of 1942 about a year after the  novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his  inspired  novel Sanshiro Sugata the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa</span>
				<span class='text'>He bought the book on its publication day devoured it in one sitting and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawas initial instinct proved correct as within a few days three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights</span>
				<span class='text'>Toho prevailed and Kurosawa began pre production on his debut work as director</span>
				<span class='text'> Shooting of  began on location in Yokohama in December 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>Production proceeded smoothly but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter</span>
				<span class='text'>The censorship considered the work too British American an accusation tantamount at that time to a charge of treason and it was only through the intervention of director  who championed the film that Sanshiro Sugata was finally accepted for release on March 25 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa had just turned 33</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie became both a critical and commercial success</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage much of which is now considered lost</span>
				<span class='text'> He next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in  a propaganda film which he shot in a semi documentary style in early 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot eat the factory food and call each other by their character names</span>
				<span class='text'>He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career</span>
				<span class='text'> During production the actress playing the leader of the factory workers  was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director</span>
				<span class='text'>She and Kurosawa were constantly at loggerheads and it was through these arguments that the two paradoxically became close</span>
				<span class='text'>They married on May 21 1945 with Yaguchi two months pregnant she never resumed her acting career and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985</span>
				<span class='text'>  They would have two children a son Hisao born December 20 1945 who would serve as producer on some of his fathers last projects and  born April 29 1954 who would become a costume designer</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly before his marriage Kurosawa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film</span>
				<span class='text'>The often blatantly propagandistic  which premiered in May 1945 is generally considered one of his weakest pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>    Kurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor friendly and less expensive to produce</span>
				<span class='text'> based on the Kabuki play  and starring the comedian Enoken with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days was completed in September 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time Japan had surrendered and the  had begun</span>
				<span class='text'>The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly feudal and banned the work</span>
				<span class='text'>It would not be released until 1952 the year another Kurosawa film Ikiru was also released</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically while in production the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and democratic they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion</span>
				<span class='text'> The war now ended Kurosawa absorbing the democratic ideals of the Occupation sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards the individual and the self</span>
				<span class='text'>The first such film  1946 inspired by both the 1933  and the  wartime spy case criticized Japans prewar regime for its political oppression</span>
				<span class='text'>Atypically for the director the heroic central character is a woman Yukie  born into upper middle class privilege who comes to question her values in a time of political crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>The original script had to be extensively rewritten and because of its controversial theme and because the protagonist was a woman the completed work divided critics but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences who turned variations on the films title No regrets for</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>into something of a postwar </span>
				<span class='text'>   His next film  premiered in July 1947 to mixed reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy within the devastation of postwar Tokyo their one weekly day off</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie bears the influence of   and </span>
				<span class='text'>  Another film released in 1947 with Kurosawas involvement was the action adventure thriller  directed by  from Kurosawas screenplay</span>
				<span class='text'>It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshiro Mifune</span>
				<span class='text'>It was Kurosawa who with his mentor Yamamoto had intervened to persuade Toho to sign Mifune during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kurosawa but managed to alienate most of the other judges</span>
				<span class='text'> is often considered the directors first major work</span>
				<span class='text'> Although the script like all of Kurosawas occupation era works had to go through forced rewrites due to American censorship Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely</span>
				<span class='text'>A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster  with  it was also the directors first film with Toshiro Mifune who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one Ikiru of the directors next 16 films</span>
				<span class='text'>While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character the alcoholic doctor played by  who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies</span>
				<span class='text'>However Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actors immense vitality and Mifunes rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that s defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later</span>
				<span class='text'>The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious  critics poll as the best film of its year the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored</span>
				<span class='text'>   Kurosawa with producer Sōjirō Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto  and  formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai</span>
				<span class='text'>For this organizations debut work and first film for  Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and together with Taniguchi adapted it for the screen</span>
				<span class='text'> starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with  a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being  as gangsters</span>
				<span class='text'>Released in March 1949 it was a box office success but is generally considered one of the directors lesser achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>   His second film of 1949 also produced by Film Art Association and released by  was </span>
				<span class='text'>The most celebrated of Kurosawas works from this period it is a  perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre  that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective played by Mifune and his obsession over his handgun stolen by a penniless young man who proceeds to use it to rob and murder</span>
				<span class='text'>Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his  it was the directors first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films</span>
				<span class='text'>A famous virtually wordless sequence lasting over eight minutes shows the detective disguised as an impoverished veteran wandering the streets in search of the gun thief it employed actual documentary footage of war ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawas friend  the future director of Gojira a</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>   The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary  and  genres</span>
				<span class='text'> released by  in April 1950 was inspired by the directors personal experiences with and anger towards Japanese </span>
				<span class='text'>The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory and almost all critics agree</span>
				<span class='text'>   However it would be Kurosawas second film of 1950  that would ultimately win him a whole new audience</span>
				<span class='text'>fter finishing Scandal Kurosawa was approached by  which asked the director to make another film for them</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter </span>
				<span class='text'>They would eventually write nine films together</span>
				<span class='text'>It was based on s experimental short story  which recounts the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points of view</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa saw potential in the script and with Hashimotos help polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting of Rashomon began on July 7 1950 and after extensive location work in the primeval forest of  wrapped on August 17</span>
				<span class='text'>Just one week was spent in hurried post production hampered by a studio fire and the finished film premiered at Tokyos Imperial Theatre on August 25 expanding nationwide the following day</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie was met by lukewarm reviews with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei</span>
				<span class='text'>  Kurosawas next film for Shochiku was  an adaptation of the novel by the directors favorite writer </span>
				<span class='text'>The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to  but it is otherwise very faithful to the original a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work</span>
				<span class='text'>A studio mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawas original cut of 265 minutes nearly four and a half hours to just 166 minutes making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow</span>
				<span class='text'>It is widely considered today to be one of the directors least successful works</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary reviews were very negative but the film was a moderate success at the box office largely because of the popularity of one of its stars Setsuko Hara</span>
				<span class='text'>   Meanwhile unbeknownst to Kurosawa Rashomon had been entered in the prestigious  due to the efforts of Giuliana Stramigioli a Japan based representative of an Italian film company who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 10 1951 Rashomon was awarded the festivals highest prize the  shocking not only Daiei but the international film world which at the time was largely unaware of Japans decades old cinematic tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>After Daiei very briefly exhibited a subtitled print of the film in Los Angeles  purchased distribution rights to Rashomon in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>The company was taking a considerable gamble</span>
				<span class='text'>It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been s comedy Wife Be Like a Rose in 1937 a critical and box office flop</span>
				<span class='text'>However Rashomons commercial run greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist  was very successful</span>
				<span class='text'>It earned 35000 in its first three weeks at a single New York theater an almost unheard of sum at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>This success in turn led to a vogue in America for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s replacing the enthusiasm for  cinema</span>
				<span class='text'> The film was also released by other distributors in France West Germany Denmark Sweden and Finland</span>
				<span class='text'> Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work as a result began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi    and somewhat later Yasujirō Ozu  —artists highly respected in Japan but prior to this period almost totally unknown in the West</span>
				<span class='text'> Later generations of Japanese filmmakers who would find acclaim outside Japan—from  and  to   and —were able to pass through the door that Kurosawa was the very first to open</span>
				<span class='text'>is career boosted by his sudden international fame Kurosawa now reunited with his original film studio Toho which would go on to produce his next 11 films set to work on his next project </span>
				<span class='text'>The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer ridden Tokyo bureaucrat Watanabe on a final quest for meaning before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>For the screenplay Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni who would go on to co write 12 Kurosawa films</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the works grim subject matter the screenwriters took a satirical approach which some have compared to the work of  to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>cultural colonization of Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>American pop songs figure prominently in the film</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this strategy the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>Ikiru opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo Best Film award—and enormous box office success</span>
				<span class='text'>It remains the most acclaimed of all the artists films set in the modern era</span>
				<span class='text'>  In December 1952 Kurosawa took his Ikiru screenwriters Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni for a forty five day secluded residence at an inn to create the screenplay for his next movie </span>
				<span class='text'>The  work was Kurosawas first proper  the genre for which he would become most famous</span>
				<span class='text'>The simple story about a poor farming village in  Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits was given a full epic treatment with a huge cast largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions and meticulously detailed action stretching out to almost three and a half hours of screen time</span>
				<span class='text'>name seven Three months were spent in pre production and a month in rehearsals</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kurosawas health problems</span>
				<span class='text'>The film finally opened in April 1954 half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made</span>
				<span class='text'>However by Hollywood standards it was a quite modestly budgeted production even for that time</span>
				<span class='text'>The film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could and did market internationally—though with extensive edits</span>
				<span class='text'>Over time—and with the theatrical and home video releases of the uncut version—its reputation has steadily grown</span>
				<span class='text'>It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made and in 1979 a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made</span>
				<span class='text'>name seven    In 1954 nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in Japan and one particular  in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to  with disastrous results</span>
				<span class='text'>It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawas next film  was conceived</span>
				<span class='text'>The story concerned an elderly factory owner Toshiro Mifune so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family both legal and extra marital to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil</span>
				<span class='text'>Production went much more smoothly than the directors previous film but a few days before shooting ended Kurosawas composer collaborator and close friend  died of tuberculosis at the age of 41</span>
				<span class='text'>The films score was finished by Hayasakas student  who would go on to score all of Kurosawas next eight films</span>
				<span class='text'>Record of a Living Being opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run</span>
				<span class='text'>Today it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate</span>
				<span class='text'>  Kurosawas next project  a lavishly produced adaptation of s —set like Seven Samurai in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa instructed his leading actress  to regard the work as if it were a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic</span>
				<span class='text'>Appropriately the acting of the players particularly Yamada draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater</span>
				<span class='text'>It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the directors previous film</span>
				<span class='text'>Abroad Throne of Blood regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations</span>
				<span class='text'>   Another adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately with production of  based on a  by  taking place in May and June 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to the gigantic scope and sweep of Throne of Blood The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets the better to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Though faithful to the play this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case the late —unlike his earlier The Idiot was regarded as artistically successful</span>
				<span class='text'>The film premiered in September 1957 receiving a mixed response similar to that of Throne of Blood</span>
				<span class='text'>However some critics rank it among the directors most underrated works</span>
				<span class='text'>   Kurosawas three consecutive movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had</span>
				<span class='text'>The mood of the directors work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths</span>
				<span class='text'>He recognized this and deliberately aimed for a more light hearted and entertaining film for his next production while switching to the new  format that had been gaining popularity in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting film  is an action adventure comedy drama about a medieval princess her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region</span>
				<span class='text'>Released in December 1958 The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics</span>
				<span class='text'>Today the film is considered one of Kurosawas most lightweight efforts though it remains popular not least because it is one of several major influences as  himself has conceded on Lucas hugely popular 1977  </span>
				<span class='text'>  Starting with Rashomon Kurosawas productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the directors budgets</span>
				<span class='text'>Toho concerned about this development suggested that he might help finance his own works theore making the studios potential losses smaller while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co producer</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa agreed and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959 with Toho as majority shareholder</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite risking his own money Kurosawa chose a story that was more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any work</span>
				<span class='text'> based on a script by Kurosawas nephew Mike Inoue is a revenge drama about a young man who climbs the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his fathers death</span>
				<span class='text'>Its theme proved topical while the film was in production mass demonstrations were held against the new  which was seen by many Japanese particularly the young as threatening the countrys democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians</span>
				<span class='text'>The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success</span>
				<span class='text'>The 25 minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception interrupted by reporters and police who arrest an executive for corruption is widely regarded as one of Kurosawas most skillfully executed set pieces but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals however courageous or cunning</span>
				<span class='text'>    The Bodyguard Kurosawa Productions second film centers on a masterless samurai Sanjuro who strolls into a 19th century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other</span>
				<span class='text'>The director used this work to play with many genre conventions particularly the  while at the same time offering an unprecedentedly for the Japanese screen graphic portrayal of violence</span>
				<span class='text'>Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class</span>
				<span class='text'>Featuring  in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie and with innovative photography by  who shot Rashomon and Takao Saito the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture earning more than any previous Kurosawa film</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie and its  tone were also widely imitated abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>s  was a virtual unauthorized scene by scene remake</span>
				<span class='text'>  Following the success of Yojimbo Kurosawa found himself under pressure from Toho to create a sequel</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo reworking it to include the hero of his previous film</span>
				<span class='text'> was the first of three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer  the others would be Red Beard and Dodeskaden</span>
				<span class='text'>It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones</span>
				<span class='text'>The film opened on January 1 1962 quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>  Kurosawa had meanwhile instructed Toho to purchase the film rights to Kings Ransom a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter  under his pseudonym of Ed McBain as one of his  series of crime books</span>
				<span class='text'>The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping which he considered one of the very worst crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>The suspense film titled  was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>It broke Kurosawas box office record the third film in a row to do so became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year and won glowing reviews</span>
				<span class='text'>However his triumph was somewhat tarnished when ironically the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter Kazuko</span>
				<span class='text'>High and Low is considered by many commentators to be among the directors strongest works</span>
				<span class='text'>   Kurosawa quickly moved on to his next project </span>
				<span class='text'>Based on a short story collection by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevskys novel  it is a period film set in a mid 19th century clinic for the poor in which Kurosawas humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement</span>
				<span class='text'>A conceited and materialistic foreign trained young doctor Yasumoto is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide known as Akahige Red Beard played by Mifune</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he resists Red Beard initially Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage and to perceive the patients at the clinic whom he at first despised as worthy of compassion and dignity</span>
				<span class='text'> who plays Yasumoto was an extremely popular film and music star at the time particularly for his Young Guy Wakadaishō series of musical comedies so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kurosawa strong box office</span>
				<span class='text'>The shoot the filmmakers longest ever lasted well over a year after five months of pre production and wrapped in spring 1965 leaving the director his crew and his actors exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'>Red Beard premiered in April 1965 becoming the years highest grossing Japanese production and the third and last Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll</span>
				<span class='text'>It remains one of Kurosawas best known and most loved works in his native country</span>
				<span class='text'>Outside Japan critics have been much more divided</span>
				<span class='text'>Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawas best while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artists previous commitment to social and political change</span>
				<span class='text'>   The film marked something of an end of an era for its creator</span>
				<span class='text'>The director himself recognized this at the time of its release telling critic  that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different</span>
				<span class='text'> His prediction proved quite accurate</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in the late 1950s television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience</span>
				<span class='text'>And as film company revenues dropped so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawas costly production methods</span>
				<span class='text'>Red Beard also marked the midway point chronologically in the artists career</span>
				<span class='text'>During his previous twenty nine years in the film industry which includes his five years as assistant director he had directed twenty three films while during the remaining twenty eight years for many and complex reasons he would complete only seven more</span>
				<span class='text'>Also for reasons never adequately explained Red Beard would be his final film starring Toshiro Mifune</span>
				<span class='text'>Yu Fujiki an actor who worked on The Lower Depths observed regarding the closeness of the two men on the set Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawas heart was in Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mifunes body</span>
				<span class='text'> Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique symbiosis</span>
				<span class='text'>When Kurosawas exclusive contract with Toho came to an end in 1966 the 56 year old director was seriously contemplating change</span>
				<span class='text'>Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry and having already received dozens of offers from abroad the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before</span>
				<span class='text'>For his first foreign project Kurosawa chose a story based on a  article</span>
				<span class='text'>The  action thriller to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train would have been his first in color</span>
				<span class='text'>But the language barrier proved a major problem and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966</span>
				<span class='text'>The shoot which required snow was moved to autumn 1967 then canceled in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost twenty years later another foreigner working in Hollywood  would finally make  though from a script totally different from Kurosawas</span>
				<span class='text'>The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project</span>
				<span class='text'> produced by  and Kurosawa Production would be a portrayal of the Japanese  from both the American and the Japanese points of view with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an English speaking filmmaker directing the American half</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni but very soon the project began to unravel</span>
				<span class='text'>The director chosen to film the American sequences turned out not to be the prestigious English filmmaker  as the producers had led Kurosawa to believe but the much less celebrated special effects expert </span>
				<span class='text'>The budget was also cut and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes—a major problem considering that Kurosawas script ran over four hours</span>
				<span class='text'>After numerous revisions a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting began in early December but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director</span>
				<span class='text'>He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production while his working methods puzzled his American producers who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill</span>
				<span class='text'>On Christmas Eve 1968 the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to fatigue effectively firing him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ultimately replaced for the films Japanese sequences with two directors  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Tora Tora Tora finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970 was as Donald Richie put it an almost unmitigated tragedy in Kurosawas career</span>
				<span class='text'>He had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He had his name removed from the credits though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co writers</span>
				<span class='text'>He became estranged from his longtime collaborator writer Ryuzo Kikushima and never worked with him again</span>
				<span class='text'>The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company a situation reminiscent of his own movie The Bad Sleep Well</span>
				<span class='text'>His very sanity had been called into question</span>
				<span class='text'>Worst of all the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he would never make another film</span>
				<span class='text'> Knowing that his reputation was at stake following the much publicised Tora Tora Tora debacle Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable</span>
				<span class='text'>To his aid came friends and famed directors   and  who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights Yonki no kai</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film and theore find his way back into the business</span>
				<span class='text'> The first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called Dora Heita but when this was deemed too expensive attention shifted to  an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work again about the poor and destitute</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was shot quickly by Kurosawas standards in about nine weeks with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget</span>
				<span class='text'>For his first work in color the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold almost surreal palette of primary colors in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live</span>
				<span class='text'>It was released in Japan in October 1970 but though a minor critical success it was greeted with audience indifference</span>
				<span class='text'>The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve</span>
				<span class='text'>Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the directors best work</span>
				<span class='text'>Unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point on December 22 1971 he slit his wrists and throat multiple times</span>
				<span class='text'>The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the directors health recovered fairly quickly with Kurosawa now taking uge in domestic life uncertain if he would ever direct another film</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1973 the Soviet studio  approached the filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer s autobiographical work </span>
				<span class='text'>The book about a  hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1973 the 63 year old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides beginning a year and a half stay in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding</span>
				<span class='text'>The picture wrapped in April 1975 with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June</span>
				<span class='text'> had its world premiere in Japan on August 2 1975 and did well at the box office</span>
				<span class='text'>While critical reception in Japan was muted the film was better reviewed abroad winning the Golden Prize at the  name Moscow1975  as well as an </span>
				<span class='text'>Today critics remain divided over the film some see it as an example of Kurosawas alleged artistic decline while others count it among his finest works</span>
				<span class='text'> Although proposals for television projects were submitted to him he had no interest in working outside the film world</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless the hard drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for  whiskey which aired in 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>While fearing that he might never be able to make another film the director nevertheless continued working on various projects writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1977 American director George Lucas had released  a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawas The Hidden Fortress among other works</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucas like many other  directors revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model and was shocked to discover that the Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work</span>
				<span class='text'>The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable  the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucas enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawas illustrations leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha then recruited fellow fan  as co producer</span>
				<span class='text'>name Lucas Production began the following April with Kurosawa in high spirits</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor —creator of the very popular  character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted against the directors wishes on videotaping his own performance</span>
				<span class='text'>He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980</span>
				<span class='text'>It quickly became a massive hit in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was also a critical and box office success abroad winning the coveted  at the  in May though some critics then and now have faulted the film for its alleged coldness</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha collecting awards and accolades and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film</span>
				<span class='text'> The international success of Kagemusha allowed Kurosawa to proceed with his next project  another epic in a similar vein</span>
				<span class='text'>The script partly based on s  depicted a ruthless bloodthirsty  warlord played by Tatsuya Nakadai who after foolishly banishing his one loyal son surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons who then betray him thus plunging the entire kingdom into war</span>
				<span class='text'>As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country international help was again needed</span>
				<span class='text'>This time it came from French producer  who had produced s final movies</span>
				<span class='text'>Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1985 production of Ran was halted as Kurosawas 64 year old wife Yōko fell ill</span>
				<span class='text'>She died on February 1</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa returned to finish his film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on May 31 with a wide release the next day</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was a moderate financial success in Japan but a larger one abroad and as he had done with Kagemusha Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America where he attended the films premieres in September and October</span>
				<span class='text'>Ran won several awards in Japan but was not quite as honored there as many of the directors best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been</span>
				<span class='text'>The film world was shocked however when Japan passed over the film in favor of another as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the  category</span>
				<span class='text'>Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed this to a misunderstanding because of the Academys arcane rules no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film a French film due to its financing or both so it was not submitted at all</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen the director  led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for  that year  ultimately won the award for directing </span>
				<span class='text'>Rans costume designer  won the movies only Oscar</span>
				<span class='text'> Kagemusha and Ran particularly the latter are often considered to be among Kurosawas finest works</span>
				<span class='text'>After Rans release Kurosawa would point to it as his best film a major change of attitude for the director who when asked which of his works was his best had always previously answered my next one</span>
				<span class='text'> For his next movie Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before</span>
				<span class='text'>While some of his previous pictures for example Drunken Angel and Kagemusha had included brief dream sequences  was to be entirely based upon the directors own dreams</span>
				<span class='text'>Significantly for the first time in over forty years Kurosawa for this deeply personal project wrote the screenplay alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan  who convinced  to buy the international rights to the completed film</span>
				<span class='text'>This made it easier for Kurosawas son Hisao as co producer and soon to be head of Kurosawa Production to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the films production costs</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting took more than eight months to complete and Dreams premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>name Spielberg Kurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with —the directors first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel but the films erences to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book</span>
				<span class='text'>This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star Richard Gere who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting took place in early 1991 with the film opening on May 25 that year to a largely negative critical reaction especially in the United States where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti American sentiments</span>

				<span class='text'>The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the films 81 year old creator</span>
				<span class='text'>Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September</span>
				<span class='text'>Its release on April 17 1993 was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa nevertheless continued to work</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995</span>
				<span class='text'>While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995 Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the accident he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film</span>
				<span class='text'> His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie name Gere   —was never to be fulfilled</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his accident Kurosawas health began to deteriorate</span>
				<span class='text'>While his mind remained sharp and lively his body was giving up and for the last half year of his life the director was largely confined to bed listening to music and watching television at home</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 6 1998 Kurosawa died of a stroke in  at the age of 88</span>

				<span class='text'> A script created by the Yonki no Kai Club of the Four Knights Kurosawa Keisuke Kinoshita Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa around the time that Dodeskaden was made finally was filmed and released in 2000 as Dora Heita by the only surviving founding member of the club Kon Ichikawa</span>
				<span class='text'>Working methods style and themesAll biographical sources as well as the filmmakers own comments indicate that Kurosawa was a completely hands on director passionately involved in every aspect of the filmmaking process</span>
				<span class='text'>As one interviewer summarized he co writes his scripts oversees the design rehearses the actors sets up all the shots and then does the editing</span>
				<span class='text'> His active participation extended from the initial concept to the editing and scoring of the final product</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa emphasized time and again that the screenplay was the absolute foundation of a successful film and that though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script</span>
				<span class='text'> During the postwar period he began the practice of collaborating with a rotating group of five screenwriters Eijirō Hisaita Ryuzo Kikushima  Hideo Oguni and Masato Ide</span>
				<span class='text'> Whichever members of this group happened to be working on a particular film would gather around a table often at a hot springs resort where they would not be distracted by the outside world</span>
				<span class='text'>Seven Samurai for example was written in this fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>name Harvnb Seven Samurai loc DVD featurette It Is Wonderful to Create  Often they all except Oguni who acted as eree would work on exactly the same pages of the script and Kurosawa would choose the best written version from the different drafts of each particular scene</span>
				<span class='text'> This method was adopted so that each contributor might function as a kind of foil checking the dominance of any one persons point of view</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to the actual script Kurosawa at this stage often produced extensive fantastically detailed notes to elaborate his vision</span>
				<span class='text'>For example for Seven Samurai he created six notebooks with among many other things detailed biographies of the samurai including what they wore and ate how they walked talked and behaved when greeted and even how each tied his shoes</span>
				<span class='text'>name Harvnb Seven Samurai loc DVD featurette It Is Wonderful to Create   For the 101 peasant characters in the film he created a registry consisting of 23 families and instructed the performers playing these roles to live and work as these families for the duration of shooting</span>
				<span class='text'> For his early films although they were consistently well photographed Kurosawa generally used standard lenses and deep focus photography</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning with Seven Samurai 1954 however Kurosawas cinematic technique changed drastically with his extensive use of  and multiple cameras</span>
				<span class='text'>The director claimed that he used these lenses and several cameras rolling at once to help the actors—allowing them to be photographed at some distance from the lens and without any knowledge of which particular cameras image would be utilized in the final cut—making their performances much more natural</span>
				<span class='text'> In fact Tatsuya Nakadai agreed that the multiple cameras greatly helped his performances with the director</span>
				<span class='text'> But these changes had a powerful effect as well on the look of the action scenes in that film particularly the final battle in the rain</span>
				<span class='text'>Says Stephen Prince He can use the telephoto lenses to get under the horses in between their hooves to plunge us into the chaos of that battle in a visual way that is really quite unprecedented both in Kurosawas own work and in the samurai genre as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>name Harvnb Seven Samurai loc DVD featurette Seven Samurai Origins and Influences Stephen Prince commentary With The Hidden Fortress Kurosawa began to utilize the   process for the first time in his work</span>
				<span class='text'> These three techniques—long lenses multiple cameras and widescreen—were in later works fully exploited even in sequences with little or no overt action such as the early scenes of High and Low that take place in the central characters home in which they are employed to dramatize tensions and power relationships between the characters within a highly confined space</span>
				<span class='text'>For all his films but particularly for his  Kurosawa insisted on absolute authenticity of sets costumes and props</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous instances of his fanatical devotion to detail have been recorded of which the following are only a few examples</span>
				<span class='text'>or Throne of Blood in the scene where Washizu Mifune is attacked with arrows by his own men the director had archers shoot real arrows hollowed out and running along wires toward Toshiro Mifune from a distance of about ten feet with the actor caully following chalk marks on the ground to avoid being hit</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the arrows missed him by an inch the actor who admitted that he was not merely acting terrified in the film suffered nightmares afterward</span>
				<span class='text'> For Red Beard to construct the gate for the clinic set Kurosawa had his assistants dismantle rotten wood from old sets and then create the prop from scratch with this old wood so the gate would look properly ravaged by time</span>
				<span class='text'> For the same film for teacups that appeared in the movie he ordered his crew to pour fifty years worth of tea into the cups so they would appear appropriately stained</span>
				<span class='text'>For Ran art director  constructing the third castle set under the directors supervision created the stones of that castle by having photographs taken of actual stones from a celebrated castle then painting  blocks to exactly resemble those stones and gluing them to the castle wall through a process known as rough stone piling which required months of work</span>
				<span class='text'>Later before shooting the famous scene in which the castle is attacked and set on fire in order to prevent the Styrofoam stones from melting in the heat the art department coated the surface with four layers of cement then painted the colors of the ancient stones onto the cement</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa both directed and edited most of his films which is nearly unique among prominent filmmakers</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa often remarked that he shot a film simply in order to have material to edit because the editing of a picture was the most important and creatively interesting part of the process for him</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawas creative team believed that the directors skill with editing was his greatest talent</span>
				<span class='text'>Hiroshi Nezu a longtime production supervisor on his films said Among ourselves we think that he is Tohos best director that he is Japans best scenarist and that he is the best editor in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>He is most concerned with the flowing quality which a film must haveampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The Kurosawa film flows over the cut as it were</span>
				<span class='text'>The directors frequent crew member Teruyo Nogami confirms this view</span>
				<span class='text'>Akira Kurosawas editing was exceptional the inimitable work of a geniusampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>No one was a match for him</span>
				<span class='text'> She claimed that Kurosawa carried in his head all the information about all shots filmed and if in the editing room he asked for a piece of film and she handed him the wrong one he would immediately recognize the error though she had taken detailed notes on each shot and he had not</span>
				<span class='text'>She compared his mind to a computer which could do with edited segments of film what computers do today</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawas habitual method was to edit a film daily bit by bit during production</span>
				<span class='text'>This helped particularly when he started using multiple cameras which resulted in a large amount of film to assemble</span>
				<span class='text'>I always edit in the evening if we have a fair amount of footage in the can</span>
				<span class='text'>After watching the rushes I usually go to the editing room and work</span>
				<span class='text'> Because of this practice of editing as he went along the post production period for a Kurosawa film could be startlingly brief Yojimbo had its Japanese premiere on April 20 1961 four days after shooting concluded on April 16</span>
				<span class='text'> Throughout his career Kurosawa worked constantly with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians crew members and actors popularly known as the Kurosawa gumi Kurosawa group</span>

				<span class='text'> But it has also been claimed that from his very first film the director displayed a technique quite distinct from the seamless style of classic Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>This technique involved a disruptive depiction of screen space through the use of numerous unrepeated camera setups a disregard for the traditional 180 degree axis of action around which Hollywood scenes have usually been constructed and an approach in which narrative time becomes spatialized with fluid camera movement often replacing conventional editing</span>
				<span class='text'> The following are some idiosyncratic aspects of the artists style</span>
				<span class='text'>In his films of the 1940s and 1950s Kurosawa frequently employs the  in which the camera moves closer to or further away from the subject not through the use of s or  but through a series of matched s</span>
				<span class='text'>For example in Sanshiro Sugata II the hero takes leave of the woman he loves but then after walking away a short distance turns and bows to her and then after walking further turns and bows once more</span>
				<span class='text'>This sequence of shots is illustrated on film scholar s blog</span>
				<span class='text'> The three shots are not connected in the film by camera movements or dissolves but by a series of two jump cuts</span>
				<span class='text'>The effect is to stress the duration of Sanshiros departure</span>
				<span class='text'>n the opening sequence of Seven Samurai in the peasant village the axial cut is used twice</span>
				<span class='text'>When the villagers are outdoors gathered in a circle weeping and lamenting the imminent arrival of the bandits they are glimpsed from above in extreme long shot then after the cut in a much closer shot then in an even closer shot at ground level as the dialogue begins</span>
				<span class='text'>A few minutes later when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elders advice there is a long shot of the mill with a slowly turning wheel in the river then a closer shot of this wheel and then a still closer shot of it</span>
				<span class='text'>As the mill is where the elder lives these shots forge a mental association in the viewers mind between that character and the mill</span>
				<span class='text'> A number of scholars have pointed out Kurosawas tendency to cut on motion that is to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots rather than one uninterrupted shot</span>
				<span class='text'>One scholar as an example describes a tense scene in Seven Samurai in which the samurai Shichirôji who is standing wishes to console the peasant Manzo who is sitting on the ground and he gets down on one knee to talk to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa chooses to film this simple action in two shots rather than one cutting between the two only after the action of kneeling has begun to fully convey Shichirôjis humility</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous other instances of this device are evident in the movie</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa frequently breaks up the action fragments it in order to create an emotional effect</span>
				<span class='text'>name Mellentalk  A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the </span>
				<span class='text'>This is an effect created through an  in which when a scene ends a line or bar appears to move across the screen wiping away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene</span>
				<span class='text'>As a transitional device it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the  though Kurosawa of course often used both of those devices as well</span>
				<span class='text'>In his mature work Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature</span>
				<span class='text'>For example one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in Drunken Angel</span>
				<span class='text'>There are a number of theories concerning the purpose of this device which as James Goodwin notes was common in silent cinema but became considerably rarer in the more realistic sound cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>name wipe  Goodwin claims that the wipes in Rashomon for instance fulfill one of three purposes emphasizing motion in traveling shots marking narrative shifts in the courtyard scenes and marking temporal ellipses between actions e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>between the end of one characters testimony and the beginning of anothers</span>
				<span class='text'>name wipe  He also points out that in The Lower Depths in which Kurosawa completely avoided the use of wipes the director cleverly manipulated people and props in order to slide new visual images in and out of view much as a wipe cut does</span>
				<span class='text'>An instance of the wipe used as a satirical device can be seen in Ikiru</span>
				<span class='text'>A group of women visit the local government office to petition the bureaucrats to turn a waste area into a childrens playground</span>
				<span class='text'>The viewer is then shown a series of  shots of various bureaucrats connected by wipe transitions each of whom ers the group to another department</span>
				<span class='text'>Nora Tennessen comments in her blog which shows one example that the wipe technique makes the sequence funnier—images of bureaucrats are stacked like cards each more punctilious than the last</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films Teruyo Nogamis memoir gives many such examples</span>
				<span class='text'> In the late 1940s he began to employ music for what he called counterpoint to the emotional content of a scene rather than merely to reinforce the emotion as Hollywood traditionally did and still does</span>
				<span class='text'>The inspiration for this innovation came from a family tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>When news reached Kurosawa of his fathers death in 1948 he wandered aimlessly through the streets of Tokyo</span>
				<span class='text'>His sorrow was magnified rather than diminished when he suddenly heard the cheerful vapid song The Cuckoo Waltz and he hurried to escape from this awful music</span>
				<span class='text'>He then told his composer Fumio Hayasaka with whom he was working on Drunken Angel to use The Cuckoo Waltz as ironic accompaniment to the scene in which the dying gangster Matsunaga sinks to his lowest point in the narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>This ironic approach to music can also be found in Stray Dog a film released a year after Drunken Angel</span>
				<span class='text'>In the climactic scene the detective Murakami is fighting furiously with the murderer Yusa in a muddy field</span>
				<span class='text'>The sound of a Mozart piece is suddenly heard played on the piano by a woman in a nearby house</span>
				<span class='text'>As one commentator notes In contrast to this scene of primitive violence the serenity of the Mozart is literally other worldly and the power of this elemental encounter is heightened by the music</span>
				<span class='text'> Nor was Kurosawas ironic use of the soundtrack limited to music</span>
				<span class='text'>One critic observes that in Seven Samurai During episodes of murder and mayhem birds chirp in the background as they do in the first scene when the farmers lament their seemingly hopeless fate</span>
				<span class='text'> Many commentators have noted the frequent occurrence in Kurosawas work of the complex relationship between an older and a younger man who serve each other as master and disciple respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>This theme was clearly an expression of the directors life experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa revered his teachers in particular Kajiro Yamamoto his mentor at Toho according to Joan Mellen</span>
				<span class='text'>The salutary image of an older person instructing the young evokes always in Kurosawas films high moments of pathos</span>
				<span class='text'> The critic Tadao Sato considers the recurring character of the master to be a type of surrogate father whose role it is to witness the young protagonists moral growth and approve of it</span>
				<span class='text'>In his very first film Sanshiro Sugata after the  master Yano becomes the title characters teacher and spiritual guide the narrative is cast in the form of a chronicle studying the stages of the heros growing mastery and maturity</span>
				<span class='text'> The master pupil relationship in the films of the postwar era—as depicted in such works as Drunken Angel Stray Dog Seven Samurai Red Beard and Dersu Uzala—involves very little direct instruction but much learning through experience and example Stephen Prince relates this tendency to the private and nonverbal nature of the concept of  enlightenment</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of Kagemusha however according to Prince the meaning of this relationship has changed</span>
				<span class='text'>A thief chosen to act as the double of a great lord continues his impersonation even after his masters death the relationship has become spectral and is generated from beyond the grave with the master maintaining a ghostly presence</span>
				<span class='text'>Its end is death not the renewal of commitment to the living that typified its outcome in earlier films</span>
				<span class='text'> However according to the directors biographer in his final film Madadayo—which deals with a teacher and his relationship with an entire group of ex pupils—a sunnier vision of the theme emerges The students hold an annual party for their professor attended by dozens of former students now adults of varying ageampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>This extended sequenceampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>expresses as only Kurosawa can the simple joys of student teacher relationships of kinship of being alive</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawas is a heroic cinema a series of dramas mostly concerned with the deeds and fates of larger than life heroes</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen Prince has identified the emergence of the unique Kurosawa protagonist with the immediate post World War II period</span>
				<span class='text'>The goal of the  to replace Japanese  with  coincided with the directors artistic and social agenda Kurosawa welcomed the changed political climate and sought to fashion his own mature cinematic voice</span>
				<span class='text'> The Japanese critic Tadao Sato concurs With defeat in World War II many Japaneseampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>were dumbfounded to find that the government had lied to them and was neither just nor dependable</span>
				<span class='text'>During this uncertain time Akira Kurosawa in a series of first rate films sustained the people by his consistent assertion that the meaning of life is not dictated by the nation but something each individual should discover for himself through suffering</span>
				<span class='text'> The filmmaker himself remarked that during this period I felt that without the establishment of the self as a positive value there could be no freedom and no democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>The first such postwar hero was atypically for the artist a heroine—Yukie played by Setsuko Hara in No Regrets for Our Youth</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Prince her desertion of family and class background to assist a poor village her perseverance in the face of enormous obstacles her assumption of responsibility for her own life and for the well being of others and her  lonelinessampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>are essential to Kurosawan heroism and make of Yukie the first coherentampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>example</span>
				<span class='text'> This existential loneliness is also exemplified by Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Sanada Takashi Shimura in Drunken Angel Kurosawa insists that his heroes take their stand alone against tradition and battle for a better world even if the path there is not clear</span>
				<span class='text'>Separation from a corrupt social system in order to alleviate human suffering as Sanada does is the only honorable course</span>
				<span class='text'>Many commentators regard Seven Samurai as the ultimate expression of the artists heroic ideal</span>
				<span class='text'>Joan Mellens comments are typical of this view Seven Samurai is above all a homage to the samurai class at its most nobleampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Samurai for Kurosawa represent the best of Japanese tradition and integrity</span>
				<span class='text'> Ironically it is because of not in spite of the chaotic times of civil war depicted in the film that the seven rise to greatness</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa locates the unexpected benefits no less than the tragedy of this historical moment</span>
				<span class='text'>The upheaval forces samurai to channel the selflessness of their credo of loyal service into working for peasants</span>
				<span class='text'> However this heroism is futile because there was already risingampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a merchant class which would supplant the warrior aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'> So the courage and supreme skill of the central characters will not prevent the ultimate destruction of themselves or their class</span>
				<span class='text'>s Kurosawas career progressed he seemed to find it increasingly difficult to sustain the heroic ideal</span>
				<span class='text'>As Prince notes Kurosawas is an essentially tragic vision of life and this sensibilityampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>impedes his efforts to realize a socially committed mode of filmmaking</span>
				<span class='text'> Furthermore the directors ideal of heroism is subverted by history itself When history is articulated as it is in Throne of Blood as a blind forceampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>heroism ceases to be a problem or a reality</span>
				<span class='text'> According to Prince the filmmakers vision eventually became so bleak that he would come to view history merely as eternally recurring patterns of violence within which the individual is depicted as not only unheroic but utterly helpless see  below</span>
				<span class='text'>Nature is a crucial element in Kurosawas films</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Stephen Prince Kurosawas sensibility like that of many Japanese artists is keenly sensitive to the subtleties and beauties of season and scenery</span>
				<span class='text'> He has never hesitated to exploit climate and weather as plot elements to the point where they become active participants in the dramaampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The oppressive heat in Stray Dog and Record of a Living Being is omnipresent and becomes thematized as a signifier of a world disjointed by economic collapse and the atomic threat</span>
				<span class='text'> The director himself once said I like hot summers cold winters heavy rains and snows and I think most of my pictures show this</span>
				<span class='text'>I like extremes because I find them most alive</span>
				<span class='text'>Wind is also a powerful symbol The persistent metaphor of Kurosawas work is that of wind the winds of change of fortune and adversity</span>
				<span class='text'> The visually flamboyant final battle of Yojimbo takes place in the main street as huge clouds of dust swirl around the combatantsampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The winds that stir the dustampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>have brought firearms to the town along with the culture of the West which will end the warrior tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also difficult not to notice the importance of rain to Kurosawa Rain in Kurosawas films is never treated neutrally</span>
				<span class='text'>When it occursampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it is never a drizzle or a light mist but always a frenzied downpour a driving storm</span>
				<span class='text'> The final battle in Seven Samurai is a supreme spiritual and physical struggle and it is fought in a blinding rainstorm which enables Kurosawa to visualize an ultimate fusion of social groupsampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>but this climactic vision of classlessness with typical Kurosawan ambivalence has become a vision of horror</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle is a vortex of swirling rain and mudampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The ultimate fusion of social identity emerges as an expression of hellish chaos</span>
				<span class='text'> Beginning with Throne of Blood 1957 an obsession with historical cycles of inexorable savage violence—what Stephen Prince calls the countertradition to the committed heroic mode of Kurosawas cinema —first appears</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Donald Richie within the world of that film Cause and effect is the only law</span>
				<span class='text'>Freedom does not exist</span>
				<span class='text'> and Prince claims that its events are inscribed in a cycle of time that infinitely repeats</span>
				<span class='text'>name circle  He uses as evidence the fact that Washizus lord unlike the kindly King Duncan of Shakespeares play had murdered his own lord years before to seize power and is then murdered in turn by Washizu the Macbeth character for the same reason</span>
				<span class='text'>name circle  The fated quality to the action of ampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was transposed by Kurosawa with a sharpened emphasis upon predetermined action and the crushing of human freedom beneath the laws of </span>
				<span class='text'>name circle Prince claims that Kurosawas last epics Kagemusha and particularly Ran mark a major turning point in the directors vision of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kagemusha where once in the world of his films the individual hero could grasp events tightly and demand that they conform to his or her impulses now the self is but the epiphenomenon of a ruthless and bloody temporal process ground to dust beneath the weight and force of history</span>
				<span class='text'> The following epic Ran is a relentless chronicle of base lust for power betrayal of the father by his sons and pervasive wars and murders</span>
				<span class='text'>name Ran  The historical setting of the film is used as a commentary on what Kurosawa now perceives as the timelessness of human impulses toward violence and self destruction</span>
				<span class='text'>name Ran  History has given way to a perception of life as a wheel of endless suffering ever turning ever repeating which is compared in many instances in the screenplay with hell</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa has found hell to be both the inevitable outcome of human behavior and the appropriate visualization of his own bitterness and disappointment</span>
				<span class='text'>CriticismsIn the early to mid 1950s a number of critics belonging to the French New Wave championed the films of the older Japanese master  at the expense of Kurosawas work</span>
				<span class='text'>New Wave critic filmmaker  said You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enoughampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Mizoguchi seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality that of an individual</span>
				<span class='text'>  According to such French commentators Mizoguchi seemed of the two artists the more authentically Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between Japanese Mizoguchi and Western Kurosawa by pointing out that Mizo had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa and that this is lected in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>A criticism frequently directed at Kurosawas films is that the directors preoccupation with ethical and moral themes led him at times to create what some commentators regard as  or naïve work</span>
				<span class='text'>Speaking of the postwar  drama One Wonderful Sunday for example film scholar and future politician  claimed that not even Kurosawas celebrated prowess as an editor could save one particular scene from  The last sequenceampnbsp</span>

				<span class='text'>Angles and focal lengths change details of leaves scattering in the wind are intercut but nothing makes the scene go any faster</span>
				<span class='text'>Some controversy exists about the extent to which Kurosawas films of the Second World War period could be considered </span>
				<span class='text'>The cultural historian Peter B</span>
				<span class='text'>High sees Kurosawas wartime cinema as part of the propagandistic trend of Japan at war and as an example of many of these wartime conventions</span>
				<span class='text'>High ers to his second film The Most Beautiful as a dark and gloomy rendition of the standard formulas of the home front genre</span>
				<span class='text'> Another controversy centers on his alleged usal to acknowledge Japans wartime guilt</span>
				<span class='text'>In one of Kurosawas last films Rhapsody in August an elderly survivor of the  is visited by her half Japanese half American nephew Clark  who appears at least to some viewers to apologize as an American for the citys wartime destruction</span>
				<span class='text'>The  critic  wrote about this film A lot of people at  were outraged that the film makes no mention of  and Japans atrocities in Chinaampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>If Clark can apologize for bombing  why cant Granny apologize for the raid on Pearl Harbor A number of critics have reacted negatively to the female characters in Kurosawas movies</span>
				<span class='text'>Joan Mellen in her examination of this subject has maintained that by the time of Red Beard 1965 women in Kurosawa have become not only unreal and incapable of kindness but totally bet of autonomy whether physical intellectual or emotionalampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Women at their best may only imitate the truths men discover</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince concurs with Mellens view though less censoriously Unlike a male oriented director like  Kurosawa is not hostile to women but his general lack of interest in them should be regarded as a major limitation of his work</span>
				<span class='text'>In Japan both critics and other filmmakers have sometimes accused his work of elitism because of his focus on exceptional heroic individuals and groups of men</span>
				<span class='text'>In her commentary on the deluxe DVD edition of Seven Samurai Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo which to her reveal Kurosawa privileging these samurai support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitistampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director they argued since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead justifying the inequitable class structure of their society and ours the peasants must rely on the aristocracy the upper class and in particular samurai to ensure their survivalampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me</span>
				<span class='text'>I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger closely clinging to the earthampnbsp</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time</span>
				<span class='text'>name Mellentalk  Because of Kurosawas popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>Joan Mellen recording the violently negative reaction in the 1970s of the left wing director  to Kurosawa and his work states That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant to Oshima that he must be  to Western values and politics</span>
				<span class='text'> Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes He has never catered to a foreign audience writes Audie Bock and has condemned those who do</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived arrogant behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in Japan that the initially disparaging nickname Kurosawa Tennō—The Emperor Kurosawa—was coined</span>
				<span class='text'>Like  Yoshimoto claimed Kurosawa is said to cloister himself in his own small world which is completely cut off from the everyday reality of the majority of Japanese</span>
				<span class='text'>The nickname tennō is used in this sense to create an image of Kurosawa as a director who abuses his power solely for the purpose of self indulgence</span>
				<span class='text'>Worldwide impactMany celebrated directors have been influenced by Kurosawa and or have expressed admiration for his work</span>
				<span class='text'>The filmmakers cited below are grouped according to three categories a those who like Kurosawa himself established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s b the so called  directors that is American moviemakers who for the most part established their reputations in the early to mid 1970s and c other Asian directors</span>
