				<span class='text'>A talented swimmer and artist, she also became interested in dancing during her childhood, taking dancing lessons and performing across [[Europe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film ''[[The Holy Mountain (1926 film)|Der Berg des Schicksals]]'' (&quot;The Mountain of Destiny&quot;), Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1925 and 1929, she starred in five successful motion pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1932, Riefenstahl decided to try directing with her own film called ''[[Das Blaue Licht]]'' (&quot;The Blue Light&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s, she directed ''[[Triumph des Willens]]'' (&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;) and ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim</span>
				<span class='text'>Both movies are widely considered two of the most effective, and technically innovative, [[propaganda film]]s ever made</span>
				<span class='text'>Her involvement in ''Triumph des Willens'', however, would significantly damage her career and reputation after the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact nature of her relationship with [[Nazi Party]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] remains a matter of debate, although a friendship is known to have existed</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the war, Riefenstahl was arrested, but classified as being a &quot;[[fellow traveler]]&quot; only and was not associated with [[war crimes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout her life, she denied having known about the [[Holocaust]], and won nearly 50 libel cases</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Johnson 2014}} Her father, Alfred, owned a successful heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter to follow him into the business world</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her to carry on the family name and secure the family fortune</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} However, her mother, Bertha, who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Trimborn 2007}}{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 36 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in [[Nazi Germany]]'s war against the [[Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rother|2003|p=112}}Riefenstahl fell in love with the arts in her childhood</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Salkeld|2011|p=2}} She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a gymnastic and swim club</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of [[Snow White]] which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified profession</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}==Dancing and acting careers==Riefenstahl attended dancing academies and became well known for her self-styled interpretive dancing skills, traveling across Europe with [[Max Reinhardt]] in a show funded by Jewish producer [[Harry Sokal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Falcon 2003}}{{sfn|Infield|1976|pp=14–16}} Riefenstahl often made almost 700 ''[[Reichmark]]s'' for each performance and was so captivated with dancing that she gave filmmaking no thought</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Infield|1976|pp=14–16}} She began to suffer foot injuries that led to knee surgery, threatening her dancing career</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film ''[[Mountain of Destiny|Der Berg des Schicksals]]'' (&quot;The Mountain of Destiny&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}On one of her adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was an actor from ''Der Berg des Schicksals''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} At a meeting arranged by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met [[Arnold Fanck]], the director of ''Der Berg des Schicksals'' and a pioneer of the [[mountain film]] genre</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} Fanck was working on a film in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>After Riefenstahl told him how much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film ''Der Heilige Berg'' (&quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film editing techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was ''[[The White Hell of Pitz Palu|Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü]]'' (&quot;The White Hell of [[Piz Palü]]&quot;) of 1929, co-directed by [[G</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=77}} This film won the Silver Medal at the [[Venice Film Festival]], but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, many of whom were Jewish</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|James 2007}}{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=19}} Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|James 2007}} In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She is hated and cast out</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Müller 1999}} The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=19}} He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=19}}In 1933, Riefenstahl would appear in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}} Describing the experience in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote, &quot;I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget</span>
				<span class='text'>It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in front of me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}}After meeting Hitler, Riefenstahl was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Der Sieg des Glaubens ]]'' (&quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth [[Nuremberg Rally]] in 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}} Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=20}} More than one million Germans participated in the rally</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|The History Place 2001}} Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted and did not want to create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on Hitler's favourite opera, [[Eugen d'Albert]]'s ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'' (&quot;Lowlands&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=20}} Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of ''Tiefland'', but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=20}} Hitler was able to convince her to film ''Triumph des Willens'' on the condition that she would not be required to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|pp=21–22}} The motion picture was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of [[propaganda]] filmmaking</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|pp=21–22}} The film took Riefenstahl's career to a new level and gave her further international recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=21}}In interviews for the 1993 documentary ''[[The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl]]'', Riefenstahl adamantly denied any deliberate attempt to create [[Nazi propaganda]] and said she was disgusted that ''Triumph des Willens'' was used in such a way</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Müller 1999}}Despite allegedly vowing not to make any more films about the Nazi Party, Riefenstahl made the 28-minute ''[[Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht]]'' (&quot;Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces&quot;) about the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rother|2003|p=238}} Like ''Der Sieg des Glaubens'' and ''Triumph des Willens'', this was filmed at the annual Nazi Party rally at Nuremberg</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rother|2003|p=238}} Riefenstahl said this film was a sub-set of ''Der Sieg des Glaubens'', added to mollify the German Army which felt it was not represented well in ''Triumph des Willens''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Aitken|2013|p=760}}Hitler invited Riefenstahl to film the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] scheduled to be held in Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the [[International Olympic Committee]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tomlinson|2012|pp=74–76}} This material became ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Graham 1993}}From the ''[[Goebbels Diaries]]'', researchers learned that Riefenstahl had been friendly with [[Joseph Goebbels]] and his wife [[Magda Goebbels|Magda]], attending the opera with them and going to his parties</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rollyson 2007}} Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|James 2007}} She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|James 2007}} By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with what he saw as her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|James 2007}}===World War II===When [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Riefenstahl was photographed in Poland wearing a military uniform and a pistol on her belt in the company of German soldiers; she had gone to Poland as a war correspondent</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Robert 2013}}{{sfn|James 2007}} On 12 September, she was in the town of [[Końskie]] when 30 civilians were executed in retaliation for an alleged attack on German soldiers</span>
