				<span class='text'>Gradually as the plain Micky [sic] Mouse gave way to his coloured version and Donald Duck appeared, silence came upon Rud</span>
				<span class='text'>And then to the infinite astonishment of Norvel, he broke out suddenly</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Who is this Walt Disney? He seems to me to be a very dangerous revolutionary</span>
