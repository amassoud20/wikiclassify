				<span class='text'>He was originally named Wenceslaus (''Václav''), the name of his maternal grandfather, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|King Wenceslaus II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose the name Charles at his [[confirmation]] in honor of his uncle, [[Charles IV of France|King Charles IV of France]], at whose court he was resident for seven years</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1331 he gained some experience of warfare in Italy with his father</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of 1333, Charles went to [[Lucca]] ([[Tuscany]]) to consolidate his rule there</span>
				<span class='text'>In an effort to defend the city, Charles founded the nearby fortress and the town of [[Montecarlo, Tuscany|Montecarlo]] (Charles' Mountain)</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1334, Charles was named [[Margrave of Moravia]], the traditional title for heirs to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, he assumed the government of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] on behalf of his brother, [[John Henry, Margrave of Moravia|John Henry]], and was soon actively involved in a struggle for the possession of this county</span>
				<span class='text'>==King of the Romans===On 11 July 1346, in consequence of an alliance between his father and [[Pope Clement VI]], relentless enemy of the emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]], Charles was chosen as Roman [[Anti-king|king in opposition]] to Louis by some of the [[prince-electors]] at [[Rhens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As he had previously promised to be subservient to Clement, he made extensive concessions to the pope in 1347</span>
				<span class='text'>Confirming the papacy in the possession of wide territories, he promised to annul the acts of Louis against Clement, to take no part in Italian affairs, and to defend and protect the church</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Karte Böhmen unter Karl IV</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemia]] and other territories ruled by Charles IV]]Charles IV was initially in a very weak position in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to the terms of his election, he was derisively referred to by some as a &quot;Priests' King&quot; (''Pfaffenkönig'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Many bishops and nearly all of the [[Imperial State|Imperial cities]] remained loyal to Louis the Bavarian</span>
				<span class='text'>Worse yet, Charles backed the wrong side in the [[Hundred Years' War]], losing his father and many of his best knights at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in August 1346, with Charles himself escaping from the field wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>ivil war in Germany was prevented, however, when Louis IV died on 11 October 1347, after suffering a stroke during a bear hunt</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1349, [[House of Wittelsbach]] partisans attempted to secure the election of [[Günther von Schwarzburg]] as king, but he attracted few supporters and died unnoticed and unmourned after a few months</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereafter, Charles faced no direct threat to his claim to the Imperial throne</span>
				<span class='text'>harles initially worked to secure his power base</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bohemia]] had remained untouched by the plague</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Prague]] became his capital, and he rebuilt the city on the model of Paris, establishing the [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] (''Nové Město'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1348, he founded the [[Charles University in Prague]], which was named after him and was the first university in Central Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>This served as a training ground for bureaucrats and lawyers</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon Prague emerged as the intellectual and cultural center of Central Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>Vitus Cathedral]], 1370s]]Having made good use of the difficulties of his opponents, Charles was again elected in [[Frankfurt]] on 17 June 1349 and re-crowned at [[Aachen]] on 25 July 1349</span>
				<span class='text'>He was soon the undisputed ruler of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Gifts or promises had won the support of the Rhenish and [[Swabia]]n towns; a marriage alliance secured the friendship of the Habsburgs; and an alliance with [[Rudolf II, Duke of Bavaria|Rudolf II of Bavaria]], [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], was obtained when Charles, who had become a widower in 1348, married Rudolph's daughter [[Anna of Bavaria|Anna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1350 the king was visited at Prague by the Roman tribune [[Cola di Rienzo]], who urged him to go to Italy, where the poet [[Petrarch]] and the citizens of [[Florence]] also implored his presence</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Turning a deaf ear to these entreaties, Charles kept Cola in prison for a year, and then handed him as a prisoner to Clement at [[Avignon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>utside Prague, Charles attempted to expand the Bohemian crown lands, using his imperial authority to acquire fiefs in [[Silesia]], the [[Upper Palatinate]], and [[Franconia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter regions comprised &quot;New Bohemia,&quot; a string of possessions intended to link Bohemia with the Luxemburg territories in the Rhineland</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bohemian estates, however, were not willing to support Charles in these ventures</span>
				<span class='text'>When Charles sought to codify Bohemian law in the Majestas Carolina of 1355, he met with sharp resistance</span>
				<span class='text'>After that point, Charles found it expedient to scale back his efforts at centralization</span>

				<span class='text'>aving given [[Moravia]] to one brother, [[John Henry of Bohemia|John Henry]], and erected the [[county of Luxembourg]] into a duchy for another, [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg|Wenceslaus]], he was unremitting in his efforts to secure other territories as compensation and to strengthen the Bohemian monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end he purchased part of the upper [[Palatinate of the Rhine]] in&amp;nbsp;1353, and in 1367 annexed [[Lower Lusatia]] to Bohemia and bought numerous estates in various parts of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>On the death of [[Meinhard III of Gorizia-Tyrol|Meinhard, Duke of Upper Bavaria]] and [[Count of Tyrol]], in 1363, [[Upper Bavaria]] was claimed by the sons of the emperor Louis&amp;nbsp;IV, and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] by [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;IV, Duke of Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both claims were admitted by Charles on the understanding that if these families died out both territories should pass to the [[House of Luxembourg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At about the same time he was promised the succession to the [[Margravate of Brandenburg]], which he actually obtained for his son Wenceslaus in&amp;nbsp;1373</span>

				<span class='text'>After the repeal of the estate contract by margrave Otto, in early July 1371, Charles IV declared hostilities and invaded Brandenburg; after two years of conflict the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1373 became part of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Czech lands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also gained a considerable portion of [[Silesia]]n territory, partly by inheritance through his third wife, [[Anna von Schweidnitz]], daughter of [[Henry II, Duke of Świdnica]] and [[Catherine of Hungary (d</span>
				<span class='text'>1355)|Catherine of Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1365 Charles visited [[Pope Urban&amp;nbsp;V]] at [[Avignon]] and undertook to escort him to Rome; on the same occasion he was crowned King of [[Lower Burgundy|Burgundy]] at [[Arles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is second journey to Italy took place in 1368, when he had a meeting with Pope Urban&amp;nbsp;V at [[Viterbo]], was besieged in his palace at [[Siena]], and left the country before the end of 1369</span>
				<span class='text'>During his later years, the emperor took little part in German affairs beyond securing the election of his son Wenceslaus as king of the Romans in&amp;nbsp;1376, and negotiating a peace between the [[Swabian League of Cities]] and some nobles in&amp;nbsp;1378</span>
				<span class='text'>After dividing his lands between his three sons and his nephews,&lt;ref name=Herzfeld /&gt; he died in November 1378 at [[Prague]], where he was buried, and where a statue was erected to his memory in&amp;nbsp;1848</span>
				<span class='text'>harles IV suffered from [[gout]] (metabolic arthritis), a painful disease quite common in that time</span>
				<span class='text'>=Evaluation and legacy==The reign of Charles IV was characterised by a transformation in the nature of the Empire and is remembered as the [[Golden Age]] of Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>He promulgated the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] whereby the succession to the imperial title was laid down, which held for the next four centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>e also organized the states of the empire into peace-keeping [[confederations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In these, the Imperial cities figured prominently</span>
				<span class='text'>The Swabian Landfriede confederation of 1370 was made up almost entirely of [[Free imperial city|Imperial Cities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, the leagues were organized and led by the crown and its agents</span>
				<span class='text'>As with the electors, the cities that served in these leagues were given privileges to aid in their efforts to keep the peace</span>
				<span class='text'>e assured his dominance over the eastern borders of the Empire through succession treaties with the [[Habsburg]]s and the purchase of Brandenburg</span>
				<span class='text'>He also claimed imperial lordship over the crusader states of [[Prussia]] and [[Livonia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Czech Gothic architecture|High Gothic]] [[Prague Castle]] and part of the [[Saint Vitus Cathedral|cathedral of Saint Vitus]] by [[Peter Parler]] were also built under his patronage</span>
				<span class='text'> Finally, the first flowering of manuscript painting in Prague dates from Charles' reign</span>
				<span class='text'>In the present [[Czech Republic]], he is still regarded as ''[[Pater Patriae]]'' ([[Father of the Nation|father of the country]] or ''otec vlasti''), a title first coined by [[Adalbertus Ranconis de Ericinio]] at his funeral</span>
				<span class='text'>harles also had strong ties to [[Nuremberg]], staying within its city walls 52 times and thereby strengthening its reputation amongst German cities</span>
				<span class='text'> Charles was the patron of the [[Nuremberg Frauenkirche]], built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely [[Peter Parler]]), where the imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg</span>
				<span class='text'>harles's imperial policy was focused on the dynastic sphere and abandoned the lofty ideal of the Empire as a universal monarchy of Christendom</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1353 he granted [[County, Duchy and Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] to his half-brother, [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg|Wenceslaus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He concentrated his energies chiefly on the economic and intellectual development of Bohemia, where he founded the university in 1348 and encouraged the [[Renaissance humanism|early humanists]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He corresponded with [[Petrarch]] and invited him to visit the royal residence in Prague, whilst the Italian hoped — to no avail — to see Charles move his residence to Rome and reawaken tradition of the [[Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>harles's sister [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bona]] married the eldest son of [[Philip&amp;nbsp;VI of France]], the future [[John&amp;nbsp;II of France]], in 1335</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Charles was the maternal uncle of [[Charles&amp;nbsp;V of France]], who solicited his relative's advice at [[Metz]] in 1356 during the [[Parisian Revolt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This family connection was celebrated publicly when Charles made a solemn visit to his nephew in 1378, just months before his death</span>
