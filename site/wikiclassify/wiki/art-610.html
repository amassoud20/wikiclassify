				<span class='text'>105&lt;/ref&gt;===Scholasticus' account===The most complete account of Hypatia's death comes from the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (or &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;), written around AD 415 by [[Socrates Scholasticus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>restes, the Roman governor of Alexandria, and Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, were involved in a bitter feud in which Hypatia became one of the main points of contention</span>
				<span class='text'>In 415 AD, the feud began over Jewish dancing exhibitions in Alexandria, which attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes published an [[edict]] that outlined new regulations for such gatherings, and crowds gathered to read the edict shortly after it was posted in the city's theater</span>
				<span class='text'>The edict angered Christians as well as Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>At one such gathering, [[Hierax (Ascetic)|Hierax]], a devout Christian follower of Cyril, read the edict and applauded the new regulations</span>
				<span class='text'>Many people felt that Hierax was attempting to incite the crowd into [[sedition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes reacted swiftly and violently out of what Scholasticus suspected was &quot;jealousy [of] the growing power of the bishops…[which] encroached on the jurisdiction of the authorities&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He ordered Hierax to be seized and tortured publicly in the theater</span>
				<span class='text'>earing of Hierax's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with &quot;the utmost severities&quot; if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>They plotted to flush out the Christians at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire</span>
				<span class='text'>Christians responded to what they believed was their church burning down, and &quot;the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them,&quot; using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight</span>
				<span class='text'>When the morning came, the Jews of Alexandria could not hide their guilt, and Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city's synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre</span>
				<span class='text'>yril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria, then ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Orestes [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified because of these things, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation</span>
				<span class='text'>When that failed, he made an appeal to Orestes's allegiances as a Christian Roman,&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus: &quot;''believing that respect for religion would induce him to lay aside his resentment</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; showing the [[Gospels]] to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, approximately 500 monks resided in the [[Nitria (monastic site)|mountains of Nitria]] who were &quot;of a very fiery disposition&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They heard of the ongoing feud between the Governor and Bishop and descended into Alexandria armed and prepared to fight alongside Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon their arrival, the monks intercepted Orestes's chariot and proceeded to bombard and harass him, calling him a pagan idolater</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to such allegations, Orestes countered that he was actually a Christian and had even been baptized by [[Archbishop Atticus of Constantinople|Atticus]], the Bishop of [[Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The monks paid little attention to Orestes's claims of Christianity, and one of the monks named [[Ammonius (monk)|Ammonius]] struck Orestes in the head with a rock, causing him to bleed profusely</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point, Orestes's guards fled in fear, but a nearby crowd of Alexandrians came to his aid</span>
				<span class='text'>Ammonius was subsequently captured and ordered to be tortured for his actions, during which he died</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the death of Ammonius, Cyril ordered that he henceforth be remembered as a [[martyr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a proclamation did not sit well with &quot;sober-minded&quot; Christians, as Scholasticus pointed out, seeing that he &quot;suffered the punishment due to his rashness he would not deny [[Christ]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This fact, according to Scholasticus, became apparent to Cyril through general lack of enthusiasm for Ammonius's case for martyrdom</span>
				<span class='text'>cholasticus then introduces Hypatia, the female philosopher of Alexandria and the woman who became a target of the Christian anger that was inflamed during the feud</span>
				<span class='text'>She was the daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] and a teacher trained in the philosophical schools of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She was admired by most for her dignity and virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholasticus writes that Hypatia ultimately fell &quot;victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Orestes was known to seek her counsel, and a rumor spread among the Christian community of Alexandria blaming her for Orestes's unwillingness to reconcile with Cyril</span>
				<span class='text'>A mob of Christians gathered, led by a [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]] (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> a minor cleric) named Peter, whom Scholasticus calls a fanatic</span>
				<span class='text'>They kidnapped Hypatia on her way home and took her to the &quot;Church called [[Caesareum of Alexandria|Caesareum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They then completely stripped her, and then murdered her with tiles</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Socrates Scholasticus was interpreted as saying that, while she was still alive, Hypatia's flesh was torn off using oyster shells (tiles; the Greek word is ''ostrakois'', which literally means &quot;with ''or'' by oystershells&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ὀστράκοις}}, ''ostrakois'', is the [[Dative|DAT]] [[Plural number|pl</span>
				<span class='text'>] form of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὄστρακον#Ancient Greek|ὄστρακον]]}}, ''[[wikt:ostracon#English|ostrakon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>See {{LSJ|o)/strakon|ὄστρακον|ref}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but the word was also used for brick tiles on the roofs of houses and for pottery sherds)</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterward, the men proceeded to mutilate her and, finally, burn her limbs</span>
				<span class='text'>News of Hypatia's murder provoked great public denouncement, not only against Cyril but against the whole Alexandrian Christian community</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholasticus closes with a lament: &quot;Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===The account given in the ''Chronicle'' of John of Nikiu===Hypatia's death is also told in another source, ''The Chronicle,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ertullian</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle</span>
				<span class='text'>tm John, Bishop of Nikiu: ''Chronicle''</span>
				<span class='text'>London (1916)</span>
				<span class='text'>English Translation]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; written by [[John of Nikiu]] in Egypt around 650 AD</span>
				<span class='text'>This account demonizes Hypatia and Orestes directly, while validating all Christians involved in the events Nikiu describes</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Chronicle'' is more biased on the matter of the historical feud, omitting several points of the narrative that are included in Scholasticus's account</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus (born after 380 AD, died after 439 AD), ''Ecclesiastical History''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Bishop John of Nikiu, who lived several hundred years after the events he describes, writes bitterly of Hypatia, claiming that &quot;she beguiled many people through (her) Satanic wiles&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John of Nikiu, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, c</span>
				<span class='text'>700 AD&lt;/ref&gt; Orestes, who Nikiu writes was himself a victim of Hypatia's demonic charm, regularly honored her and abandoned the Christian Church in order to follow her teachings more closely</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, the Bishop claimed that Orestes himself persuaded others to leave the Church in favor of Hypatia's philosophical teachings and went as far as to host such &quot;unbelievers&quot; at his house</span>
				<span class='text'>ne day, Orestes published an edict &quot;regarding public exhibitions in the city of Alexandria&quot; and all citizens gathered to read the edict</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyril, curious to see why the edict caused such an uproar, sent Hierax, a &quot;Christian possessing understanding and intelligence&quot;, who, although opposed to paganism, did as Cyril asked and went to learn the nature of Orestes's edict</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, the Jews who gathered in anger over the edict believed that Hierax had come only for the sake of provocation (which, according to Scholasticus's text, was Hierax's intent)</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon this assumption, Orestes had Hierax punished for a crime for which &quot;he was wholly guiltless&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>or the punishment and torture of Hierax, as well as the death of several monks, including Ammonius, Cyril grew increasingly furious with Orestes</span>
				<span class='text'>(Here, Nikiu blatantly ignores the assault on Orestes by the 500 monks, in which Ammonius played an active role in bringing about his own torture and death</span>
				<span class='text'> Cyril then warned the Jews against any further harm upon the Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>However, with the support of Orestes (which is in no way implied by Scholasticus), the Jews felt confident in defying Cyril's authority, and so one night ran through the streets proclaiming: &quot;The church of the apostolic Athanasius (Alexander) is on fire: come to its succour, all ye Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Christians responded to the alarms only to be slaughtered by the Jews in a coordinated ambush</span>
				<span class='text'>he next morning, all remaining Christians of the town came to Cyril with news of the massacre, after which Cyril marched with them to purge the Jews from Alexandria</span>
				<span class='text'>In so doing, Cyril allowed the pillaging of their possessions, and soon after purified all the synagogues in the city and made them into Churches (Scholasticus makes no mention of &quot;purifying&quot; the Synagogues)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the expulsion of the Jews, Orestes was unable to offer them any assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly thereafter, a group of Christians, under Peter the magistrate, went looking for Hypatia, the &quot;pagan woman who had beguiled the people of the city and the prefect through her enchantments&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They found her sitting in a chair, at which point they seized and brought her to &quot;the great church, named Caesarion&quot;, where they proceeded to rip the clothes off her body</span>
				<span class='text'>Then they dragged her through the streets of Alexandria until she died and burned her remains</span>
				<span class='text'>Nikiu's description of Hypatia's death also differs from that of Scholasticus</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the death of Hypatia, Bishop Cyril was named &quot;the new Theophilus&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>With the death of Hypatia, Nikiu writes, the Christians had expelled the last remnant of pagan idolatry</span>

				<span class='text'>For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes, it was calumniously reported among the Christian populace that it was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of them, therefore, hurried away by a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home and, dragging her from her carriage, they took her to the church called Caesareum, where they completely stripped her, and then murdered her with tiles</span>
