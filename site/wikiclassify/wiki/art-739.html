				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|upright|11-year-old Sibelius in 1876]]===Early years===Sibelius was born on 8 December 1865 in [[Hämeenlinna]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], an autonomous part of the [[Russian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the son of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] medical doctor Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius {{née}} Borg</span>
				<span class='text'>The family name stems from the Sibbe Estate in [[Eastern Uusimaa]] which was owned by his paternal great grandfather</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=8}} Sibelius's father died of [[typhoid]] in July 1868, leaving substantial debts</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his mother—who was again pregnant—had to sell their property and move the family into the home of Katarina Borg, her widowed mother, who also lived in Hämeenlinna</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Goss|2009|p=19}} Sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment, the only male influence coming from his uncle, Pehr Ferdinand Sibelius, who was interested in music, especially the violin</span>
				<span class='text'>It was he who gave the boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Goss|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=905}} For Sibelius, Uncle Pehr not only took the place of a father but of a musical adviser</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murtmäki|2000}}From an early age, Sibelius showed a strong interest in nature, frequently walking around the countryside when the family moved to [[Loviisa]] on the coast for the summer months</span>
				<span class='text'>In his own words: &quot;For me, Loviisa represented sun and happiness, Hämeenlinna was where I went to school</span>
				<span class='text'>Loviisa was freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It was in Hämeenlinna, when he was seven, that his aunt Julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on the family's upright instrument, rapping him on the knuckles whenever he played a wrong note</span>
				<span class='text'>He reacted by improvising on his own but nevertheless learned to read music</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=4}} He later turned to the violin which he preferred</span>
				<span class='text'>He participated in trios with his elder sister Linda, who played the piano, and his younger brother Christian on the cello</span>
				<span class='text'>([[Christian Sibelius]] was to become an eminent [[psychiatrist]], still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in Finland</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |accessdate=11 June 2015 |p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Sibelius often played in quartets with neighbouring families, receiving a background in chamber music</span>
				<span class='text'>Fragments survive of his early compositions of the period, a trio, a piano quartet and a ''Suite in D Minor'' for violin and piano</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ringbom|1950|pp=10–13}} Around 1881, he recorded on paper his short [[pizzicato]] piece ''Vattendroppar'' (Water Drops) for violin and cello although it might just have been a musical exercise</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;childhood&quot;/&gt; In 1881, he started to take violin lessons from the local bandmaster, Gustaf Levander, immediately developing a particularly strong interest in the instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=6}} Setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso, he soon succeeded in becoming quite an accomplished player, performing [[Ferdinand David (musician)|David]]'s Concerto in E minor in 1886 and, the following year, the last two movements of [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto]] in Helsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his success as an instrumentalist, he ultimately chose to become a composer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Grimley|2004|p=67}}&lt;ref name=&quot;sih&quot;/&gt;Although his mother tongue was Swedish, in 1874 Sibelius attended Lucina Hagman's Finnish-speaking preparatory school</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1876, he was then able to continue his education at the Finnish-language [[Hämeenlinna Normal-Lycée|Hämeenlinna Normal Lyceum]] where he proved to be a rather absent-minded pupil although he did quite well in mathematics and botany</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=14}} As a boy he was known as [[Janne]], a colloquial form of Johan</span>
				<span class='text'>However, during his student years, he adopted the French form [[Jean (male given name)|Jean]], inspired by the business card of his deceased seafaring uncle</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|left|[[Martin Wegelius]], Sibelius's teacher in Finland]]After graduating from high school in 1885, Sibelius began to study law at the [[University of Helsinki|Imperial Alexander University in Finland]] but, showing far more interest in music, soon moved to the Helsinki Music Institute (now the [[Sibelius Academy]]) where he studied from 1885 to 1889</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his teachers was its founder, [[Martin Wegelius]], who did much to support the development of education in Finland</span>
				<span class='text'>It was he who gave the self-taught Sibelius his first formal lessons in composition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Goss|2009|p=75}} Another important influence was his teacher [[Ferruccio Busoni]], a pianist with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}} His close circle of friends included the pianist and writer [[Adolf Paul]] and the conductor-to-be [[Armas Järnefelt]] (who introduced him to his influential family including his sister Aino who would become Sibelius's wife)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Murtmäki|2000}} The most remarkable of his works during this period was the Violin Sonata in F, rather reminiscent of [[Grieg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=62}}Sibelius continued his studies in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) with [[Albert Becker (composer)|Albert Becker]] and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891) with [[Robert Fuchs]] and the Hungarian [[Karl Goldmark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Berlin, he had the opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas, including the premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also heard the Finnish composer [[Robert Kajanus]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in a programme which included his symphonic poem ''Aino'', a patriotic piece which may well have triggered Sibelius's later interest in using the epic poem ''Kalevala'' as a basis for his compositions</span>

				<span class='text'>He enjoyed his year in Vienna, frequently partying and gambling with his new friends</span>

				<span class='text'>Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night</span>
				<span class='text'>I hated pen and ink—unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kaufman|1938|p=218}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In addition to the long periods he spent studying in Vienna and Berlin (1889–91), in 1900 travelled to Italy where he spent a year with his family</span>
				<span class='text'>He composed, conducted and socialized actively in the Scandinavian countries, the UK, France and Germany</span>

				<span class='text'>His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations</span>
				<span class='text'>The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger &quot;themes&quot; effectively prove the opposite</span>

				<span class='text'>Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of ''Kuolema'' (meaning death)</span>
				<span class='text'>The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1904, Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as ''Valse triste''</span>
				<span class='text'>An instant success, it took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius's signature pieces</span>

				<span class='text'>After substantial revisions, a new version was premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the [[Staatskapelle Berlin|Berlin Court Orchestra]]</span>

				<span class='text'>t |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Nature==Sibelius loved nature, and the Finnish landscape often served as material for his music</span>
				<span class='text'>He once said of his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>6 (Sibelius)|Sixth Symphony]], &quot;[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of Tapiola</span>
				<span class='text'>On the subject of Sibelius's ties to nature, his biographer, Erik Tawaststjerna, wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Even by Nordic standards, Sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to the moods of nature and the changes in the seasons: he scanned the skies with his binoculars for the geese flying over the lake ice, listened to the screech of the cranes, and heard the cries of the curlew echo over the marshy grounds just below Ainola</span>
				<span class='text'>He savoured the spring blossoms every bit as much as he did autumnal scents and colours</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;==Reception==Sibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life, at least in English-speaking and Nordic countries</span>
				<span class='text'>The Finnish symphonist [[Leevi Madetoja]] was a pupil of Sibelius</span>
				<span class='text'>In Britain, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[Arnold Bax]] both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, ''Tapiola'' is prominently echoed in both Bax's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>6 (Bax)|Sixth Symphony]] and Moeran's [[Symphony in G minor (Moeran)|Symphony in G Minor]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1 (Walton)|First Symphony]] of [[William Walton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Freed|1995}} When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius's music was very much in vogue, with conductors like Beecham and [[John Barbirolli|Barbirolli]] championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record</span>
				<span class='text'>Walton's composer friend [[Constant Lambert]] even claimed that Sibelius was &quot;the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lambert|1934|p=318}} Earlier, [[Granville Bantock]] had championed Sibelius (the esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society)</span>
				<span class='text'>More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Malcolm Arnold]] acknowledged his influence, and [[Arthur Butterworth]] also saw Sibelius's music as a source of inspiration in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Walker|2008}}[[Eugene Ormandy]] and to a lesser extent, his predecessor with the Philadelphia Orchestra [[Leopold Stokowski]], were instrumental in bringing Sibelius's music to American audiences by frequently programming his works; the former developed a friendly relationship with Sibelius throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life, Sibelius was championed by the American critic [[Olin Downes]], who wrote a biography of the composer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Goss|1995}}In 1938 [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote a critical essay, notoriously charging that &quot;If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the 'multi-faceted' in 'the one'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Adorno|1938}} Adorno sent his essay to [[Virgil Thomson]], then music critic of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', who was also critical of Sibelius; Thomson, while agreeing with the essay's sentiment, declared to Adorno that &quot;the tone of it [was] more apt to create antagonism toward [Adorno] than toward Sibelius&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ross|2009}} Later, the composer, theorist and conductor [[René Leibowitz]] went so far as to describe Sibelius as &quot;the worst composer in the world&quot; in the title of a 1955 pamphlet</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leibowitz|1955}}Perhaps one reason Sibelius has attracted both the praise and the ire of critics is that in each of his seven symphonies he approached the basic problems of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways</span>
				<span class='text'>On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, while others thought that music should be taking a different route</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Sibelius's birthplace in Hämeenlinna]]In the latter decades of the twentieth century, Sibelius began to be re-assessed more favourably: [[Milan Kundera]] dubbed the composer's approach to be that of &quot;antimodern modernism&quot;, standing outside the perpetual progression of the status quo</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ross|2009}} In 1990, the composer [[Thea Musgrave]] was commissioned by the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] to write a piece in honour of the 125th anniversary of Sibelius's birth: ''Song of the Enchanter'' was premiered on 14 February 1991</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ross|2009}}Writing in 1996, the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning music critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] stated, &quot;There are two things to be said straightaway about Sibelius</span>
				<span class='text'>First, he is terribly uneven (much of his chamber music, a lot of his songs and most of his piano music might have been churned out by a second-rate salon composer from the 19th century on an off afternoon)</span>
