				<span class='text'>His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>apone was born in the [[Brooklyn|borough of Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]] to [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was considered a [[Five Points Gang]] member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels</span>
				<span class='text'>In his early twenties, he moved to [[Chicago]] and became bodyguard and trusted factotum for [[Johnny Torrio]], head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol &amp;ndash; the forerunner of the Outfit &amp;ndash; and that was politically protected through the [[Unione Siciliana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A conflict with the [[North Side Gang]] was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall</span>
				<span class='text'>Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to Capone</span>
				<span class='text'>Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] and the city's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement</span>
				<span class='text'>apone apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games</span>
				<span class='text'>He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many to be a &quot;modern-day [[Robin Hood]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] of gang rivals, resulting in the killing of seven men in broad daylight, damaged Chicago's image - as well as Capone's - leading influential citizens to demand governmental action and newspapers to dub him &quot;Public Enemy No</span>
				<span class='text'>1&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone, and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931, a federal crime and a novel strategy during the era</span>
				<span class='text'> During the highly publicized case, the judge admitted as evidence Capone's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior (and ultimately abortive) negotiations to pay the government any back taxes he owed</span>
				<span class='text'> Capone was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After conviction, he replaced his old defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a Supreme Court ruling, but his appeal ultimately failed</span>
				<span class='text'>e was already showing signs of syphilitic [[dementia]] early in his sentence, and he became increasingly debilitated before being released after eight years</span>
				<span class='text'>On January 25, 1947, Capone died of [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a stroke</span>
