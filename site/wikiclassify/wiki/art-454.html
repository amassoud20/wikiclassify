				<span class='text'>This expedition, led by [[Adrien de Gerlache]] using the ship the [[RV Belgica (1884)|RV ''Belgica'']], became the first expedition to winter in Antarctica</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mifflin&quot; /&gt; The ''Belgica'', whether by mistake or design, became locked in the [[sea ice]] at 70°30′S off [[Alexander Island]], west of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The crew endured a winter for which they were poorly prepared</span>
				<span class='text'>By Amundsen's own estimation, the doctor for the expedition, the American [[Frederick Cook]], probably saved the crew from [[scurvy]] by hunting for animals and feeding the crew fresh meat</span>
				<span class='text'>In cases where citrus fruits are lacking, fresh meat from animals that make their own vitamin C (which most do) contains enough of the vitamin to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it</span>
				<span class='text'>This was an important lesson for Amundsen's future expeditions</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Roald Amundsen, 1908]]In 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to successfully traverse Canada's [[Northwest Passage]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans</span>
				<span class='text'>He planned a small expedition of six men in a 45-ton fishing vessel, ''[[Gjøa]],'' in order to have flexibility</span>
				<span class='text'>His ship had relatively shallow draft</span>
				<span class='text'>His technique was to use a small ship and hug the coast</span>
				<span class='text'>Amundsen had the ship outfitted with a small gasoline engine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Derry&quot; /&gt; They traveled via [[Baffin Bay]], the [[Parry Channel]] and then south through [[Peel Sound]], [[James Ross Strait]], [[Simpson Strait]] and [[Rae Strait]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They spent two winters (1903–04 and 1904–05) at [[King William Island]] in the harbor of what is today [[Gjoa Haven, Nunavut|Gjoa Haven]], [[Nunavut]], Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mifflin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Derry&quot; /&gt; During this time, Amundsen and the crew learned from the local [[Netsilik Inuit]] people about [[Arctic]] survival skills, which he found invaluable in his later expedition to the South Pole</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he learned to use [[sled dog]]s for transportation of goods and to wear animal skins in lieu of heavy, woolen parkas, which could not deter cold when wet</span>
				<span class='text'>eaving Gjoa Haven, he sailed west and passed [[Cambridge Bay]], which had been reached from the west by [[Richard Collinson]] in 1852</span>
				<span class='text'> Continuing to the south of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], the ship cleared the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] on 17 August 1905</span>

				<span class='text'>His team reached Nome in 1906</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the water along the route was sometimes as shallow as {{convert|3|ft|abbr=on}}, a larger ship could not have made the voyage</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2010}}At this time, Amundsen learned that [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norway had formally become independent of Sweden]] and had a new king</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Amundsen in 1920]]In 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, ''[[Maud (ship)|Maud]]'', lasted until 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>''Maud'' sailed west to east through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]], now called the ''Northern Route'' (1918–20)</span>
				<span class='text'>ith him on this expedition were [[Oscar Wisting]] and [[Helmer Hanssen]], both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Henrik Lindstrøm was included as a cook</span>
				<span class='text'>He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate</span>
				<span class='text'>he goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s earlier expedition with ''Fram''</span>
				<span class='text'>The plan was to sail along the coast of [[Siberia]] and go into the ice farther to the north and east than Nansen had</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to Amundsen's earlier expeditions, this was expected to yield more material for academic research, and he carried the geophysicist [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] on board</span>
				<span class='text'>he voyage was to the northeasterly direction over the [[Kara Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Amundsen planned to freeze the ''Maud'' into the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice cap]] and drift towards the North Pole (as Nansen had done with the ''Fram''), and he did so off [[Cape Chelyuskin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice</span>
				<span class='text'>In September 1919, the crew got the ship loose from the ice, but it froze again after eleven days somewhere between the [[New Siberian Islands]] and [[Wrangel Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uring this time, Amundsen participated little in the work outdoors, such as sleigh rides and hunting, because he had suffered numerous injuries</span>

				<span class='text'>Several of the crew ashore there, including Hanssen, did not return on time to the ship</span>
				<span class='text'>Amundsen considered Hanssen to be in breach of contract, and dismissed him from the crew</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the third winter, ''Maud'' was frozen in the western Bering Strait</span>
				<span class='text'>She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching [[Seattle, Washington]], in the US Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order</span>
				<span class='text'>He took with him two young indigenous girls, the adopted four-year-old Kakonita and her companion Camilla</span>
				<span class='text'>When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla's father, who lived in eastern Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Amundsen adoption&quot; /&gt;In June 1922, Amundsen returned to ''Maud'', which had been sailed to Nome</span>
				<span class='text'>He decided to shift from the planned naval expedition to aerial ones, and arranged to charter a plane</span>
				<span class='text'>He divided the expedition team in two: one part was to survive the winter and prepare for an attempt to fly over the pole</span>
				<span class='text'>This part was led by Amundsen</span>
				<span class='text'>The second team on ''Maud'', under the command of Wisting, was to resume the original plan to drift over the North Pole in the ice</span>
				<span class='text'>The ship drifted in the ice for three years east of the New Siberian Islands, never reaching the North Pole</span>
				<span class='text'>It was finally seized by Amundsen's creditors as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for his mounting debt</span>
				<span class='text'>he attempt to fly over the Pole failed, too</span>
				<span class='text'>Amundsen and [[Oskar Omdal]], of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], tried to fly from [[Wainwright, Alaska]], to [[Spitsbergen]] across the North Pole</span>
				<span class='text'>When their aircraft was damaged, they abandoned the journey</span>
				<span class='text'>To raise additional funds, Amundsen traveled around the United States in 1924 on a lecture tour</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough he was unable to reach the North Pole, the scientific results of the expedition, mainly the work of Sverdrup, have proven to be of considerable value</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these carefully collected scientific data were lost during the ill-fated journey of [[Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen]], two crew members sent on a mission by Amundsen</span>

				<span class='text'>Amundsen and his crew worked for more than three weeks to clean up an airstrip to take off from ice</span>
				<span class='text'>They shovelled 600 tons of ice while consuming only one pound (400&amp;nbsp;g) of daily food rations</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, six crew members were packed into the N-25</span>
