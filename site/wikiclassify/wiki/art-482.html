				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|200px|Renaissance relief of the Queen of Sheba meeting Solomon – gate of [[Florence Baptistry]]]]In a brief, unelaborated, and enigmatic passage, the Hebrew Bible describes how the fame of Solomon's wisdom and wealth spread far and wide, so much so that the queen of [[Sheba]] decided that she should meet him</span>
				<span class='text'>The queen is described as visiting with a number of gifts including gold, spices and precious stones</span>
				<span class='text'>When Solomon gave her &quot;all her desire, whatsoever she asked,&quot; she left satisfied ([http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>hether the passage is simply to provide a brief token, foreign witness of Solomon's wealth and wisdom, or whether there is meant to be something more significant to the queen's visit is unknown; nevertheless the visit of the Queen of Sheba has become the subject of numerous stories</span>
				<span class='text'>[Sheba]] is typically identified as [[Sabaeans|Saba]], a nation once spanning the [[Red Sea]] on the coasts of what are now [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Yemen]], in [[Arabia Felix]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a Rabbinical account (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [[Targum Sheni]]), Solomon was accustomed to ordering the living creatures of the world to dance before him (Rabbinical accounts say that Solomon had been given control over all living things by Yahweh), but one day upon discovering that the mountain-cock or [[hoopoe]] (Hebrew name: ''shade'') was absent, he summoned it to him, and the bird told him that it had been searching for somewhere new</span>
				<span class='text'>he bird had discovered a land in the east, exceedingly rich in gold, silver, and plants, whose capital was called ''Kitor'' and whose ruler was the Queen of Sheba, and the bird, on its own advice, was sent by Solomon to request the queen's immediate attendance at Solomon's court</span>
				<span class='text'>n Ethiopian account from the 14th century (''[[Kebra Nagast]]'') maintains that the Queen of Sheba had sexual relations with King Solomon and gave birth by the Mai Bella stream in the province of [[Hamasien]], [[Eritrea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ethiopian tradition has a [[Queen of Sheba#Ethiopian accounts|detailed account of the affair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The child was a son who went on to become [[Menelik I]], King of [[Kingdom of Axum|Axum]], and founded a [[Solomonic dynasty|dynasty]] that would reign as the first Jewish, then Christian [[Empire of Ethiopia]] for 2,900+ years (less one [[Zagwe dynasty|usurpation episode]], an interval of c</span>
				<span class='text'>133 years until a legitimate male heir regained the crown) until [[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown in 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>Menelik was said to be a practicing Jew who was given a replica of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] by King Solomon; and, moreover, that the original was switched and went to [[Axum]] with him and his mother, and is still there, guarded by a single priest charged with caring for the artifact as his life's task</span>
				<span class='text'>he claim of such a lineage and of possession of the Ark has been an important source of legitimacy and prestige for the Ethiopian monarchy throughout the many centuries of its existence, and had important and lasting effects on Ethiopian culture as a whole</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Kenneth Kitchen]] agrees, arguing that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy &quot;mini-empire&quot;, rather than a small city-state, and considers 666 gold talents a modest amount of money</span>
				<span class='text'>Kitchen calculates that over 30 years, such a kingdom might have accumulated up to 500 tons of gold, which is small compared to other examples, such as the 1,180 tons of gold that [[Alexander the Great]] took from Susa</span>

				<span class='text'>Some scholars and historians argue that Solomon's apparent initial devotion to Yahweh, described in passages such as his dedication prayer ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:14–66|HE}}), were written much later, after Jerusalem had become the religious centre of the kingdom, replacing locations such as [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] and [[Bethel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some scholars believe that passages such as these in the [[Books of Kings]] were not written by the same authors who wrote the rest of the text, instead probably by the [[Deuteronomist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dever 2001 145&quot;/&gt; Such views have been challenged by other historians who maintain that there is evidence that these passages in Kings are derived from official court records at the time of Solomon and from other writings of that time that were incorporated into the canonical books of Kings</span>

				<span class='text'>In a single year, according to {{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:14|HE}}, Solomon collected [[tribute]] amounting to 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (39,960 pounds) of gold</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon is described as surrounding himself with all the luxuries and the grandeur of an [[Eastern world|Eastern]] monarch, and his government prospered</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered into an alliance with [[Hiram I]], king of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings</span>
				<span class='text'>or some years before his death, David was engaged in collecting materials for building a [[Solomon's Temple|temple in Jerusalem]] as a permanent home for [[Yahweh]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon is described as completing its construction, with the help of an architect, also named [[Hiram Abiff|Hiram]], and other materials, sent from King Hiram of Tyre</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the completion of the temple, Solomon is described as erecting many other buildings of importance in [[Jerusalem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For 13 years, he was engaged in the building of a royal palace on [[Ophel]] (a hilly promontory in central Jerusalem)</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city, and the [[Millo]] ([[Septuagint]], ''Acra'') for the defense of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>However, excavations of Jerusalem have shown a distinct lack of monumental architecture from the era, and remains of neither the Temple nor Solomon's palace have been found</span>
				<span class='text'>olomon is also described as rebuilding cities elsewhere in Israel, creating the port of [[Ezion-Geber]], and constructing [[Palmyra]] in the wilderness as a commercial depot and military outpost</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the location of the port of Ezion-Geber is known, no remains have ever been found</span>
				<span class='text'>More archaeological success has been achieved with the major cities Solomon is said to have strengthened or rebuilt, for example, [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and [[Gezer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse |1|Kings|9:15|HE}})&lt;/ref&gt; These all have substantial ancient remains, including impressive six-chambered gates, and [[ashlar]] palaces, however it is no longer the scholarly consensus that these structures date to the time, according to the Bible, when Solomon ruled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Finkelstein /&gt;According to the Bible, during Solomon's reign, Israel enjoyed great commercial prosperity, with extensive traffic being carried on by land with [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Egypt]], and [[Arabia]], and by sea with [[Tarshish]], [[Ophir]], and [[South India]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Sometimes, protagonists discovered Solomon's words which aimed to help those who were lost and unluckily reached those forbidden and deserted places</span>
				<span class='text'>==Angels and magic===According to the [[Rabbinical literature]], on account of his modest request for wisdom only, Solomon was rewarded with riches and an unprecedented glorious realm, which extended over the upper world inhabited by the angels and over the whole of the terrestrial globe with all its inhabitants, including all the beasts, fowl, and reptiles, as well as the demons and spirits</span>
				<span class='text'>His control over the demons, spirits, and animals augmented his splendor, the demons bringing him precious stones, besides water from distant countries to irrigate his exotic plants</span>
				<span class='text'>The beasts and fowl of their own accord entered the kitchen of Solomon's palace, so that they might be used as food for him, and extravagant meals for him were prepared daily by each of his 700 wives and 300 concubines, with the thought that perhaps the king would feast that day in her house</span>
				<span class='text'>===Seal of Solomon====A [[magic ring]] called the &quot;[[Seal of Solomon]]&quot; was supposedly given to Solomon and gave him power over demons</span>
				<span class='text'>The magical symbol said to have been on the Seal of Solomon which made it work is now better known as the ''[[Star of David]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Asmodai|Asmodeus]], king of demons, was one day, according to the classical Rabbis, captured by [[Benaiah]] using the ring, and was forced to remain in Solomon's service</span>
				<span class='text'>In one tale, Asmodeus brought a man with two heads from under the earth to show Solomon; the man, unable to return, married a woman from Jerusalem and had seven sons, six of whom resembled the mother, while one resembled the father in having two heads</span>
				<span class='text'>After their father's death, the son with two heads claimed two shares of the inheritance, arguing that he was two men; Solomon decided that the son with two heads was only one man</span>
				<span class='text'>The Seal of Solomon, in some legends known as the Ring of Aandaleeb, was a highly sought after symbol of power</span>
				<span class='text'>In several legends, different groups or individuals attempted to steal it or attain it in some manner</span>
				<span class='text'>===Solomon and Asmodeus====One legend concerning [[Asmodeus]] goes on to state that Solomon one day asked Asmodeus what could make demons powerful over man, and Asmodeus asked to be freed and given the ring so that he could demonstrate; Solomon agreed but Asmodeus threw the ring into the sea and it was swallowed by a fish</span>
				<span class='text'>Asmodeus then swallowed the king, stood up fully with one wing touching heaven and the other earth, and spat out Solomon to a distance of 400 miles</span>
				<span class='text'>The Rabbis claim this was a divine punishment for Solomon's having failed to follow three divine commands, and Solomon was forced to wander from city to city, until he eventually arrived in an Ammonite city where he was forced to work in the king's kitchens</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon gained a chance to prepare a meal for the Ammonite king, which the king found so impressive that the previous cook was sacked and Solomon put in his place; the king's daughter, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], subsequently fell in love with Solomon, but the family (thinking Solomon a commoner) disapproved, so the king decided to kill them both by sending them into the desert</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon and the king’s daughter wandered the desert until they reached a coastal city, where they bought a fish to eat, which just happened to be the one which had swallowed the magic ring</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon was then able to regain his throne and expel Asmodeus</span>
				<span class='text'>The element of a ring thrown into the sea and found back in a fish's belly also appeared in [[Herodotus]]' account of [[Polycrates]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Samos]] from c</span>
				<span class='text'>538&amp;nbsp;BC to 522&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>n another familiar version of the legend of the Seal of Solomon, Asmodeus disguises himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In some myths, he's disguised as King Solomon himself, while in more frequently heard versions he's disguised as a falcon, calling himself Gavyn (Gavinn or Gavin), one of King Solomon’s trusted friends</span>
				<span class='text'>The concealed Asmodeus tells travelers who have ventured up to King Solomon's grand lofty palace that the Seal of Solomon was thrown into the sea</span>
				<span class='text'>He then convinces them to plunge in and attempt to retrieve it, for if they do they would take the throne as king</span>
				<span class='text'>===Artifacts====Other magical items attributed to Solomon are [[key of Solomon|his key]] and his Table</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter was said to be held in [[Toledo, Spain]] during [[Visigoth]] rule and was part of the loot taken by [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]] during the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia]], according to [[Ibn Abd-el-Hakem]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Spain''</span>
				<span class='text'>The former appears in the title of the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]], a [[grimoire]] whose [[Frame story|framing story]] is Solomon capturing demons using his ring, and forcing them to explain themselves to him</span>
				<span class='text'>===Angels====Angels also helped Solomon in building the Temple; though not by choice</span>
				<span class='text'>The edifice was, according to rabbinical legend, miraculously constructed throughout, the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones by means of a ''[[Solomon's Shamir|shamir]]'', a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Midrash Tehillim]], the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon's eagle; but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm's haunts by Asmodeus</span>
				<span class='text'>The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone, and the rooster had sworn to guard it well, but Solomon's men found the bird's nest, and covered it with glass</span>
				<span class='text'>When the bird returned, it used the shamir to break the glass, whereupon the men scared the bird, causing it to drop the worm, which the men could then bring to Solomon</span>
				<span class='text'>===In the Kabbalah====Early adherents of the [[Kabbalah]] portray Solomon as having sailed through the air on a throne of light placed on an eagle, which brought him near the heavenly gates as well as to the dark mountains behind which the fallen angels ''Uzza'' and ''Azzazel'' were chained; the eagle would rest on the chains, and Solomon, using the magic ring, would compel the two angels to reveal every mystery he desired to know</span>
				<span class='text'>===The palace without entrance====According to one legend, while traveling magically, Solomon noticed a magnificent palace to which there appeared to be no entrance</span>
				<span class='text'>He ordered the demons to climb to the roof and see if they could discover any living being within the building but the demons only found an eagle, which said that it was 700 years old, but that it had never seen an entrance</span>
				<span class='text'>An elder brother of the eagle, 900 years old, was then found, but it also did not know the entrance</span>
				<span class='text'>The eldest brother of these two birds, which was 1,300 years old, then declared it had been informed by its father that the door was on the west side, but that it had become hidden by sand drifted by the wind</span>
				<span class='text'>Having discovered the entrance, Solomon found an idol inside that had in its mouth a silver tablet saying in Greek (a language not thought by modern scholars to have existed 1000 years before the time of Solomon) that the statue was of ''Shaddad, the son of 'Ad'', and that it had ''reigned over a million cities, rode on a million horses, had under it a million vassals and slew a million warriors'', yet it could not resist the [[death (personification)|angel of death]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Solomon at his throne, painting by Andreas Brugger, 1777]]Solomon's throne is described at length in [[Targum Sheni]], which is compiled from three different sources, and in two later [[Midrash]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to these, there were on the steps of the throne twelve golden lions, each facing a golden eagle</span>
				<span class='text'>There were six steps to the throne, on which animals, all of gold, were arranged in the following order: on the first step a lion opposite an ox; on the second, a wolf opposite a sheep; on the third, a tiger opposite a camel; on the fourth, an eagle opposite a peacock, on the fifth, a cat opposite a cock; on the sixth, a sparrow-hawk opposite a dove</span>
				<span class='text'>On the top of the throne was a dove holding a sparrow-hawk in its claws, symbolizing the dominion of Israel over the Gentiles</span>
				<span class='text'>The first midrash claims that six steps were constructed because Solomon foresaw that six kings would sit on the throne, namely, Solomon, [[Rehoboam]], [[Hezekiah]], [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], [[Amon of Judah|Amon]], and [[Josiah]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There was also on the top of the throne a golden [[candelabrum]], on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job, and on the seven of the other the names of Levi, Kohath, Amram, Moses, Aaron, Eldad, Medad, and, in addition, Hur (another version has Haggai)</span>
				<span class='text'>Above the candelabrum was a golden jar filled with olive-oil and beneath it a golden basin which supplied the jar with oil and on which the names of Nadab, Abihu, and Eli and his two sons were engraved</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the throne, twenty-four vines were fixed to cast a shadow on the king's head</span>
				<span class='text'>y a mechanical contrivance the throne followed Solomon wherever he wished to go</span>
				<span class='text'>Supposedly, due to another mechanical trick, when the king reached the first step, the ox stretched forth its leg, on which Solomon leaned, a similar action taking place in the case of the animals on each of the six steps</span>
				<span class='text'>From the sixth step the eagles raised the king and placed him in his seat, near which a golden serpent lay coiled</span>
				<span class='text'>When the king was seated the large eagle placed the crown on his head, the serpent uncoiled itself, and the lions and eagles moved upward to form a shade over him</span>
				<span class='text'>The dove then descended, took the scroll of the Law from the Ark, and placed it on Solomon's knees</span>
				<span class='text'>When the king sat, surrounded by the [[Sanhedrin]], to judge the people, the wheels began to turn, and the beasts and fowls began to utter their respective cries, which frightened those who had intended to bear false testimony</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, while Solomon was ascending the throne, the lions scattered all kinds of fragrant spices</span>
				<span class='text'>After Solomon's death, Pharaoh [[Shishak]], when taking away the treasures of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] (I Kings xiv</span>
				<span class='text'>26), carried off the throne, which remained in Egypt until [[Sennacherib]] conquered that country</span>
				<span class='text'>After Sennacherib's fall Hezekiah gained possession of it, but when Josiah was slain by Pharaoh [[Necho II|Necho]], the latter took it away</span>
				<span class='text'>However, according to [[rabbinical]] accounts, Necho did not know how the mechanism worked and so accidentally struck himself with one of the lions causing him to become lame; Nebuchadnezzar, into whose possession the throne subsequently came, shared a similar fate</span>
				<span class='text'>The throne then passed to the Persians, whose king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] was the first to sit successfully on Solomon's throne after his death; subsequently the throne came into the possession of the Greeks and [[Ahasuerus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Solomon Kohan is later revealed as one of the extremely long-lived &quot;Wise&quot; [[Enoch Root]], and compares a courtyard full of inventors' workstations to &quot;an operation I used to have in Jerusalem a long time ago,&quot; denominating either facility as &quot;a temple</span>
