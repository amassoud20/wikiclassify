				<span class='text'>name ODNB  A  on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event</span>
				<span class='text'>His date of birth was given in his obituary in  as 26 December 1792 but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier in 1791</span>
				<span class='text'>The parish register of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Marys  shows that Babbage was  on 6 January 1792 supporting a birth year of 1791</span>
				<span class='text'>  Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a banking partner of  in founding Praeds amp Co</span>

				<span class='text'> In 1808 the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in </span>
				<span class='text'>Around the age of eight Babbage was sent to a country school in  near Exeter to recover from a life threatening fever</span>
				<span class='text'>For a short time he attended  in  South Devon but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time</span>
				<span class='text'>Babbage then joined the 30 student Holmwood academy in Baker Street   under the Reverend Stephen Freeman</span>
				<span class='text'>The academy had a library that prompted Babbages love of mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was a clergyman near  through him Babbage encountered  and his evangelical followers but the tuition was not what he needed</span>
				<span class='text'> He was brought home to study at the Totnes school this was at age 16 or 17</span>
				<span class='text'> The second was an Oxford tutor under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>t the University of CambridgeBabbage arrived at  in October 1810</span>
				<span class='text'>name   Venn  He was already self taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics  he had read in   and </span>
				<span class='text'>As a result he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at Cambridge</span>

				<span class='text'>name   Venn  He was the top mathematician there but did not graduate with honours</span>
				<span class='text'>He instead received a degree without examination in 1814</span>
				<span class='text'>He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB After CambridgeConsidering only his reputation Babbage quickly made progress</span>
				<span class='text'>He lectured to the  on astronomy in 1815 and was elected a  in 1816</span>

				<span class='text'>Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of  who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives</span>
				<span class='text'> This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company prompted by  and mooted in 1824 but not carried out</span>
				<span class='text'> Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme using  mortality data from 1762 onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>During this whole period Babbage depended awkwardly on his fathers support given his fathers attitude to his early marriage of 1814 he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a home in  in London and founded a large family</span>
				<span class='text'> On his fathers death in 1827 Babbage inherited a large estate value around £100000 equivalent to £ in todays pounds making him independently wealthy</span>
				<span class='text'>name ODNB  After his wifes death in the same year he spent time travelling</span>
				<span class='text'>In Italy he met  foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont</span>
				<span class='text'>name Essinger  In April 1828 he was in Rome and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project when he heard that he had become professor at Cambridge a position he had three times failed to obtain in 1820 1823 and 1826</span>
				<span class='text'>Babbage was instrumental in founding the  in 1820</span>
				<span class='text'> Its initial aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form and to circulate data</span>
				<span class='text'> These directions were closely connected with Babbages ideas on computation and in 1824 he won its  cited for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables</span>
				<span class='text'>abbages motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation has been a commonplace since  wrote about it in 1834 in the  under Babbages guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>  The context of these developments is still debated</span>
				<span class='text'>Babbages own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Societys wish to improve </span>
				<span class='text'>Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project to recalculate some part of those tables</span>
				<span class='text'>With the results to hand discrepancies were found</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in 1821 or 1822 and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation</span>
				<span class='text'> The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to  who had died in 1820</span>
				<span class='text'>Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern  with his friend  concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the  supplanted by the   in 1839 and 1840</span>

				<span class='text'>They opened up the fields of s including the s fundamental to the difference engine and operator  methods for s</span>
				<span class='text'> The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing Δ to D as a finite difference becomes infinitesimal</span>

				<span class='text'>In essence it was known to  1697</span>

				<span class='text'>Not a conventional resident  and inattentive to teaching he wrote three topical books during this period of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the  in 1832</span>
				<span class='text'>name AAAS  Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues  his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College Cambridge  thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing</span>
				<span class='text'>Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on </span>
				<span class='text'>Babbages orming direction looked to see university education more inclusive universities doing more for research a broader syllabus and more interest in applications but  found the programme unacceptable</span>
				<span class='text'>A controversy Babbage had with  lasted for six years</span>
				<span class='text'> He never did give a lecture</span>
				<span class='text'>name Th35 It was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics</span>

				<span class='text'> He twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of </span>
				<span class='text'>In 1832 he came in third among five candidates missing out by some 500 votes in the two member constituency when two other ormist candidates  and Christopher Temple split the vote</span>

				<span class='text'>One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a campaigning element</span>
				<span class='text'>His Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes 1830 stands out however for its sharp attacks</span>
				<span class='text'>It aimed to improve British science and more particularly to oust  as President of the Royal Society which Babbage wished to orm</span>
				<span class='text'> It was written out of pique when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society as Herschel was the senior but failed because of his antagonism to </span>
				<span class='text'> Michael Faraday had a reply written by  as On the Alleged Decline of Science in England 1831</span>
				<span class='text'>name Holmes  On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact with the bland election of the  to succeed Gilbert the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>As a broad manifesto on the other hand his Decline led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the  BAAS</span>
				<span class='text'>name Holmes The  in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage</span>
				<span class='text'>In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out  writing in the  as another leader with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money</span>
				<span class='text'>In the debate of the period on statistics qua data collection and what is now  the BAAS in its Statistical Section which owed something also to Whewell opted for data collection</span>

				<span class='text'> From An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts 1827 which became the Encyclopædia Metropolitana article of 1829 Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that combined with discussion of factories made up the first part of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>The second part considered the domestic and political economy of manufactures</span>
				<span class='text'>The book sold well and quickly went to a fourth edition 1836</span>
				<span class='text'> Babbage represented his work as largely a result of actual observations in factories British and abroad</span>

				<span class='text'> What Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level</span>
				<span class='text'>If the labour process can be divided among several workers labour costs may be cut by assigning only high skill tasks to high cost workers restricting other tasks to lower paid workers</span>

				<span class='text'>That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality most notably with  the Astronomer Royal</span>
				<span class='text'>name Swade Babbage directed the building of some steam powered machines that achieved some modest success suggesting that calculations could be mechanised</span>
				<span class='text'>For more than ten years he received government funding for his project which amounted to £17000 but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him</span>
				<span class='text'>name Gleick While Babbages machines were mechanical and unwieldy their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer</span>
				<span class='text'>The data and program memory were separated operation was instruction based the control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate  unit</span>
				<span class='text'>name Gleick In Babbages time printed s were calculated by s in other words by hand</span>
				<span class='text'>They were central to navigation science and engineering as well as mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation</span>
				<span class='text'>name Th35 At Cambridge Babbage saw the fallibility of this process and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management</span>
				<span class='text'>His own account of his path towards mechanical computation erences a particular occasionblockquoteIn 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms which he knew to be full of mistakes when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery</span>
				<span class='text'>The French government had produced several tables by a new method</span>
				<span class='text'>Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages and the work itself which was restricted to addition and subtraction was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Here for the first time mass production was applied to arithmetic and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable</span>
				<span class='text'>Faster than Thought Pitman 1953 p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'> blockquoteThere was another period seven years later when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables</span>

				<span class='text'>After the  came to a close scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact in 1819  was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society</span>
				<span class='text'>In works of the 1820s and 1830s Babbage erred in detail to de Pronys project</span>
				<span class='text'> Babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine made to compute values of s</span>
				<span class='text'>It was created to calculate a series of values automatically</span>
				<span class='text'>By using the method of s it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division</span>
				<span class='text'>or a prototype difference engine Babbage brought in  to implement the design in 1823</span>
				<span class='text'>Clement worked to high standards but his s were particularly elaborate</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the standard terms of business of the time he could charge for their construction and would also own them</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831</span>
				<span class='text'>Some parts of the prototype survive in the </span>
				<span class='text'> This prototype evolved into the first difference engine</span>
				<span class='text'>It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the Science Museum in London</span>
				<span class='text'>This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25000 parts weigh fifteen  13600ampnbspkg and would have been  tall</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Babbage received ample funding for the project it was never completed</span>
				<span class='text'>He later 1847–1849 produced detailed drawings for an improved versionDifference Engine No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 but did not receive funding from the British government</span>
				<span class='text'>His design was finally constructed in 1989–1991 using his plans and 19th century manufacturing tolerances</span>
				<span class='text'>It performed its first calculation at the London Science Museum returning results to 31 digits</span>
				<span class='text'>ine years later the Science Museum completed the  Babbage had designed for the difference engine</span>

				<span class='text'>name CollierMacLachlan2000  The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fully fledged general purpose computation</span>
				<span class='text'>It is largely on it that Babbages standing as computer pioneer rests</span>
				<span class='text'>The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using s the Engine was intended to use loops of  punched cards to control a mechanical calculator which could use as input the results of preceding computations</span>

				<span class='text'>In 2011 researchers in Britain embarked on a multimillion pound project Plan 28 to construct Babbages Analytical Engine</span>
				<span class='text'> Since Babbages plans were continually being ined and were never completed they intended to engage the public in the project and  the analysis of what should be built</span>
				<span class='text'> It would have the equivalent of 675 bytes of memory and run at a clock speed of about 7ampnbspHz</span>
