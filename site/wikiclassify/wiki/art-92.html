				<span class='text'>His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery</span>
				<span class='text'>The French government had produced several tables by a new method</span>
				<span class='text'>Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable</span>
