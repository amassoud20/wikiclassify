				<span class='text'>He accepted the invitation, and assumed responsibility for the Bureau's inquiry into the role of money in the [[business cycle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he initiated the &quot;Workshop in Money and Banking&quot; (the &quot;Chicago Workshop&quot;), which promoted a revival of monetary studies</span>
				<span class='text'>During the latter half of the 1940s, Friedman began a collaboration with Anna Schwartz, an [[Economic history|economic historian]] at the Bureau, that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co-authored by Friedman and Schwartz, ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867‚Äì1960''</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Richard Kahn, Baron Kahn|Richard Kahn]]) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by [[Dennis Robertson (economist)|Dennis Robertson]])</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Monetarism]] is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Its origins can be traced back to the 16th-century [[School of Salamanca#Money, value, and price|School of Salamanca]] or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization</span>
				<span class='text'>He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867‚Äì1960'' (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and [[economy of the United States|economic activity]] in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>history</span>
				<span class='text'>A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations</span>
				<span class='text'>Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output</span>
				<span class='text'>These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level</span>
				<span class='text'>riedman was the main proponent of the [[monetarism|monetarist]] school of economics</span>
				<span class='text'>He maintained that there is a close and stable association between [[inflation]] and the money supply, mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the [[Monetary Base|monetary base's]] growth rate</span>
				<span class='text'>He famously used the analogy of &quot;dropping money out of a helicopter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Optimum Quantity of Money |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1969 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would overcomplicate his models</span>
				<span class='text'>riedman's arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of [[Cost-push inflation]], that the increased [[Price Level|General Price Level]] at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil, or increases in wages; as he wrote, {{quote|Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Friedman rejected the use of [[fiscal policy]] as a tool of [[demand]] management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely</span>
				<span class='text'>Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the [[Great Contraction]], arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial [[shock (economics)|shock]] whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve</span>
				<span class='text'>{quote|The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of using its powers to offset the depression, it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from 1929 to 1933&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system, it was a tragic failure of government</span>

				<span class='text'>His close friend [[George Stigler]] explained, &quot;As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the [[Rational expectations|theory of rational expectations]], a newer approach developed by [[Robert Lucas, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Lucas]], also at the University of Chicago</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memoirs of an Unregulated Economist |first=Milton |last=Friedman |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1969 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Friedman and Lucas, or [[new classical macroeconomics]] as a whole, was highly complex</span>
				<span class='text'>The Friedmanian [[Phillips curve]] was an interesting starting point for Lucas, but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory</span>
				<span class='text'>Lucas elaborated a new approach in which [[rational expectations]] were presumed instead of the Friedmanian [[adaptive expectations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to this reformulation, the story in which the theory of the new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed</span>
				<span class='text'>This modification, however, had a significant effect on Friedman‚Äôs own approach, so, as a result, the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed</span>

				<span class='text'>df}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between Friedmanian [[monetarism]] and new classical macroeconomics</span>
				<span class='text'>riedman was also known for his work on the consumption function, the [[permanent income hypothesis]] (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Charlie Rose Show |airdate=December 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income</span>
				<span class='text'>Windfall gains would mostly be saved</span>
				<span class='text'>Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances</span>
				<span class='text'>Other important contributions include his critique of the [[Phillips curve]] and the concept of the [[natural rate of unemployment]] (1968)</span>
				<span class='text'>This critique associated his name, together with that of [[Edmund Phelps]], with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so</span>
				<span class='text'>Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market</span>
				<span class='text'>riedman's essay &quot;[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]]&quot; (1953) provided the [[epistemological]] pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the Chicago School</span>
				<span class='text'>There he argued that economics as ''science'' should be free of value judgments for it to be objective</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction</span>
				<span class='text'>That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'</span>
				<span class='text'>His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Leonard Savage]], and [[Ronald Fisher]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Friedman did statistical work at the Division of War Research at Columbia, where he and his colleagues came up with the technique</span>
				<span class='text'>It later became, in the words of ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', &quot;the standard analysis of quality control inspection&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The dictionary adds, &quot;Like many of Friedman‚Äôs contributions, in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control; that however is a measure of his genius</span>
