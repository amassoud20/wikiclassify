				<span class='text'>Arthur was a research chemist who encouraged Irving to be curious about nature and how things work</span>
				<span class='text'>Arthur helped Irving set up his first chemistry lab in the corner of his bedroom, and he was content to answer the myriad of questions that Irving would pose</span>
				<span class='text'>Langmuir's [[hobby|hobbies]] included [[mountaineering]], [[skiing]], [[pilot (aircraft)|piloting]] his own plane, and [[classical music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--listening to or playing it?--&gt; In addition to his professional interest in the politics of atomic energy, he was concerned about wilderness conservation</span>
				<span class='text'>==Education===Langmuir attended his early education at various schools and institutes in America and Paris (1892‚Äì1895)</span>
				<span class='text'>Langmuir graduated high school from [[Chestnut Hill Academy]] (1898), an elite private school located in the affluent [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]] area in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in [[metallurgical engineering]] ([[Metallurgy|Met</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]) from the [[Columbia University School of Mines]] (the first mining and metallurgy school in the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> established,1864 and presently known as [[Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]]) in 1903</span>
				<span class='text'>He earned his Ph</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>degree in 1906 under Nobel laureate [[Walther Nernst]] in [[G√∂ttingen]], for research done using the &quot;[[Nernst glower]]&quot;, an electric lamp invented by Nernst</span>
				<span class='text'>His doctoral thesis was entitled ‚ÄúOn the Partial Recombination of Dissolved Gases During Cooling</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù He later did postgraduate work in chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>Langmuir then taught at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], until 1909, when he began working at the [[General Electric]] research laboratory ([[Schenectady, New York]])</span>
				<span class='text'>==Research===[[Image:Irving Langmuir and Guglielmo Marconi in lab</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>work)</span>
				<span class='text'>His first major development was the improvement of the [[diffusion pump]], which ultimately led to the invention of the high-vacuum rectifier and amplifier tubes</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, he and colleague [[Lewi Tonks]] discovered that the lifetime of a [[tungsten]] filament could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an [[inert gas]], such as [[argon]], the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process</span>
				<span class='text'>He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>These were important developments in the history of the [[incandescent light bulb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work in surface chemistry began at this point, when he discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coffey|2008|pp=64‚Äì70}}&lt;/ref&gt;His assistant in vacuum tube research was his cousin [[William Comings White]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He was one of the first scientists to work with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s and was the first to call these ionized gases by that name, because they reminded him of [[blood plasma]]</span>

				<span class='text'>e introduced the concept of [[Plasma (physics)#Temperatures|electron temperature]] and in 1924 invented the diagnostic method for measuring both temperature and [[Plasma (physics)#Degree of ionization|density]] with an electrostatic probe, now called a [[Langmuir probe]] and commonly used in plasma physics</span>
				<span class='text'>The current of a biased probe tip is measured as a function of bias voltage to determine the local plasma temperature and density</span>
				<span class='text'>He also discovered atomic [[hydrogen]], which he put to use by inventing the [[atomic hydrogen welding]] process; the first plasma weld ever made</span>
				<span class='text'>Plasma welding has since been developed into [[gas tungsten arc welding]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1917, he published a paper on the chemistry of oil films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Constitution and Fundamental Properties of Solids and Liquids: II</span>

				<span class='text'>Langmuir theorized that oils consisting of an [[aliphatic]] chain with a [[hydrophilic]] end group (perhaps an [[alcohol]] or [[acid]]) were oriented as a film one-molecule thick upon the surface of water, with the hydrophilic group down in the water and the [[hydrophobic]] chains clumped together on the surface</span>
				<span class='text'>The thickness of the film could be easily determined from the known volume and area of the oil, which allowed investigation of the molecular configuration before [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques were available</span>

				<span class='text'>Langmuir estimated the fly's true speed at 25 miles per hour</span>
				<span class='text'>fter observing [[windrow]]s of drifting seaweed in the [[Sargasso Sea]] he discovered a wind-driven surface circulation in the sea</span>
				<span class='text'>It is now called the [[Langmuir circulation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Irving Langmuir House 2008</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Langmuir's house in Schenectady]]During [[World War II]], Langmuir worked on improving naval [[sonar]] for submarine detection, and later to develop protective smoke screens and methods for [[deicing]] aircraft wings</span>
				<span class='text'>This research led him to theorize that the introduction of [[dry ice]] and [[iodide]] into a sufficiently moist cloud of low temperature could induce precipitation ([[cloud seeding]]); though in frequent practice, particularly in Australia and the People's Republic of China, the efficiency of this technique remains controversial today</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1953 Langmuir coined the term &quot;[[pathological science]]&quot;, describing research conducted with accordance to the [[scientific method]], but tainted by unconscious bias or subjective effects</span>
				<span class='text'>This is in contrast to [[pseudoscience]], which has no pretense of following the scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>In his original speech, he presented [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] and [[flying saucers]] as examples of pathological science; since then, the label has been applied to [[polywater]] and [[cold fusion]]</span>
