				<span class='text'>==Continental and Medici politics===[[Francis I of France]]'s conquest of Milan in 1524, during his [[Italian campaign of 1524–1525]], prompted the Pope to quit the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]]–Spanish side and to ally himself with other Italian princes, including the [[Republic of Venice]], and France in the January of 1525</span>
				<span class='text'>This treaty granted the definitive acquisition of [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] for the [[Papal States]], the rule of Medici over Florence and the free passage of the French troops to [[Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This policy in itself was sound and patriotic, but Clement VII's zeal soon cooled; by his want of foresight and unseasonable economy, he laid himself open to an attack from the turbulent Roman barons, which obliged him to invoke the mediation of the emperor, Charles V</span>
				<span class='text'>One month later, however, Francis I was crushed and imprisoned in the [[Battle of Pavia]], and Clement VII veered back to his former engagements with Charles V, signing an alliance with the [[Charles de Lannoy|viceroy of Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ut he was to change sides again when Francis I was freed after the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)]]: the Pope entered into the [[League of Cognac]] together with France, [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], and [[Francesco II Sforza]] of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Clement VII issued an invective against Charles V, who in reply defined him a &quot;wolf&quot; instead of a &quot;shepherd&quot;, menacing the summoning of a council about the [[Lutheran]] question</span>
				<span class='text'>ike his cousin Pope Leo X, Clement was considered too generous to his Medici relatives, draining the Vatican treasuries</span>

				<span class='text'>The humiliated Pope promised therefore to bring the Papal States to the Imperial side again</span>
				<span class='text'>But soon after, Colonna left the siege and went to Naples, not keeping his promises and dismissing the Cardinal from his charge</span>
				<span class='text'>From this point on, Clement VII could do nothing but follow the fate of the French party to the end</span>

				<span class='text'>Clement VII, who had displayed no more resolution in his military than in his political conduct, was shortly afterwards (6 June) obliged to surrender himself together with the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], where he had taken refuge</span>
				<span class='text'>He agreed to pay a ransom of 400,000 [[ducato (coin)|ducati]] in exchange for his life; conditions included the cession of [[Parma]], [[Piacenza]], [[Civitavecchia]], and [[Modena]] to the Holy Roman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>(Only the last could be occupied in fact</span>

				<span class='text'>After having bought off some Imperial officers, he escaped disguised as a peddler and took shelter in [[Orvieto]] and then in [[Viterbo]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n June of the next year the warring parties signed the [[Peace of Barcelona]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Papal States regained some cities, and Charles V agreed to restore the Medici to power in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1530, after an eleven-month [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|siege]], the Tuscan city capitulated, and Clement VII installed his illegitimate nephew [[Alessandro de Medici|Alessandro]] as duke</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently the Pope followed a policy of subservience to the emperor, endeavouring on the one hand to induce him to act with severity against the Lutherans in Germany and on the other to avoid his demands for a general council</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1527 Henry asked Pope Clement to annul the marriage, but the Pope refused</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Catholic teaching, a validly contracted marriage is indivisible until death, and thus the pope cannot annul a marriage on the basis of a [[canonical impediment]] previously [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many people close to Henry wished simply to ignore the Pope; but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that the English Parliament could not empower the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] to act against the Pope's prohibition</span>
				<span class='text'>In Parliament, Bishop [[John Fisher]] was the Pope's champion</span>

				<span class='text'>The Pope granted the [[papal bull]]s necessary for Cranmer’s promotion to Canterbury, as he also demanded that Cranmer take an oath of allegiance to the pope before his consecration</span>
				<span class='text'>Laws made under Henry already declared that bishops would be consecrated even without papal approval</span>

				<span class='text'>119-121)&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment&lt;ref&gt;Cranmer, in a letter, describes it as a ''divorce'', but it was clearly not a dissolution of a marriage in the modern sense but the annulment of a marriage which was said to be defective on the grounds of affinity—Catherine was his deceased brother's widow</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required</span>
				<span class='text'>The Pope responded to the marriage by [[Excommunication#The Catholic Church|excommunicating]] both Henry and Cranmer from the Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>onsequently, in England, in the same year, the Act of First Fruits and Tenths transferred the taxes on ecclesiastical income from the Pope to the English Crown</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|Peter's Pence Act]] outlawed the annual payment by landowners of [[Peter's Pence|one penny]] to the Pope</span>

				<span class='text'>This was a violation of Catholic canon law, which required priests to be clean-shaven; however, it had the precedent of the beard which [[Pope Julius II]] had worn for nine months in 1511–12 as a similar sign of mourning for the loss of the papal city of [[Bologna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nlike Julius II, however, Clement VII kept his beard until his death in 1534</span>
				<span class='text'>His example in wearing a beard was followed by his successor, [[Paul III]], and indeed by twenty-four popes who followed him, down to [[Innocent XII]], who died in 1700</span>
