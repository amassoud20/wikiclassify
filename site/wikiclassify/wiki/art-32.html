				<span class='text'>haarij ah bin Zaid Ansari used to live at Sunh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there</span>
				<span class='text'>After Abu Bakr's family arrived in Medina he bought another house near Muhammad's</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The climate of Mecca was dry, but the climate of Medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family</span>
				<span class='text'>At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a wholesaler, and had his store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon his business flourished at Medina</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter [[Aisha]], who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthened the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Maghazi&quot;/&gt;==Military campaigns under Muhammad=={{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}===Battle of Badr and Uhud==={{Main|Battle of Badr|Battle of Uhud}}In 624 Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the [[Battle of Badr]], but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent</span>
				<span class='text'>In 625 he participated in the [[Battle of Uhud]] which ended in a rout by the majority of the Muslims</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the battle begun, Abu Bakr's son [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]], who was still non-Muslim and was fighting from the side of the Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad</span>
				<span class='text'>His son later converted to [[Islam]] and gained fame during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] as a fierce warrior</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second phase of the battle, [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]’s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>Many Muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war</span>
				<span class='text'>So did Abu Bakr, however, he was among the first to return according to few [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Hadith</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]], [[Talhah]] and a few other Muslims remained guarding Muhammad from the attacks of the Quraysh soldiers, majority of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and many Sunni Hadith agree to this</span>
				<span class='text'>Criticisms of his lacklustre military achievements in comparison with the extremely accomplished Ali should be put into context: Abu Bakr was a middle aged man during these battles, was not a soldier but a merchant by trade, and had never seen battle before – it may thus be unfair to directly compare him with Ali in this regard</span>
				<span class='text'>owever it is related that once [[Ali]] asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men</span>
				<span class='text'>Everyone replied that Ali was the bravest of all men</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereupon Ali said:{{quote|No</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu Bakr is the bravest of men</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Battle of Badr]] we had prepared a pavillion for the prophet, but when we were asked to offer ourselves for the task of guarding it none came forward except Abu Bakr</span>
				<span class='text'>With a drawn sword he took his stand by the side of Prophet of Allah and guarded him from the infidels by attacking those who dared to proceed in that direction</span>

				<span class='text'>There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover</span>
				<span class='text'>Muhammad stood firm</span>
				<span class='text'>There were only nine companions around him including Abu Bakr</span>
				<span class='text'>All the rest had fled</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the instructions of Muhammad, Abbas shouted at the top of his voice &quot;O Muslims come to the Prophet of Allah&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Muslim had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to [[Autas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas</span>
				<span class='text'>In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught</span>
				<span class='text'>Finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to Ta'if</span>
				<span class='text'>bu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta'if</span>
				<span class='text'>From Autas the Muslim forces set out for Ta'if</span>
				<span class='text'>The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town, but this did not lead to any tangible results</span>
				<span class='text'>The Muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate</span>
				<span class='text'>The enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective</span>

				<span class='text'>MASUD-UL-HASAN PAGE 47, 48&lt;/ref&gt;===Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj===In 631 AD, Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the [[Hajj]] according to the new Islamic way</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu Bakr had thus the honour of being the First Amir-ul-Hajj in the history of [[Islam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ome time after Abu Bakr and his party had left for Hajj, Muhammad received  a revelation about the regulation of the Hajj, and the ordering of relationships with the infidels</span>
				<span class='text'>It is related that when this revelation came, some one suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr</span>
				<span class='text'>Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation</span>
				<span class='text'>uhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr</span>
				<span class='text'>When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them</span>
				<span class='text'>Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad</span>
				<span class='text'>t Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad</span>
				<span class='text'>The main points of the proclamation were:#Henceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the [[Kaaba]] or perform the pilgrimage</span>
				<span class='text'>No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Polytheism]] was not to be tolerated</span>
				<span class='text'>Where the Muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods</span>
				<span class='text'>Where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in [[Arabia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Henceforward Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia</span>
				<span class='text'>n some quarters an argument is advanced that as on this occasion the proclamation was read by [[Ali]] on behalf of [[Muhammad]], this establishes the precedence of Ali over Abu Bakr, and that therefore when after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr became the [[Caliph]] in disregard of the claims of Ali, he was a usurper</span>
				<span class='text'>n this occasion Ali did not replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj</span>
				<span class='text'>Ali was merely assigned a special mission to read the proclamation as according to Muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation</span>
				<span class='text'>We can thus say that on this occasion Abu Bakr represented the temporal side, while Ali represented the spiritual side</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of Muhammad there was no longer the question of any spiritual representation; the issue was only temporal representation, and for this Abu Bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented Muhammad even in his lifetime</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; The companions were astonished by this (they wondered why Abu Bakr wept), and the people said, &quot;Look at this old man! Allah's Apostle talks about a [[Abdullah (name)|Slave of Allah]] to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says &quot;our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant, as Abu Bakr later told the companions</span>
				<span class='text'>uhammad continued:&lt;blockquote&gt;No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth</span>

				<span class='text'>When [[Muhammad#Farewell pilgrimage and death|Muhammad died]] Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs</span>
				<span class='text'>Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife</span>
				<span class='text'>He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha</span>
				<span class='text'>He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth)</span>
				<span class='text'>He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you</span>

				<span class='text'>]According to [[Sunni Islam]], Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the ''Qur'an'' in written form</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama fought in 632, Umar (the later Caliph Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the ''Qur'an'' ( about 300 to 700) had died in battle</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing that the Qur'an may be lost or corrupted, Umar requested the Caliph Abu Bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format</span>
				<span class='text'>After initial hesitation, Abu Bakr made a committee headed by [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] which included the memorizers of the ''Qur'an'' and Umar and to collect all verses of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>After collecting all Qur'anic verses from texts in the possession of various [[sahaba]], [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the ''Qur'an''</span>
				<span class='text'>After they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down, the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in codex form to the Caliph Abu Bakr</span>
				<span class='text'>It is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of Muhammad when most of his [[sahaba]] (Companions) were still alive</span>
				<span class='text'>rior to his death, Abu Bakr gave this authorized copy of the ''Qur'an'' to Umar – his successor as caliph</span>
				<span class='text'>It remained with him throughout his tenure as caliph (10 years)</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to his death, Umar gave this book to his daughter [[Hafsa bint Umar]], who was one of the wives of Muhammad</span>
				<span class='text'>Umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed, and thus preferred to leave this copy with Hafsa so as not to indicate his personal preference of who would be the next caliph</span>
				<span class='text'>Later on, it became the basis of [[Uthman Ibn Affan]]'s definitive text of the ''Qur'an'' which was published far and wide merely 18 years after the death of Muhammad</span>

We acknowledge your superiority</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Then he (i</span>

				<span class='text'> Then &quot;Aisha said to them, 'Didn't Allah's Apostle say, Our (Apostles') property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of [[Ali]] and Fatima</span>

				<span class='text'>The Twelver Shi'a strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the ''Qur'an'', claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-islam</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Jafar al-Sadiq]] disapproved of people who said anything bad about his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]], the largest group amongst the Shia before the [[Safavid Dynasty]] and currently the second largest group, believe that on the last hour of [[Zayd ibn Ali]] (the uncle of [[Jafar al-Sadiq]]), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: &quot;May God have mercy on you! What do you have to say on the matter of Abu Bakr and [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]?&quot; [[Zayd ibn Ali]] said, &quot;I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them</span>
