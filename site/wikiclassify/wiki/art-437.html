				<span class='text'>=Personal life=====Early years===Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac was born at his parents' home in [[Bristol]], England, on 8 August 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in the [[Bishopston, Bristol|Bishopston]] area of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac, was an immigrant from [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland]], who worked in Bristol as a French teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Florence Hannah Dirac, {{née}} Holten, the daughter of a ship's captain, was born in Cornwall, England, and worked as a librarian at the [[Bristol Central Library]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul had a younger sister, Béatrice Isabelle Marguerite, known as Betty, and an older brother, Reginald Charles Félix, known as Felix,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who committed suicide in March 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirac later recalled: &quot;My parents were terribly distressed</span>
				<span class='text'>I didn't know they cared so much [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I never knew that parents were supposed to care for their children, but from then on I knew</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;Charles and the children were officially Swiss nationals until they became [[naturalised]] on 22 October 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirac's father was strict and authoritarian, although he disapproved of corporal punishment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirac had a strained relationship with his father, so much so that after his father's death, Dirac wrote, &quot;I feel much freer now, and I am my own man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Charles forced his children to speak to him only in French, in order that they learn the language</span>
				<span class='text'>When Dirac found that he could not express what he wanted to say in French, he chose to remain silent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra|1972|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Education===Dirac was educated first at [[Bishop Road Primary School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then at the all-boys [[Society of Merchant Venturers|Merchant Venturers']] Technical College (later [[Cotham School]]), where his father was a French teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was an institution attached to the [[University of Bristol]], which shared grounds and staff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mehra18&quot;/&gt; It emphasised technical subjects like bricklaying, shoemaking and metal work, and modern languages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual at a time when secondary education in Britain was still dedicated largely to the classics, and something for which Dirac would later express gratitude</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Mehra18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra|1972|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;Dirac studied [[electrical engineering]] on a City of Bristol University Scholarship at the [[University of Bristol]]'s engineering faculty, which was co-located with the Merchant Venturers' Technical College</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he completed his degree in 1921, he sat the entrance examination for [[St John's College, Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He passed, and was awarded a £70 scholarship, but this fell short of the amount of money required to live and study at Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his having graduated with a [[first class honours]] Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, the economic climate of the [[Post–World War I recession|post-war depression]] was such that he was unable to find work as an engineer</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead he took up an offer to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics at the University of Bristol free of charge</span>
				<span class='text'>He was permitted to skip the first year of the course owing to his engineering degree</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1923, Dirac graduated, once again with first class honours, and received a £140 scholarship from the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his £70 scholarship from St John's College, this was enough to live at Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>There, Dirac pursued his interests in the theory of [[general relativity]], an interest he had gained earlier as a student in Bristol, and in the nascent field of [[quantum physics]], under the supervision of [[Ralph Fowler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925 to 1928 he held an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;1851 Royal Commission Archives&quot;&gt;1851 Royal Commission Archives&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his PhD in June 1926 with the first thesis on quantum mechanics to be submitted anywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then continued his research in Copenhagen and Göttingen</span>

				<span class='text'>Paul and Margit Dirac had two children together, both daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Florence Monica</span>

				<span class='text'>Dirac published eleven papers during the period 1939–46</span>

				<span class='text'>The two are incompatible</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra|1972|pp=17–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;Dirac himself wrote in his diary during his postgraduate years that he concentrated solely on his research, and stopped only on Sunday, when he took long strolls alone</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Both still in their twenties, and unmarried, they made an odd couple</span>
				<span class='text'>Heisenberg was a ladies' man who constantly flirted and danced, while Dirac—'an Edwardian geek', as biographer Graham Farmelo puts it—suffered agonies if forced into any kind of socialising or small talk</span>
				<span class='text'>'Why do you dance?' Dirac asked his companion</span>
				<span class='text'>'When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure,' Heisenberg replied</span>
				<span class='text'>Dirac pondered this notion, then blurted out: 'But, Heisenberg, how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mckie&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>Noticing the visitor's surprise at seeing an attractive woman in the house, Dirac said, &quot;This is</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>this is Wigner's sister&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Margit Dirac told both [[George Gamow]] and Anton Capri in the 1960s that her husband had actually said, &quot;Allow me to present Wigner's sister, who is now my wife</span>

				<span class='text'>Do you have one too?&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zee|2010|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;After he presented a lecture at a conference, one colleague raised his hand and said &quot;I don't understand the equation on the top-right-hand corner of the blackboard&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After a long silence, the moderator asked Dirac if he wanted to answer the question, to which Dirac replied &quot;That was not a question, it was a comment</span>

				<span class='text'>Most physicists speak of [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] for half-integer-spin particles and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] for integer-spin particles</span>
				<span class='text'>While lecturing later in life, Dirac always insisted on calling the former &quot;Fermi statistics&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Dirac's contribution was a criticism of the political purpose of religion, which was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr when Heisenberg reported it to him later</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other things, Dirac said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion</span>
				<span class='text'>If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality</span>
				<span class='text'>The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling</span>
				<span class='text'>But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way</span>
				<span class='text'>What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented</span>
				<span class='text'>If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet</span>
				<span class='text'>Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones</span>
				<span class='text'>They are also much easier to exploit</span>
				<span class='text'>Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly</span>
				<span class='text'>That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Heisenberg's view was tolerant</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: &quot;Well, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is 'There is no God and Paul Dirac is His prophet</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=138}}, who says this was an old joke, pointing out in a footnote that [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] wrote in the 1850s that &quot;There is no God, and [[Harriet Martineau]] is her prophet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Later in life, Dirac's views towards the idea of God were less acerbic</span>
				<span class='text'> As an author of an article appearing in the May 1963 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Dirac wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a [[mathematical theory of great beauty]] and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it</span>
				<span class='text'>You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed</span>
				<span class='text'>We simply have to accept it</span>
				<span class='text'>One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirac: A Scientific Biography|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521380898|pages=256–257|author=Helge Kragh|chapter=The purest soul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirac explained that the existence of God could only be justified if an improbable event were to have taken place in the past:&lt;blockquote&gt;It could be that it is extremely difficult to start life</span>
				<span class='text'>It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>et us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10^-100</span>
				<span class='text'>I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>Under those conditions</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t is almost certain that life would not have started</span>
				<span class='text'>And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life</span>
				<span class='text'>I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kragh /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dirac did not commend himself to any definite view, but he described the possibilities for answering the question of God in a scientific manner</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=414–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Career==Dirac established the most general theory of quantum mechanics and discovered the relativistic equation for the electron, which now bears his name</span>
				<span class='text'>The remarkable notion of an antiparticle to each fermion particle – e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the positron as antiparticle to the electron – stems from his equation</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first to develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or &quot;elementary&quot; particles today, work that is fundamental to our understanding of the forces of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed and investigated the concept of a [[magnetic monopole]], an object not yet known empirically, as a means of bringing even greater symmetry to [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations of [[electromagnetism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Gravity===He quantised the gravitational field, and developed a general theory of [[quantum field]] theories with dynamical constraints, which forms the basis of the [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] and [[Superstring theory|superstring theories]] of today</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence and importance of his work has increased with the decades, and physicists daily use the concepts and equations that he developed</span>
				<span class='text'>==Quantum theory===Dirac's first step into a new quantum theory was taken late in September 1925</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ralph Fowler]], his research supervisor, had received a proof copy of an [[Über quantentheoretischer Umdeutung|exploratory paper]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the framework of the old quantum theory of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]], which leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities</span>
				<span class='text'>Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking him to look into this paper carefully</span>
				<span class='text'>irac's attention was drawn to a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached</span>
				<span class='text'>Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the Poisson Brackets that occur in the classical dynamics of particle motion</span>
				<span class='text'>From this thought he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables</span>
				<span class='text'>This led him to a more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Dirac: a genius in the history of physics|url=http://cerncourier</span>
				<span class='text'>om/cws/article/cern/28693|work=Cern Courier|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Dirac noticed an analogy between the [[Poisson bracket]]s of [[classical mechanics]] and the recently proposed quantisation rules in [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics|matrix formulation]] of quantum mechanics</span>
				<span class='text'>This observation allowed Dirac to obtain the [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]] rules in a [[Canonical quantization|novel and more illuminating manner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For this work, published in 1926, he received a PhD from Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>irac was famously not bothered by [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|issues of interpretation in quantum theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In fact, in a paper published in a book in his honor, he wrote: &quot;The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here</span>

				<span class='text'>Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of [[Spin (physics)|quantum spin]] as a relativistic phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>he necessity of [[fermion]]s (matter being created and destroyed in [[Enrico Fermi]]'s 1934 theory of [[beta decay]]), however, led to a reinterpretation of Dirac's equation as a &quot;classical&quot; [[field equation]] for any [[point particle]] of spin ''[[Planck constant|ħ]]''/2, itself subject to quantisation conditions involving [[Anticommutativity|anti-commutators]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus reinterpreted, in 1934 by [[Werner Heisenberg]], as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing all elementary matter particles – today [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s – this [[Dirac field]] equation is as central to theoretical physics as the [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell]], [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] and [[General relativity|Einstein]] field equations</span>
				<span class='text'>Dirac is regarded as the founder of [[quantum electrodynamics]], being the first to use that term</span>
				<span class='text'>He also introduced the idea of [[vacuum polarization|vacuum polarisation]] in the early 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, and in particular [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] and [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]] in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics</span>
				<span class='text'>irac's ''[[Principles of Quantum Mechanics]]'', published in 1930, is a landmark in the [[history of science]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today</span>
				<span class='text'>In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of [[Werner Heisenberg]] on [[matrix mechanics]] and of [[Erwin Schrödinger]] on [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] into a single mathematical formalism that associates measurable quantities to operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of vectors that describe the state of a [[physical system]]</span>

				<span class='text'>During World War II, he conducted important theoretical and experimental research on [[uranium enrichment]] by [[gas centrifuge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>irac's [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) made predictions that were – more often than not – infinite and therefore unacceptable</span>
				<span class='text'>A workaround known as [[renormalisation]] was developed, but Dirac never accepted this</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation&quot;, he said in 1975, &quot;because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way</span>
				<span class='text'>This is just not sensible mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; His refusal to accept [[renormalisation]] resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, from his once rejected notes he managed to work on putting quantum electrodynamics on &quot;logical foundations&quot; based on [[Hamiltonian formalism]] that he formulated</span>
				<span class='text'>He found a rather novel way of deriving the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] &quot;Schwinger term&quot; and also the [[Lamb shift]], afresh in 1963, using the Heisenberg picture and without using the joining method used by [[Victor Weisskopf|Weisskopf]] and French, and by the two pioneers of modern QED, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That was two years before the Tomonaga–Schwinger–Feynman QED was given formal recognition by an award of the Nobel Prize for physics</span>
				<span class='text'>eisskopf and French (FW) were the first to obtain the correct result for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron</span>

				<span class='text'>n the 1950s in his search for a better QED, Paul Dirac developed the Hamiltonian theory of constraints&lt;ref&gt;Canad J Math 1950 vol 2, 129; 1951 vol 3, 1&lt;/ref&gt; based on lectures that he delivered at the 1949 International Mathematical Congress in Canada</span>

				<span class='text'>he Hamiltonian of constrained systems is one of  Dirac's many masterpieces</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a powerful generalisation of Hamiltonian theory that remains valid for curved spacetime</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1959 he also gave an invited talk on &quot;Energy of the Gravitational Field&quot; at the New York Meeting of the American Physical Society later published in 1959 Phys Rev Lett 2, 368</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1964 he published his ''Lectures on Quantum Mechanics'' (London:Academic) which deals with constrained dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems including quantisation of curved spacetime</span>
