				<span class='text'>Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years</span>
				<span class='text'>Born into [[Ibsen (family)|a merchant family]] connected to the [[Patriciate of Norway|patriciate]] of Skien, his dramas were shaped by his family background</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Templeton&quot;/&gt;His father's financial ruin would have a strong influence on Ibsen's later work; the characters in his plays often mirror his parents, and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family</span>
				<span class='text'>A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Templeton&quot;/&gt;At fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1846, when Ibsen was age 18, a liaison with a servant produced an illegitimate child, whose upbringing Ibsen had to pay for until the boy was in his teens, though Ibsen never saw the boy</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing</span>
				<span class='text'>His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym &quot;Brynjolf Bjarme&quot;, when he was only 22, but it was not performed</span>
				<span class='text'>His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life and writings==He spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing</span>
				<span class='text'>bsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile</span>
				<span class='text'>He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned it was as a noted, but controversial, playwright</span>
				<span class='text'>is next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard</span>

				<span class='text'>''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;With success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the &quot;drama of ideas&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed</span>

				<span class='text'>This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration</span>
				<span class='text'>The pastor had advised her to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him</span>
				<span class='text'>But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis</span>
				<span class='text'>The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}In ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further</span>
				<span class='text'>In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community</span>
				<span class='text'>One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often &quot;right&quot; than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the [[liberalism]] of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving</span>
				<span class='text'>''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''</span>
				<span class='text'>The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''</span>
				<span class='text'>The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[tanning|tannery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows</span>
				<span class='text'>The play ends with his complete ostracism</span>
				<span class='text'>It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor</span>
				<span class='text'>s audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism</span>
				<span class='text'>Always an iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum, including his own</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex</span>
				<span class='text'>It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the &quot;Summons of the Ideal&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child</span>
				<span class='text'>Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary &quot;invention&quot;, his wife is earning the household income</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}Ibsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child</span>
				<span class='text'>Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar</span>
				<span class='text'>Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the &quot;ideal&quot; is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear</span>

				<span class='text'>In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions</span>
				<span class='text'>Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Hedda Gabler'' is probably Ibsen's most performed play,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day</span>
				<span class='text'>''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll's House'' center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character of Nora in ''A Doll's House'', many of today's audiences and theatre critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} feel that Hedda's intensity and drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism on the part of Nora</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment</span>
				<span class='text'>His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society</span>
				<span class='text'>Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life</span>

				<span class='text'>Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them</span>

				<span class='text'>Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish/German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains</span>
				<span class='text'>His biographer [[Henrik Jæger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that &quot;the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry</span>
