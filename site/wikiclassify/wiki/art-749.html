				<span class='text'>He had two siblings, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878)</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Edwin J</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis, was a physician and a stern disciplinarian who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis's mother, Emma Kermott Lewis, died in 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, Edwin Lewis married Isabel Warner, whose company young Lewis apparently enjoyed</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly Lewis—tall, extremely thin, stricken with [[acne]] and somewhat pop-eyed—had trouble gaining friends and pined after various local girls</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 13 he unsuccessfully ran away from home, wanting to become a drummer boy in the [[Spanish–American War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schorer, 3–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In late 1902 Lewis left home for a year at Oberlin Academy (the then-preparatory department of [[Oberlin College]]) to qualify for acceptance by [[Yale University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Oberlin, he developed a religious enthusiasm that waxed and waned for much of his remaining teenage years</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered Yale in 1903 but did not receive his [[bachelor's degree]] until 1908, having taken time off to work at [[Helicon Home Colony]], [[Upton Sinclair]]'s [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]]-living colony in [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]], and to travel to [[Panama]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis's unprepossessing looks, &quot;fresh&quot; country manners and seemingly self-important loquacity made it difficult for him to win and keep friends at Oberlin and Yale</span>
				<span class='text'> He did initiate a few relatively long-lived friendships among students and professors, some of whom recognized his promise as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schorer, 47–136&lt;/ref&gt;==Early career==[[File:Lewis-Sinclair-LOC</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Sinclair Lewis in 1914]]Lewis's earliest published creative work—romantic poetry and short sketches—appeared in the ''Yale Courant'' and the ''[[Yale Literary Magazine]]'', of which he became an editor</span>
				<span class='text'>After graduation Lewis moved from job to job and from place to place in an effort to make ends meet, write fiction for publication and to chase away boredom</span>
				<span class='text'>While working for newspapers and publishing houses (and for a time at the [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]], [[California]] writers' colony), he developed a facility for turning out shallow, popular stories that were purchased by a variety of magazines</span>
				<span class='text'>He also earned money by selling plots to [[Jack London]], including one for the latter's unfinished novel ''[[The Assassination Bureau, Ltd]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>ewis's first published book was ''Hike and the Aeroplane'', a [[Tom Swift]]-style [[potboiler]] that appeared in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham</span>
				<span class='text'>inclair Lewis's first serious novel, ''[[Our Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Wrenn|Our Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man]]'', appeared in 1914, followed by ''[[The Trail of the Hawk|The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life]]'' (1915) and ''[[The Job (1917 novel)|The Job]]'' (1917)</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year also saw the publication of another potboiler, ''[[The Innocents: A Story for Lovers]]'', an expanded version of a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] story that had originally appeared in ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Free Air]]'', another refurbished serial story, was published in 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>=Marriage and family==In 1914 Lewis married Grace Livingston Hegger (1887–1981), an editor at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>They had one son, Wells Lewis (1917–1944), named after British author [[H</span>

				<span class='text'>As early as 1916, he began taking notes for a realistic novel about small-town life</span>

				<span class='text'>In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and other contemporaries, but also lamented that &quot;in America most of us—not readers alone, but even writers—are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,&quot; and that America is &quot;the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today</span>
