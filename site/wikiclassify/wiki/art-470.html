				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most-[[fête]]d playwright in the dramatic competitions of the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] that took place during the religious festivals of the [[Lenaea]] and the [[City Dionysia|Dionysia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He competed in 30 competitions, won 18, and was never judged lower than second place</span>
				<span class='text'>Aeschylus won 14 competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles, while Euripides won 5  competitions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature [[Oedipus]] and also [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]: they are generally known as the [[Three Theban plays|Theban plays]], although each play was actually a part of a different [[tetralogy]], the other members of which are now lost</span>
				<span class='text'>Sophocles influenced the development of the drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in the presentation of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also [[Character arc|developed his characters]] to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|A marble relief of a poet, perhaps Sophocles]]Sophocles, the son of Sophilus, was a wealthy member of the rural ''[[deme]]'' (small community) of [[Hippeios Colonus]] in [[Attica]], which was to become a setting for one of his plays, and he was probably born there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sfrxi&gt;Sommerstein (2007), p</span>
				<span class='text'>xi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Sophocles was born a few years before the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC: the exact year is unclear, although 497/6 is the most likely</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Sophocles was born into a wealthy family (his father was an armour manufacturer) and was highly educated</span>
				<span class='text'>Sophocles' first artistic triumph was in 468 BC, when he took first prize in the [[Dionysia]] theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama, [[Aeschylus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>246</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plutarch]], the victory came under unusual circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of following the usual custom of choosing judges by lot, the archon asked [[Cimon]] and the other ''[[strategoi]]'' present to decide the victor of the contest</span>
				<span class='text'>Plutarch further contends that following this loss Aeschylus soon left for Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Life of Cimon'' 8</span>
				<span class='text'>Plutarch is mistaken about Aeschylus' death during this trip; he went on to produce dramas in Athens for another decade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Plutarch says that this was Sophocles' first production, it is now thought that his first production was probably in 470 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sfrxi/&gt; ''Triptolemus'' was probably one of the plays that Sophocles presented at this festival</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sfrxi/&gt;In 480 BC Sophocles was chosen to lead the [[paean]] (a choral chant to a god), celebrating the Greek victory over the [[Persian people|Persians]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, the politician [[Cimon]] might have been one of his patrons, although if he was, there was no ill will borne by [[Pericles]], [[Cimon]]'s rival, when Cimon was ostracized in 461 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt; In 443/2 he served as one of the ''[[Hellenotamiai]]'', or treasurers of Athena, helping to manage the finances of the city during the political ascendancy of Pericles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt; According to the ''Vita Sophoclis'', in 441 BC he was elected one of the ten generals,  executive officials at Athens, as a junior colleague of Pericles, and he served in the Athenian campaign against [[Samos]]; he was supposed to have been elected to this position as the result of his production of ''Antigone''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 420 BC, he welcomed and set up an altar for the image of [[Asclepius]] at his house, when the deity was introduced to Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>For this, he was given the posthumous epithet ''Dexion'' (receiver) by the Athenians</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was also elected, in 413 BC, one of the commissioners (''[[probouloi]]'') who responded to the catastrophic destruction of the Athenian expeditionary force in [[Sicily]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>12–13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Sophocles died at the age of ninety or ninety-one in the winter of 406/5 BC, having seen within his lifetime both the Greek triumph in the [[Persian Wars]] and the bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt; As with many famous men in classical antiquity, his death inspired a number of apocryphal stories</span>
				<span class='text'>The most famous is the suggestion that he died from the strain of trying to recite a long sentence from his ''Antigone'' without pausing to take a breath</span>
				<span class='text'>Another account suggests he choked while eating grapes at the [[Anthesteria]] festival in Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>A third holds that he died of happiness after winning his final victory at the City Dionysia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schultz 1835, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>150–1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, a comic poet, in a play titled ''The Muses'', wrote this eulogy: &quot;Blessed is Sophocles, who had a long life, was a man both happy and talented, and the writer of many good tragedies; and he ended his life well without suffering any misfortune</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas 1964, p</span>
				<span class='text'>128</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts, however, his own sons tried to have him declared incompetent near the end of his life; he is said to have refuted their charge in court by reading from his as yet unproduced ''Oedipus at Colonus''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] recounts this story in his ''De Senectute'' 7</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One of his sons, [[Iophon]], and a grandson, also called Sophocles, also became playwrights</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Portrait of the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[actor]] Euiaon in Sophocles' ''Andromeda'', c</span>
				<span class='text'>430 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>]Among Sophocles' earliest innovations was the addition of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F247/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], who dominated [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] playwriting during Sophocles' early career, followed suit and adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F247/&gt; Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of ''skenographia'', or scenery-painting</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt;Thereafter, Sophocles emerged victorious in dramatic competitions at 18 [[Dionysia]] and 6 [[Lenaia]] festivals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt; In addition to innovations in [[dramatic structure]], Sophocles' work is also known for its deeper development of characters than earlier playwrights</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F247/&gt; His reputation was such that foreign rulers invited him to attend their courts, although unlike Aeschylus who died in [[Sicily]], or Euripides who spent time in [[Macedon]], Sophocles never accepted any of these invitations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S41/&gt; [[Aristotle]] used Sophocles'  ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c</span>
				<span class='text'>335 BC) as an example of the highest achievement in [[tragedy]], which suggests the high esteem in which his work was held by later Greeks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ars Poetica''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Only two of the seven surviving plays&lt;ref&gt;The first printed edition of the seven plays is by Aldus Manutius in Venice 1502: Sophoclis tragaediae {{sic}} septem cum commentariis</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the addition 'cum commentariis' in the title, the Aldine edition did not include the ancient scholia to Sophocles</span>
				<span class='text'>These had to wait until 1518 when Janus Lascaris brought out the relevant edition in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; can be dated securely: ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]'' (409 BC) and ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' (401 BC, staged after Sophocles' death by his grandson)</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the others, ''[[Electra]]'' shows stylistic similarities to these two plays, which suggests that it was probably written in the latter part of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' and ''[[The Trachiniae]]'' are generally thought to be among his early works, again based on stylistic elements, with ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' coming in Sophocles' middle period</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of Sophocles' plays show an undercurrent of early [[fatalism]] and the beginnings of [[Socrates|Socratic]] logic as a mainstay for the long tradition of Greek tragedy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullion, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>85–86, rejects attempts to date ''Antigone'' to shortly before 441/0 based on an anecdote that the play led to Sophocles' election as general</span>
				<span class='text'>On other grounds, he cautiously suggests ''c</span>
				<span class='text'>' 450 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Theban plays===The Theban plays consist of three plays: ''[[Oedipus the King]]'' (also called ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' or by its Latin title ''Oedipus Rex''), ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' and ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>All three plays concern the fate of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] during and after the reign of King [[Oedipus]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Subjects====Each of the plays relates to the tale of the mythological [[Oedipus]], who killed his father and married his mother without knowledge that they were his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>His family is fated to be doomed for three generations</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''[[Oedipus the King]]'', Oedipus is the [[protagonist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Oedipus' infanticide is planned by his parents, Laius and Jocasta, to avert him from fulfilling a prophecy; in truth, the servant entrusted with the infanticide passes the infant on through a series of intermediaries to a childless couple, who adopt him not knowing his history</span>
				<span class='text'>Oedipus eventually learns of the [[Delphic Oracle]]'s prophecy of him, that he would kill his father and marry his mother; Oedipus attempts to flee his fate without harming his parents (at this point, he does not know that he is adopted)</span>
				<span class='text'>Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants; Oedipus and the man fought, and Oedipus killed the man</span>
				<span class='text'>(This man was his father, Laius, not that anyone apart from the gods knew this at the time)</span>
				<span class='text'>He becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the [[riddle of the sphinx]] and in the process,  marries the widowed queen, his mother Jocasta</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus the stage is set for horror</span>
				<span class='text'>When the truth comes out, following from another true but confusing prophecy from Delphi, Jocasta commits suicide, Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of the play, order is restored</span>
				<span class='text'>This restoration is seen when Creon, brother of Jocasta, becomes king, and also when Oedipus, before going off to exile, asks Creon to take care of his children</span>
				<span class='text'> Oedipus's children will always bear the weight of shame and humiliation because of their father's actions</span>

				<span class='text'>Print</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-393-92572-2 &lt;/ref&gt;In ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', the banished Oedipus and his daughter Antigone arrive at the town of [[Hippeios Colonus|Colonus]] where they encounter [[Theseus]], King of [[Athens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Oedipus dies and strife begins between his sons [[Polyneices]] and [[Eteocles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', the protagonist is Oedipus' daughter, Antigone</span>
				<span class='text'>She is faced with the choice of allowing her brother Polyneices' body to remain unburied, outside the city walls, exposed to the ravages of wild animals, or to bury him and face death</span>
				<span class='text'>The king of the land, Creon, has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions</span>
				<span class='text'>Creon sentences her to death</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment, but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon: his son, Haemon, who was to wed Antigone, and his wife, Eurydice, who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son</span>
				<span class='text'>===Composition and inconsistencies====The plays were written across thirty-six years of Sophocles' career and were not composed in chronological order, but instead were written in the order ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', ''[[Oedipus the King]]'', and ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor were they composed as a ''trilogy'' – a group of plays to be performed together, but are the remaining parts of three different groups of plays</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, there are some inconsistencies: notably, [[Creon]] is the undisputed king at the end of ''Oedipus the King'' and, in consultation with Apollo, single-handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes</span>
				<span class='text'>Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus' daughters [[Antigone]] and [[Ismene]] at the end of ''Oedipus the King''</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast, in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus' sons [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]] in regard to the succession</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Oedipus at Colonus'', Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole: [[Ismene]] explains that, in light of their tainted family lineage, her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy, with each brother disputing the other's right to succeed</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to being in a clearly more powerful position in ''Oedipus at Colonus'', Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable: they consent (l</span>
				<span class='text'>429, Theodoridis, tr</span>
				<span class='text'> to their father's going to exile, which is one of his bitterest charges against them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Grene pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1-2&quot;/&gt;===Other plays===In addition to the three Theban plays, there are four surviving plays by Sophocles: ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', ''[[The Women of Trachis]]'', ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]'', the last of which won first prize in 409&amp;nbsp;BC in which it competed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=F247248&gt;Freeman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>247–248</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''Ajax'' focuses on the proud hero of the Trojan War, [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]], who is driven to treachery and eventually suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>Ajax becomes gravely upset when [[Achilles]]’ armor is presented to [[Odysseus]] instead of himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite their enmity toward him, Odysseus persuades the kings [[Menelaus]] and [[Agamemnon]] to grant Ajax a proper burial</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[Women of Trachis|The Women of Trachis]]'' (named for the Trachinian women who make up the chorus) dramatizes [[Deianeira]]'s accidentally killing [[Heracles]] after he had completed his famous twelve labors</span>
				<span class='text'>Tricked into thinking it is a love charm, Deianeira applies poison to an article of Heracles' clothing; this poisoned robe causes Heracles to die an excruciating death</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon learning the truth, Deianeira commits suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>'Electra'' corresponds roughly to the plot of Aeschylus' ''[[Libation Bearers]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>It details how [[Electra]] and [[Orestes]]' avenge their father [[Agamemnon]]'s murder by [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Aegisthus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'Philoctetes'' retells the story of [[Philoctetes]], an archer who had been abandoned on [[Lemnos]] by the rest of the Greek fleet while on the way to [[Troy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After learning that they cannot win the [[Trojan War]] without Philoctetes' bow, the Greeks send [[Odysseus]] and [[Neoptolemus]] to retrieve him; due to the Greeks' earlier treachery, however, Philoctetes refuses to rejoin the army</span>
				<span class='text'>It is only Heracles' [[deus ex machina]] appearance that persuades Philoctetes to go to Troy</span>

				<span class='text'>Edited by Hugh Lloyd-Jones, Harvard University Press, 1996</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; little is known of the precise dating of most of them</span>
				<span class='text'>''Philoctetes'' is known to have been written in 409 BC, and ''Oedipus at Colonus'' is known to have only been performed in 401 BC, posthumously, at the initiation of Sophocles' grandson</span>
				<span class='text'>The convention on writing plays for the Greek festivals was to submit them in tetralogies of three tragedies along with one [[satyr]] play</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with the unknown dating of the vast majority of over 120 play titles, it is also largely unknown how the plays were grouped</span>
				<span class='text'>It is, however, known that the three plays referred to in the modern era as the &quot;Theban plays&quot; were never performed together in Sophocles' own lifetime, and are therefore not a trilogy (which they are sometimes erroneously seen as)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumbnail|Naples Museum, Naples, Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Statue of Sophocles]]There is a passage of [[Plutarch]]'s tract ''De Profectibus in Virtute 7 '' in which Sophocles discusses his own growth as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>A likely source of this material for Plutarch was the ''Epidemiae'' of Ion of Chios, a book that recorded many conversations of Sophocles</span>
				<span class='text'>This book is a likely candidate to have contained Sophocles' discourse on his own development because Ion was a friend of Sophocles, and the book is known to have been used by Plutarch</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bowra, p</span>
				<span class='text'>386</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Though some interpretations of Plutarch's words suggest that Sophocles says that he imitated Aeschylus, the translation does not fit grammatically, nor does the interpretation that Sophocles said that he was making fun of Aeschylus' works</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Maurice Bowra|C</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowra]] argues for the following translation of the line:&quot;After practising to the full the bigness of Aeschylus, then the painful ingenuity of my own invention, now in the third stage I am changing to the kind of diction which is most expressive of character and best</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bowra, p</span>
				<span class='text'>401</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Here Sophocles says that he has completed a stage of Aeschylus' work, meaning that he went through a phase of imitating Aeschylus' style but is finished with that</span>
				<span class='text'>Sophocles' opinion of Aeschylus was mixed</span>
				<span class='text'>He certainly respected him enough to imitate his work early on in his career, but he had reservations about Aeschylus' style,&lt;ref&gt;Bowra, p</span>
				<span class='text'>389</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and thus did not keep his imitation up</span>
				<span class='text'>Sophocles' first stage, in which he imitated Aeschylus, is marked by &quot;Aeschylean pomp in the language&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bowra, p</span>
				<span class='text'>392</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Sophocles' second stage was entirely his own</span>
				<span class='text'>He introduced new ways of evoking feeling out of an audience, as in his ''Ajax'', when Ajax is mocked by Athene, then the stage is emptied so that he may commit suicide alone</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bowra, p</span>
				<span class='text'>396</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Sophocles mentions a third stage, distinct from the other two, in his discussion of his development</span>
				<span class='text'>The third stage pays more heed to diction</span>
				<span class='text'>His characters spoke in a way that was more natural to them and more expressive of their individual character feelings</span>
