				<span class='text'>==Brussels===From 1845 to 1848, Engels and Marx lived in [[Brussels]], spending much of their time organising the city's German workers</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after their arrival, they contacted and joined the underground [[Communist League|German Communist League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communist League was the successor organisation to the old League of the Just which had been founded in 1837, but had recently disbanded</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The Communist League also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of Marx's and Engels' current friends became members of the Communist League</span>
				<span class='text'>Old friends like [[Georg Herwegh|Georg Friedrich Herwegh]], who had worked with Marx on the ''Rheinsche Zeitung'', [[Heinrich Heine]], the famous poet, a young doctor by the name of Roland Daniels, [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]] and [[August Herman Ewerbeck]] all maintained their contacts with Marx and Engels in Brussels</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Karl Wallau]] and [[Stephen Born]] (real name [[Simon Buttermilch]]) were both German immigrant typesetters who settled in Brussels to help Marx and Engels with their Communist League work</span>
				<span class='text'>Marx and Engels made many new important contacts through the Communist League</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the first was [[Wilhelm Wolff]], who was soon to become one of Marx's and Engels' closest collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>Others were [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] and [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]], a famous revolutionary poet</span>
				<span class='text'>While most of the associates of Marx and Engels were German immigrants living in Brussels, some of their new associates were Belgians</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Phillipe Gigot]], a Belgian philosopher and [[Victor Tedesco]], a lawyer from Liège, both joined the Communist League</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See note 517 located at page 635 in the &quot;Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of Louis Bonaparte's coup into his book about the coup</span>
				<span class='text'> Indeed, Marx even called the book ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' again using Engels' suggested characterisation</span>

				<span class='text'> However, Friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in 1864</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Five years later, Engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;en-1893&quot; /&gt; At this time, Marx was living in London but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the ideas that Engels and Marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the Russias</span>
				<span class='text'> As early as April 1853, Engels and Marx anticipated an &quot;aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia&lt;ref&gt;See the letter from Friedrich Engels to Joseph Weydemeyer dated April 12, 1853 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 39'' (New York: International Publishers, 1983) pp</span>

				<span class='text'>306</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The model for this type of aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the [[Decembrist Revolt]] of 1825</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs: Autocrats of All the Russias'' (New York: Dial Press, 1981) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>408–413</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government, both Engels and Marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in Russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in Russian development to precede a communist stage</span>
				<span class='text'> By 1881, both Marx and Engels began to contemplate a course of development in Russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage</span>
				<span class='text'>This analysis was based on what Marx and Engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the Russian village commune or [[obshchina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See the letter from Karl Marx to Vera Zasulich contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 46, (New York: International Press, 1992) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>71–72 and Engels' &quot;Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882&quot; in ''The Communist Manifesto''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Although doubt was cast on this theory by [[Georgi Plekhanov]], Plekhanov's reasoning was based on the first edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867), which predated Marx's interest in Russian peasant communes by two years</span>
				<span class='text'>Later editions of the text demonstrate Marx's sympathy for the argument of [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], that it should be possible to establish socialism in Russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition</span>

				<span class='text'>What Engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism (or, rather, pandeism, a merging of divinity with progressing humanity, a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Engels is left holding the bag of 20th century ideological extremism,&quot; Hunt writes, &quot;while Marx is rebranded as the acceptable, postpolitical seer of [[global capitalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; Hunt largely exonerates Engels stating that &quot;in no intelligible sense can Engels or Marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later, even if the policies were offered up in their honor</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;It is a fallacy that Marxism's flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [Marx and Engels] were centralisers</span>

				<span class='text'>Engels attempted to fill gaps in Marx's system and extend it to other fields</span>
				<span class='text'>He stressed [[Historical Materialism]] in particular, assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine, indeed forming [[Marxism]] as such</span>
				<span class='text'>A case in point is ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'', which supporters of socialism, like its detractors, treated as an encompassing presentation of Marx's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>And while in his extensive correspondence with German socialists Engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couple's intellectual relationship and always emphasised Marx' outstanding role, Russian communists like Lenin raised Engels up with Marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous</span>
				<span class='text'>Soviet Marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of [[Dialectical Materialism]]</span>
