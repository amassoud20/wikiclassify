				<span class='text'>He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [[Christian theology]] later called [[Calvinism]], aspects of which include the doctrine of [[predestination]] and the [[monergism|absolute sovereignty]] of God in [[salvation]] of the human soul from death and [[damnation|eternal damnation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In these areas Calvin was influenced by the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>Various [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world</span>
				<span class='text'>alvin was a tireless [[polemic]] and [[Christian apologetics|apologetic]] writer who generated much controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and [[Heinrich Bullinger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to his seminal work ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', he wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, as well as theological treatises and [[confession of faith|confessional documents]]</span>
				<span class='text'>riginally trained as a [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] lawyer, he broke from the Roman Catholic Church around 1530</span>
				<span class='text'>After religious tensions provoked a violent uprising against [[Protestants|Protestantism]] in France, Calvin fled to [[Basel]], Switzerland, where he published the first edition of the ''Institutes'' in 1536</span>
				<span class='text'>In that year, Calvin was recruited by another Frenchman [[William Farel]] to help reform the church in [[Geneva]], where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week</span>
				<span class='text'>The city council resisted the implementation of Calvin's and Farel's ideas, and both men were expelled</span>
				<span class='text'>At the invitation of [[Martin Bucer]], Calvin proceeded to [[Strasbourg]], where he became the minister of a church of French refugees</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and was eventually invited back to lead its church</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, [[Michael Servetus]], a Spaniard regarded by both [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s as having [[Christian heresy|heretical]] views, arrived in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>He was denounced by Calvin and burned at the stake for heresy by the city council</span>
				<span class='text'>Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>]John Calvin was born as Jehan Cauvin on 10 July 1509, in the town of [[Noyon]] in the [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]] region of [[Kingdom of France|France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robert Dean Linder, ''The Reformation Era'', (Greenwood Press, 2008), 139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was the first of four sons who survived infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Jeanne le Franc, was the daughter of an innkeeper from [[Cambrai]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She died in Calvin's childhood, from an unknown cause, after bearing four more children</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin's father, [[Gérard Cauvin]], had a prosperous career as the cathedral [[Notary public|notary]] and registrar to the [[ecclesiastical court]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gérard Cauvin died in 1531, after suffering two years with testicular cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>Gérard intended his three sons—Charles, Jean, and Antoine—for the priesthood</span>
				<span class='text'>ean was particularly precocious; by age 12, he was employed by the bishop as a clerk and received the [[tonsure]], cutting his hair to symbolise his dedication to the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He also won the patronage of an influential family, the Montmors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=8–12}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through their assistance, Calvin was able to attend the Collège de la Marche, in Paris, where he learned [[Latin]] from one of its greatest teachers, [[Mathurin Cordier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganoczy|2004|pp=3–4}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=12–16}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|p=21}}</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=22–27}} states that Nicolas Colladon was the source that he attended Collège de la Marche which McGrath disputes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed the course, he entered the [[Collège de Montaigu]] as a philosophy student</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=17–18}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1525 or 1526, Gérard withdrew his son from the Collège de Montaigu and enrolled him in the [[University of Orléans]] to study law</span>
				<span class='text'>According to contemporary biographers [[Theodore Beza]] and [[Nicolas Colladon]], Gérard believed his son would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1975|p=15}}</span>
				<span class='text'>According to {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|p=20}}, there may have been a family conflict with the clergy in Noyon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After a few years of quiet study, Calvin entered the [[University of Bourges]] in 1529</span>
				<span class='text'>He was intrigued by [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciati]], a humanist lawyer</span>
				<span class='text'>Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies</span>
				<span class='text'>During his 18-month stay in [[Bourges]], Calvin learned [[Koine Greek]], a necessity for studying the [[New Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=20–24}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1975|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the autumn of 1533 Calvin experienced a [[religious conversion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In later life, John Calvin wrote two accounts of his conversion that differ in significant ways</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first account he portrays his conversion as a sudden change of mind, brought about by God</span>
				<span class='text'>This account can be found in his ''Commentary on the Book of Psalms'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;God by a sudden conversion subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than might have been expected from one at my early period of life</span>
				<span class='text'>Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness, I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress therein, that although I did not altogether leave off other studies, yet I pursued them with less ardour</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his second account he speaks of a long process of inner turmoil, followed by spiritual and psychological anguish</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Being exceedingly alarmed at the misery into which I had fallen, and much more at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears</span>
				<span class='text'>And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;from: Bruce Gordon, ''Calvin'', New Haven; London 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Scholars have argued about the precise interpretation of these accounts, but it is agreed that his conversion corresponded with his break from the Roman Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganoczy|2004|pp=9–10}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=65–70}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=199–203}}; {{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=68–70}}, Ganoczy in his book ''Le Jeune Calvin</span>
				<span class='text'>Genèse et evolution de sa vocation réformatrice'', Wiesbaden: F</span>
				<span class='text'>Steiner, 1966 p</span>
				<span class='text'>302, argues that Calvin conversion took place over several years and that it was not a biographical or chronological event</span>
				<span class='text'>Cottret quotes Olivier Millet, ''Calvin et la dynamique de la Parole</span>
				<span class='text'>Essai de rhétorique réformée'', Paris: H</span>
				<span class='text'>Champion 1992 p</span>
				<span class='text'>522, noting a typological rather than a biographical perspective of the account of his conversion</span>
				<span class='text'>The biographical argument is promoted by D</span>
				<span class='text'>Fischer, &quot;Conversion de Calvin&quot;, ''Etudes Theéologiques et Religieuses'' 58 (1983) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>203–220</span>
				<span class='text'>According to {{Harvnb|Parker|1975|pp=192–196}} Parker is in sympathy with Ganoczy's view, but in his investigations, he concluded that a certain period for his conversion could be determined</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Calvin biographer Bruce Gordon has stressed that &quot;the two accounts are not antithetical, revealing some inconsistency in Calvin's memory, but rather [are] two different ways of expressing the same reality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gordon, ''Calvin'', New Haven; London 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his conversion (scholars have argued), Calvin also believed himself to have experienced a prophetic calling to reform the church, which is briefly reflected in the Psalms commentary account of his conversion and in many of his sermons and a number of his polemical tracts &quot;&lt;ref&gt;See most recently: Jon Balserak, ''John Calvin as Sixteenth-Century Prophet'', Oxford 2014</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By 1532, Calvin received his [[licentiate]] in law and published his first book, a commentary on [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[De Clementia]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>After uneventful trips to Orléans and his hometown of Noyon, Calvin returned to Paris in October 1533</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, tensions rose at the [[Collège de France|Collège Royal]] (later to become the Collège de France) between the humanists/reformers and the conservative senior faculty members</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the reformers, [[Nicolas Cop]], was rector of the university</span>
				<span class='text'>On 1 November 1533 he devoted his inaugural address to the need for reform and renewal in the Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>he address provoked a strong reaction from the faculty, who denounced it as heretical, forcing Cop to flee to [[Basel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin, a close friend of Cop, was implicated in the offence, and for the next year he was forced into hiding</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained on the move, sheltering with his friend Louis du Tillet in [[Angoulême]] and taking refuge in Noyon and Orléans</span>
				<span class='text'>He was finally forced to flee France during the [[Affair of the Placards]] in mid-October 1534</span>
				<span class='text'>In that incident, unknown reformers had posted placards in various cities attacking the Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]], which provoked a violent backlash against Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1535, Calvin joined Cop in Basel, a city under the influence of the reformer [[Johannes Oecolampadius]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[William Farel]] was the reformer who convinced Calvin to stay in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>16th Century painting</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire (Geneva)|Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire, Geneva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]In March 1536, Calvin published the first edition of his ''Institutio Christianae Religionis'' or ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was an ''[[apologia]]'' or defense of his faith and a statement of the doctrinal position of the reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>He also intended it to serve as an elementary instruction book for anyone interested in the Christian religion</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was the first expression of [[Calvinism|his theology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin updated the work and published new editions throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganoczy|2004|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=110–114}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=52, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its publication, he left Basel for [[Ferrara]], Italy, where he briefly served as secretary to [[Renée of France|Princess Renée of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By June he was back in Paris with his brother Antoine, who was resolving their father's affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the [[Edict of Coucy]], which gave a limited six-month period for heretics to reconcile with the Catholic faith, Calvin decided that there was no future for him in France</span>
				<span class='text'>In August he set off for [[Strasbourg]], a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and a refuge for reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to [[Italian War of 1536–1538|military manoeuvres of imperial and French forces]], he was forced to make a detour to the south, bringing him to [[Geneva]]</span>
				<span class='text'>alvin had only intended to stay a single night, but [[William Farel]], a fellow French reformer residing in the city, implored a most reluctant Calvin to stay and assist him in his work of reforming the church there&amp;nbsp;– it was his duty before God, Farel insisted</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Calvin, for his part, desired only peace and privacy</span>
				<span class='text'>But it was not to be; Farel's entreaties prevailed, but not before his having had recourse to the sternest imprecations</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin recalls the rather intense encounter:&lt;blockquote&gt;Then Farel, who was working with incredible zeal to promote the gospel, bent all his efforts to keep me in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>And when he realized that I was determined to study in privacy in some obscure place, and saw that he gained nothing by entreaty, he descended to cursing, and said that God would surely curse my peace if I held back from giving help at a time of such great need</span>

				<span class='text'>He was eventually given the title of &quot;reader&quot;, which most likely meant that he could give expository lectures on the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometime in 1537 he was selected to be a &quot;pastor&quot; although he never received any [[Ordination|pastoral consecration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the lawyer-theologian took up pastoral duties such as [[baptism]]s, weddings, and church services</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the fall of 1536, Farel drafted a [[confession of faith]] while Calvin wrote separate articles on reorganizing the church in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their ''Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève'' (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Greef|2004|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations of the [[Eucharist]], the reason for, and the method of, [[excommunication]], the requirement to subscribe to the confession of faith, the use of congregational singing in the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], and the revision of marriage laws</span>
				<span class='text'>The council accepted the document on the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=128–129}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1975|pp=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;As the year progressed, however, Calvin and Farel's reputation with the council began to suffer</span>
				<span class='text'>The council was reluctant to enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>On 26 November, the two ministers heatedly debated the council over the issue</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors began to question their loyalty</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when [[Bern]], Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies</span>
				<span class='text'>One proposal required the use of [[unleavened]] bread for the [[Eucharist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed the use of such bread until a [[synod]] in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision</span>
				<span class='text'>The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for the Easter Eucharist; in protest, the ministers did not administer communion during the Easter service</span>
				<span class='text'>This caused a riot during the service and the next day, the council told the ministers to leave Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=98–100}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=129–131}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=85–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;Farel and Calvin went to Bern and Zurich to plead their case</span>
				<span class='text'>The synod in Zurich placed most of the blame on Calvin for not being sympathetic enough toward the people of Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it asked Bern to mediate with the aim of restoring the ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>The Geneva council refused to readmit the two men, who took refuge in Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, Farel received an invitation to lead the church in [[Neuchâtel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin was invited to lead a church of French refugees in Strasbourg by that city's leading reformers, [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, Calvin refused because Farel was not included in the invitation, but relented when Bucer appealed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>By September 1538 Calvin had taken up his new position in [[Strasbourg]], fully expecting that this time it would be permanent; a few months later, he applied for and was granted citizenship of the city</span>

				<span class='text'> Calvin ministered to 400–500 members in his church</span>
				<span class='text'>He preached or lectured every day, with two sermons on Sunday</span>
				<span class='text'>Communion was celebrated monthly and congregational singing of the psalms was encouraged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on the second edition of the ''Institutes''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the first edition sold out within a year, Calvin was dissatisfied with its structure as a catechism, a primer for young Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>or the second edition, published in 1539, Calvin dropped this format in favour of systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concurrently worked on another book, the ''Commentary on Romans'', which was published in March 1540</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin [[Vulgate]], an [[exegesis]], and an [[Expository preaching|exposition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=97–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], and [[Martin Bucer]], but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=143–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;Calvin's friends urged him to marry</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and do not know whether I will ever be</span>
				<span class='text'>If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from numerous worries, I can devote myself to the Lord</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family</span>
				<span class='text'>Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place</span>
				<span class='text'>He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, &quot;unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1975|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in August of that year, he married [[Idelette de Bure]], a widow who had two children from her first marriage</span>

				<span class='text'>Church attendance had dwindled and the political climate had changed; as Bern and Geneva quarrelled over land, their alliance frayed</span>
				<span class='text'>When Cardinal [[Jacopo Sadoleto]] wrote a letter to the city council inviting Geneva to return to the Catholic faith, the council searched for an ecclesiastical authority to respond to him</span>
				<span class='text'>At first [[Pierre Viret]] was consulted, but when he refused, the council asked Calvin</span>
				<span class='text'>He agreed and his ''Responsio ad Sadoletum'' (Letter to Sadoleto) strongly defended Geneva's position concerning reforms in the church</span>

				<span class='text'>An embassy reached Calvin while he was at a [[Colloquy (religious)|colloquy]], a conference to settle religious disputes, in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His reaction to the suggestion was one of horror in which he wrote, &quot;Rather would I submit to death a hundred times than to that cross on which I had to perish daily a thousand times over</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;Calvin also wrote that he was prepared to follow the Lord's calling</span>
				<span class='text'>A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in Geneva for six months while Bucer and Calvin would visit the city to determine the next steps</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>By summer 1541, Strasbourg decided to loan Calvin to Geneva for six months</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=103–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Reform in Geneva (1541–1549)==In supporting Calvin's proposals for reforms, the council of Geneva passed the ''Ordonnances ecclésiastiques'' (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541</span>
				<span class='text'>The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the [[sacraments]]; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] to provide discipline; and [[deacons]] to care for the poor and needy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganoczy|2004|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also called for the creation of the ''[[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|Consistoire]]'' ([[Genevan Consistory|Consistory]]), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government</span>

				<span class='text'>Calvin recognised the power of music and he intended that it be used to support scripture readings</span>
				<span class='text'>The original Strasbourg [[psalter]] contained twelve psalms by [[Clément Marot]] and Calvin added several more hymns of his own composition in the Geneva version</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Louis Bourgeois (composer)|Louis Bourgeois]], also a refugee, lived and taught music in Geneva for sixteen years and Calvin took the opportunity to add his hymns, the most famous being the [[Old Hundredth]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Calvin had written an earlier [[catechism]] during his first stay in Geneva which was largely based on [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Large Catechism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first version was arranged pedagogically, describing Law, Faith, and Prayer</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1542 version was rearranged for theological reasons, covering Faith first, then Law and Prayer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;Historians debate the extent to which Geneva was a [[theocracy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On the one hand, Calvin's theology clearly called for separation between church and state</span>

				<span class='text'>Idelette fell ill in 1545 and died on 29 March 1549</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Michael Servetus]] exchanged many letters with Calvin until he was denounced by Calvin and executed</span>
				<span class='text'>]The turning point in Calvin's fortunes occurred when [[Michael Servetus]], a fugitive from ecclesiastical authorities, appeared in Geneva on 13 August 1553</span>
				<span class='text'>Servetus was a Spanish physician and Protestant theologian who boldly criticised the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and [[paedobaptism]] (infant baptism)</span>

				<span class='text'>He went to Strasbourg where he published a pamphlet against the Trinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Bucer publicly refuted it and asked Servetus to leave</span>
				<span class='text'>After returning to Basel, Servetus published ''[[Dialogorum de Trinitate libri duo|Two Books of Dialogues on the Trinity]]'' ({{lang-la|Dialogorum de Trinitate libri duo}}) which caused a sensation among Reformers and Catholics alike</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition in Spain]] ordered his arrest</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thirty letters to Calvin- Michael Servetus Christianismi Restitutio-Part 4&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Calvin lost patience and refused to respond; by this time Servetus had written around thirty letters to Calvin</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin was particularly outraged when Servetus sent him a copy of the ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' heavily annotated with arguments pointing to errors in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>When Servetus mentioned that he would come to Geneva, &quot;Espeville&quot; (Calvin) wrote a letter to Farel on 13 February 1546 noting that if Servetus were to come, he would not assure him safe conduct: &quot;for if he came, as far as my authority goes, I would not let him leave alive</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;On his way to Italy, Servetus stopped in Geneva to visit &quot;''d'Espeville''&quot;, where he was recognized and arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin's secretary Nicholas de la Fontaine composed a list of accusations that was submitted before the court</span>
				<span class='text'>The prosecutor was [[Philibert Berthelier (Son of Geneva patriot)|Philibert Berthelier]], a member of a libertine family and son of a famous [[Philibert Berthelier (Geneva patriot)|Geneva patriot]], and the sessions were led by Pierre Tissot, Perrin's brother-in-law</span>
				<span class='text'>The libertines allowed the trial to drag on in an attempt to harass Calvin</span>
				<span class='text'>The difficulty in using Servetus as a weapon against Calvin was that the heretical reputation of Servetus was widespread and most of the cities in Europe were observing and awaiting the outcome of the trial</span>
				<span class='text'>This posed a dilemma for the libertines, so on 21 August the council decided to write to other Swiss cities for their opinions, thus mitigating their own responsibility for the final decision</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1975|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting for the responses, the council also asked Servetus if he preferred to be judged in Vienne or in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>He begged to stay in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 October the replies from Zurich, Basel, Bern, and [[Schaffhausen]] were read and the council condemned Servetus as a heretic</span>

				<span class='text'>He had always insisted that the Consistory retain the power of excommunication, despite the council's past decision to take it away</span>
				<span class='text'>During Servetus's trial, Philibert Berthelier asked the council for permission to take communion, as he had been excommunicated the previous year for insulting a minister</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin protested that the council did not have the legal authority to overturn Berthelier's excommunication</span>
				<span class='text'>Unsure of how the council would rule, he hinted in a sermon on 3 September 1553 that he might be dismissed by the authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>The council decided to re-examine the ''Ordonnances'' and on 18 September it voted in support of Calvin—excommunication was within the jurisdiction of the Consistory</span>
				<span class='text'>Berthelier applied for reinstatement to another Genevan administrative assembly, the ''Deux Cents'' (Two Hundred), in November</span>
				<span class='text'>This body reversed the council's decision and stated that the final arbiter concerning excommunication should be the council</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the ministers continued to protest, and as in the case of Servetus, the opinions of the Swiss churches were sought</span>
				<span class='text'>The affair dragged on through 1554</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, on 22 January 1555, the council announced the decision of the Swiss churches: the original ''Ordonnances'' were to be kept and the Consistory was to regain its official powers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=195–198}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;The libertines' downfall began with the February 1555 elections</span>
				<span class='text'>By then, many of the French refugees had been granted citizenship and with their support, Calvin's partisans elected the majority of the syndics and the councillors</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 May the libertines took to the streets in a drunken protest and attempted to burn down a house that was supposedly full of Frenchmen</span>
				<span class='text'>The syndic Henri Aulbert tried to intervene, carrying with him the [[Sceptre|baton of office]] that symbolised his power</span>
				<span class='text'>Perrin seized the baton and waved it over the crowd, which gave the appearance that he was taking power and initiating a ''coup d'état''</span>
				<span class='text'>The insurrection was soon over when another syndic appeared and ordered Perrin to go with him to the town hall</span>
				<span class='text'>Perrin and other leaders were forced to flee the city</span>
				<span class='text'>With the approval of Calvin, the other plotters who remained in the city were found and executed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] branches of the Reformation movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1975|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'', a [[concordat]] between the Zurich and Geneva churches</span>
				<span class='text'>He reached out to England when [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] called for an [[ecumenical]] synod of all the evangelical churches</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1975|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;Calvin sheltered [[Marian exiles]] (those who fled the reign of Catholic Mary Tudor in England) in Geneva starting in 1555</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the city's protection, they were able to form their own reformed church under [[John Knox]] and [[William Whittingham]] and eventually carried Calvin's ideas on doctrine and polity back to England and Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=170–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Calvin was most interested in reforming his homeland, France</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported the building of churches by distributing literature and sending ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1555 and 1562, more than 100 ministers were sent to France</span>
				<span class='text'>These efforts were funded by the church in Geneva, as the city council had refused to become involved in missionary activities at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Henry II of France|Henry II]] severely persecuted Protestants under the [[Edict of Chateaubriand]] and when the French authorities complained about the missionary activities, Geneva was able to disclaim responsibility</span>

				<span class='text'>The only way to obtain it is to study scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin writes, &quot;For anyone to arrive at God the Creator he needs Scripture as his Guide and Teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not try to prove the authority of scripture but rather describes it as ''autopiston'' or self-authenticating</span>

				<span class='text'>He often cited the [[Church Fathers]] in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerrish|2004|pp=290–291, 302}}</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Gerrish, Calvin put his defence against the charge of novelty in the preface of every edition of the ''Institutes''</span>
				<span class='text'>The original preface of the first edition was addressed to the King of France, Francis I</span>
				<span class='text'>The defence expressed his opinion that patristic authority favoured the reformers and that allegation of the reformers deviating from the patristic consensus was a fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>See also {{Harvnb|Steinmetz|1995|pp=122–137}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Calvin's view, sin began with the fall of [[Adam]] and propagated to all of humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=80–88}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived during the time of the [[Old Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>God made a covenant with [[Abraham]], promising the coming of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, the [[Old Covenant]] was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin then describes the [[New Covenant]] using the passage from the [[Apostles' Creed]] that describes Christ's suffering under [[Pontius Pilate]] and his return to judge the living and the dead</span>
				<span class='text'>For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=57–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the third book, Calvin describes how the spiritual union of Christ and humanity is achieved</span>
				<span class='text'>He first defines faith as the firm and certain knowledge of God in Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>The immediate effects of faith are [[repentance]] and the remission of sin</span>
				<span class='text'>This is followed by spiritual [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]], which returns the believer to the state of holiness before Adam's transgression</span>
				<span class='text'>However, complete perfection is unattainable in this life, and the believer should expect a continual struggle against sin</span>

				<span class='text'>He defined justification as &quot;the acceptance by which God regards us as righteous whom he has received into grace</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, it is clear that it is God who initiates and carries through the action and that people play no role; God is completely sovereign in salvation</span>

				<span class='text'>Fellow theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included [[Thomas Aquinas]] and Martin Luther,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Calvin's formulation of the doctrine went further than the tradition that went before him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heron|2005|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle, in Calvin's words, is that &quot;All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=135–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;Calvin defined a sacrament as an earthly sign associated with a promise from God</span>

				<span class='text'>210&lt;/ref&gt; To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be put down</span>

				<span class='text'>1598&lt;/ref&gt;Calvin thought that agriculture and the traditional crafts were normal human activities</span>
				<span class='text'>With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Calvin wrote many letters to religious and political leaders throughout Europe, including this one sent to [[Edward VI of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Calvin produced commentaries on most of the books of the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>His first commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on [[I Corinthians]], but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal</span>
				<span class='text'>Within four years he had published commentaries on all the [[Pauline epistles]], and he also revised the commentary on Romans</span>
				<span class='text'>He then turned his attention to the [[general epistles]], dedicating them to [[Edward VI of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and the [[Gospels]] (he omitted only the brief second and third [[Epistles of John]] and the [[Book of Revelation]])</span>
				<span class='text'>For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], the books of the [[Pentateuch]], the [[Psalms]], and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>However, from 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes</span>
				<span class='text'>These ''Praelectiones'' covered the [[minor prophets]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and part of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Following the ''Responsio ad Sadoletum'', Calvin wrote an open letter at the request of Bucer to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1543, ''Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem'', defending the reformed faith</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed by an open letter to the pope (''Admonitio paterna Pauli III'') in 1544, in which Calvin admonished [[Paul III]] for depriving the reformers of any prospect of rapprochement</span>
				<span class='text'>The pope proceeded to open the [[Council of Trent]], which resulted in decrees against the reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the ''Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto'' in 1547</span>
				<span class='text'>When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the [[Augsburg Interim]], Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote the treatise, ''Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae ratio'' in 1549, in which he described the doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Greef|2004|pp=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;Calvin provided many of the foundational documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance</span>
				<span class='text'>He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the [[Gallic Confession]], and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Belgic Confession]] of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession</span>

				<span class='text'>Increasing secularisation was accompanied by the decline of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the Geneva ''académie'' was eclipsed by universities in [[Leiden University|Leiden]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], which became the new strongholds of Calvin's ideas, first identified as &quot;[[Calvinism]]&quot; by Joachim Westphal in 1552</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1585, Geneva, once the wellspring of the reform movement, had become merely its symbol</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=200–201}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Calvin had always warned against describing him as an &quot;idol&quot; and Geneva as a new &quot;Jerusalem&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged people to adapt to the environments in which they found themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Even during his polemical exchange with Westphal, he advised a group of French-speaking refugees, who had settled in [[Wesel]], Germany, to integrate with the local Lutheran churches</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his differences with the Lutherans, he did not deny that they were members of the true Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Calvin's recognition of the need to adapt to local conditions became an important characteristic of the reformation movement as it spread across Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>Calvinism was adopted in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] under [[Frederick III, Elector Palatine|Frederick III]], which led to the formulation of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] in 1563</span>

				<span class='text'>Several leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr]], and [[Jan Laski]]) and Scotland ([[John Knox]])</span>

				<span class='text'>s the Ottoman Empire did not force Muslim conversion on its conquered western territories, reformed ideas were quickly adopted in the two-thirds of Hungary they occupied (the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]-ruled third part of Hungary remained Catholic)</span>
				<span class='text'>A Reformed Constitutional Synod was held in 1567 in Debrecen, the main hub of Hungarian Calvinism, where the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] was adopted as the official confession of [[Hungarian Reformed Church|Hungarian Calvinists]]</span>
