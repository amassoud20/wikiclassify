				<span class='text'>He earned the respect of both his own troops and his enemies</span>

				<span class='text'>In [[World War II]], he further distinguished himself as the commander of the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] during the [[Battle of France|1940 invasion of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His leadership of German and Italian forces in the [[North African campaign]] established him as one of the most able commanders of the war, and earned him the appellation of the Desert Fox</span>
				<span class='text'>He is regarded as one of the most skilled commanders of [[desert warfare]] in the conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=xiv|loc=comment from Liddell Hart}}  He later commanded the German forces opposing the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cross-channel [[invasion of Normandy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ommel is regarded as having been a humane and professional officer</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=241}} His ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' was never accused of war crimes, and Allied soldiers captured during his Africa campaign were reported to have been treated humanely</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=xv|loc=Quote from Liddel Hart in his intro: This was inspired primarily by the speed and surprise of his operations, but it was fostered by the way he maintained in African warfare the decencies of the soldierly code, and by his own chivalrous behavior toward the many prisoners of war whom he met in person}} Orders to kill [[Jewish]] soldiers, civilians and captured [[Commando Order|commandos]] were ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=242}} Later in the war, Rommel was indirectly linked to the [[20 July plot|conspiracy]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Rommel was a national hero, Hitler desired to eliminate him quietly</span>
				<span class='text'>He forced Rommel to commit suicide with a [[potassium cyanide|cyanide]] pill, in return for assurances that Rommel's family would not be persecuted following his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He was given a state funeral, and it was announced that Rommel had succumbed to his injuries from an earlier strafing of his staff car in Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>= Early life and career ==Rommel was born on 15 November 1891 in [[Southern Germany]] at [[Heidenheim an der Brenz|Heidenheim]], {{convert|45|km|mi}} from [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], then part of the [[German Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the second of four children of Erwin Rommel Senior (1860–1913), a teacher and school administrator, and his wife Helene von Lutz, who headed the local government council</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young man Rommel's father had been a lieutenant in the artillery</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel had one older sister and three younger brothers, one of whom died in infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=8}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=26–27}}At the age of 14, Rommel and a friend built a full-scale glider and were able to fly it short distances</span>
				<span class='text'>He later purchased a motorcycle, and upon getting home immediately set about taking it apart and putting it back together</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=219}} Rommel considered becoming an [[aeronautical engineer]], but at age 18 he acceded to his father's wishes and joined the local 124th Württemberg Infantry Regiment as a ''[[Fähnrich]]'' ([[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]), in 1910, studying at the Officer Cadet School in [[Danzig]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=10}} He graduated in November 1911 and was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] in January 1912 and was assigned to the 124th Infantry in [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=30–31}} He was posted to Ulm in March 1914 to command the No</span>
				<span class='text'> Battery, 46th Field Artillery Regiment, [[XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Until the start of the [[First World War]] he trained new recruits and gave refresher courses to reserve officers, and then returned to the 124th when war was declared</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=43}} While at Cadet School, Rommel met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894–1971)</span>
				<span class='text'>They married in November 1916 in Danzig</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|German infantry advance up a slope in the Argonne forest, 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>]During World War I, Rommel fought in [[France]] as well as in the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaigns]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He gained success leading small groups of men, using tactics such as infiltrating through enemy lines under cover of darkness, moving forward rapidly to a flanking position to arrive at their rear, and attacking defenders using the element of surprise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=4}} Arriving at the front near [[Verdun]] on 22 August 1914, Rommel initially commanded a platoon in 2nd Battalion, 124th Regiment</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=25}} They were assigned to reconnaissance and courier tasks</span>
				<span class='text'>His first combat experience was on 22 August 1914, when – catching the French garrison unprepared at the village of Bleid – he and three men engaged the enemy without waiting for the rest of their platoon to arrive</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=27–29}} Rommel was often ill while on active duty, particularly with stomach troubles and exhaustion, a problem that manifested itself from the beginning of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=25}} He was appointed Battalion Adjutant in September</span>
				<span class='text'>The armies continued to skirmish in open engagements throughout September, as the static [[trench warfare]] typical of the First World War was still in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=31}} On 24 September Rommel was shot in the leg when he engaged several French soldiers armed only with his bayonet (he had run out of ammunition)</span>
				<span class='text'>For this action, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=36}}On his return in January 1915, Rommel was assigned to command 9th Company, 124th Regiment, stationed in the trenches near [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=25}}{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=39}} On 29 January, he and his platoon crawled through {{convert|100|yd}} of barbed wire to engage the French, who were positioned in blockhouses and earthworks</span>
				<span class='text'>His company was running low on ammunition and were ordered to retreat</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel ordered an attack on one of the blockhouses to keep the enemy from opening fire on the withdrawing men</span>
				<span class='text'>For his work that day, he was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=43}}He continued to soldier in the trenches of France for another nine months, and received a minor shrapnel wound to the leg on 29 June 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=43}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=50}}  He was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) and transferred to the newly created ''Königliche Wurttemberg Gebirgsbataillon'' (Royal Wurttemberg Mountain Battalion) of the ''[[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]'' in September</span>
				<span class='text'>He was commander of 2nd Company, which trained in mountain warfare in Austria until December, when they were posted on a {{convert|6|mile|adj=on}} stretch of front in the [[Vosges]] mountains of [[Alsace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=43, 45}} They remained there, seeing action in reconnaissance work and raids on enemy positions until October 1916, when they were moved to the [[Southern Carpathians]] to fight the Romanians, who had joined the conflict in August</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=48–49}} In August 1917, his unit was involved in the battle for Mount Cosna, a heavily fortified objective on the border between Hungary and Romania</span>
				<span class='text'>They succeeded after nearly two weeks of difficult uphill fighting and were withdrawn to reserve on 25 August</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=53–60}} The unit spent six weeks recuperating in [[Carinthia]], and Rommel received leave to return to Danzig to see his wife and recover from a gunshot wound to the arm that he had received in the fight at Mount Cosna</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=65}}The Mountain Battalion was next assigned to fight on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Isonzo front]], a mountainous area which had been the scene of near-constant fighting since the entry of Italy into the war on the Allied side on 23 May 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>The offensive known as the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo, or the [[Battle of Caporetto]], began on 24 October 1917 with a four-hour artillery barrage</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=65–67}} Rommel's ''[[Abteilung]]'',  consisting of three rifle companies and a machine gun unit, was part of an attempt to take enemy positions on three mountains: [[Kolovrat (mountain ridge)|Kolovrat]], [[Matajur]], and Stol</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=14}} Beginning at dawn on 25 October, Rommel took advantage of the terrain to outflank the Italians and gain control of the ridge on Kolovrat, taking 1,500 prisoners in the first three hours</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=71}} Noticing that there was no field of fire on a supply road leading down to the village of Luico (now [[Livek]]), Rommel and 150 of his men proceeded down and captured the town, {{convert|2|miles}} behind enemy lines</span>
				<span class='text'>Believing the presence of Rommels' group to be proof that their lines had collapsed, a column of Italian light infantry, 2,000 strong, surrendered after a brief firefight</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=72–73}} Before dawn on the 26th, Rommel led his ''Abteilung'', now reinforced with two additional machine gun companies, toward Matajur</span>
				<span class='text'>They took the village of Jevszek without a fight, capturing another 1,600 men</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of orders not to attack, they assaulted Matajur from an unexpected direction from behind the Italian lines, arriving at the summit shortly before noon on 27 October</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=74–77}} In two and a half days, he and his small contingent of men had captured 81 guns and 9,000 men (including 150 officers), at the loss of six dead and 30 wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=15}} Acting as advance guard in the capture of [[Longarone]] on 9 November, he again decided to attack with a much smaller force</span>
				<span class='text'>Reinforcements continued to arrive, and fighting continued through the night</span>
				<span class='text'>Convinced that they were surrounded by an entire German division, the 1st Italian Infantry Division – 10,000 men – surrendered to Rommel at dawn</span>
				<span class='text'>For this and his work at Matajur, he (and his battalion commander, Major {{illm|Theodor Sproesser|de}}) received the order of [[Pour le Mérite]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a week on leave in January 1918, Rommel was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (captain) and assigned to a staff position with XLIV Army Corps, where he served for the remainder of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=78–81}}== Between the wars ==Rommel remained with the 124th Regiment until 1 October 1920, when he was named company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment in Stuttgart, a post he held with the rank of captain for the next nine years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=15}} His regiment was involved in quelling riots and civil disturbances that were occurring throughout Germany at this time</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=100}} Wherever possible, he avoided the use of force in these confrontations</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=86}} He was assigned as an instructor at the [[Dresden]] Infantry School from 1929 to 1933, and was promoted to major in April 1932</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=15}}{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=98}} While at Dresden, he wrote ''Gefechts-Aufgaben für Zug und Kompanie : Ein Handbuch für den Offizierunterricht'' (''Combat tasks for platoon and company: A manual for the officer instruction in infantry training'', published in 1934) and his book ''[[Infanterie Greift An]]'' (''Infantry Attacks''), a description of his wartime experiences along with his analysis, published in 1937</span>
				<span class='text'>It became a bestseller; [[Adolf Hitler]] was one of many people who owned a copy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=133–134}} During this period he indulged his interest in engineering and mechanics by learning about the inner workings and maintenance of internal combustion engines and heavy machine guns</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=100, 103}} He memorized [[logarithm tables]] in his spare time, and enjoyed skiing and other outdoor sports</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=99}}Rommel was promoted to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (lieutenant colonel) in October 1933 given his next command, the 3rd ''[[Jäger (infantry)|Jäger]]'' Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, stationed at [[Goslar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=100}} Here he first met Hitler, who inspected his troops on 30 September 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>On this occasion the [[SS]] major in charge of Hitler's bodyguard tried to place a row of his men in front of Rommel's men, ostensibly to protect the [[Führer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Insulted, Rommel refused to turn out his battalion</span>
				<span class='text'>The S</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>were ordered to stand down</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=9}}In September 1935 Rommel was moved to the War Academy at Potsdam as an instructor, a post he held for the next three years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=117}} Hearing of Rommel's reputation as an outstanding military instructor, in February 1937 Hitler assigned him as the War Ministry liaison officer to the [[Hitler Youth]], in charge of military training</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he clashed with [[Baldur von Schirach]], the Hitler Youth leader, over the amount of military training that the boys should receive</span>
				<span class='text'>Accounts differ: Rommel himself said that he wished to concentrate on basic education and minimize the military aspects, while von Schirach's version was that Rommel wished to focus on nothing else</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel left the programme in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=132}}{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=120–121}}In 1938 Rommel, who had been promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' (colonel) on 1 August 1937, was appointed commandant of the [[Theresian Military Academy]] War Academy at [[Wiener Neustadt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=137}} In October 1938 Hitler specially requested that Rommel be seconded to command the ''[[Führerbegleitbrigade]]'' (his escort battalion) for his entry into Prague during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=142}} This unit accompanied him whenever he traveled outside of Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=9}} While Rommel developed an admiration for Hitler, he never joined the [[Nazi Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=138}}{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=119}} He refused to permit his son to join the SS</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=146}} Rommel attended Hitler's daily war briefings and accompanied him everywhere, making use of the opportunity to observe first-hand the use of tanks and other motorized units</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=141}} On 26 September Rommel returned to Berlin to set up a new headquarters for his unit in the [[Reich Chancellery]], and returned briefly to Warsaw on 5 October for the German victory parade in that city</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|p=151}} Rommel's successes in World War I were based on surprise and maneuver, two elements for which the new panzer units were ideally suited</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=114}} With Hitler's support and in spite of his lack of experience commanding mechanized units, Rommel was given command of [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] on 10 February 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=151}} The unit had been recently converted to a fully armoured division consisting of 218 tanks in three battalions, with two rifle regiments, a motorcycle battalion, an engineer battalion, and an anti-tank battalion</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=156–157}} Upon taking command he quickly set his unit to practicing the maneuvers they would need in the upcoming campaign</span>

				<span class='text'>Then, in a surprise move later described as the ''Sichelschnitt'' (sickle cut), [[Army Group A]], commanded by ''Generaloberst'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], would move through the [[Ardennes]] forest and drive for the English Channel, thus cutting off the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) and a large part of the French Army, trapping them along the coast</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=154–155}} Rommel brought up tanks and flak units to provide suppressive counter-fire</span>
				<span class='text'>With no smoke units available, he improvised by having nearby houses set on fire to create smoke</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent infantry across in rubber boats, appropriated the bridging tackle of the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]], and went into the water himself, encouraging the sappers and helping lash together the pontoons</span>

				<span class='text'>He feared he had just a few months before an invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>His presence greatly invigorated the fortification effort along the [[Atlantic Wall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=220}} He had millions of mines laid and thousands of tank traps and obstacles set up on the beaches and throughout the countryside, including in fields suitable for glider aircraft landings, the so-called ''[[Rommelspargel]]'' (&quot;Rommel's asparagus&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel's arrival in Northern France instilled a great deal of purpose to the demoralized units that were simply waiting for the inevitable attack</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=220}}  His efforts to buttress the Atlantic Wall went a long way in improving their effectiveness</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Whitlock pp</span>
				<span class='text'>93–107&lt;/ref&gt; The obstructions compelled the Allies to land at low tide, which narrowed the time frames they could land and increased the length of the beach to be crossed, but uncovered and revealed the obstacles, reducing their effectiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>on Rundstedt expected the Allies to invade in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] because it was the shortest crossing point from Britain, its port facilities were essential to supplying a large invasion force, and the distance from Calais to Germany was relatively short</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=60}} Hitler and his various intelligence services largely agreed with this assessment</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel, believing that Normandy was indeed a likely landing ground, argued that it did not matter to the Allies where they landed, just that the landing was successful</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Inspecting 21st Panzer Division troops and a mule track carrier of the Nebelwerfer</span>
				<span class='text'>]Hitler vacillated between the two strategies</span>
				<span class='text'>In late April, he ordered the 1st SS Panzer Corps placed near Paris, far enough inland to be useless to Rommel, but not far enough for von Rundstedt</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel moved those armoured formations under his command as far forward as possible, ordering General [[Erich Marcks]], commanding the 84th Corps defending the Normandy section, to move his reserves into the frontline</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel's strategy of an impregnable, armor-supported defense line was scoffed at by most of his fellow commanders including von Rundstedt, but his support from Hitler and Goebbels meant he could put all of it into effect except the Panzer divisions; however, these were, in his view, the most critical parts of the plan</span>
				<span class='text'>he Allies staged elaborate deceptions for [[D-Day]] (see [[Operation Fortitude]]), giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Hitler himself expected a Normandy invasion for a while, Rommel and most Army commanders in France believed there would be two invasions, with the main invasion coming at the Pas-de-Calais</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel drove defensive preparations all along the coast of Northern France, particularly concentrating fortification building in the [[River Somme]] estuary</span>
				<span class='text'>By D-Day on 6 June 1944 nearly all the German staff officers, including Hitler's staff, believed that Pas-de-Calais was going to be the main invasion site, and continued to believe so even after the landings in Normandy had occurred</span>

				<span class='text'>]A part of the difficulty in the German response to the landings in Northern France was a split command structure</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=67}} In addition, a great number of the land forces included units under the control of the Luftwaffe, including the paratrooper forces and various flak units, while others were under command of the Kriegsmarine</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=83}} On 4 June the chief meteorologist of the 3 Air Fleet reported that weather in the channel was so poor there could be no landing attempted for two weeks</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=223}} Several units, notably the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division]] and [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]], were near enough that they could have caused serious havoc</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Bomb blast damage following attempt to kill Hitler on 20 July 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>]Early in 1944, three of Rommel's closest friends—the ''Oberbürgermeister'' of Stuttgart, [[Karl Strölin]] (who had served with Rommel in the First World War), [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]], and [[Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel]]—began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler conspiracy</span>
				<span class='text'>They felt that as by far the most popular officer in Germany, he would lend their cause badly needed credibility with the populace</span>
				<span class='text'>Meetings between Rommel and them were organized by chief of staff [[Hans Speidel]], who also played a role in the daring letter Rommel wrote against Hitler</span>
				<span class='text'>Additionally, the conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Erwin von Witzleben]], who would have become commander-in-chief of the [[Wehrmacht]] if Hitler had been overthrown, was a field marshal, but had not been on active duty since 1942</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1031}}Rommel opposed assassinating Hitler</span>
				<span class='text'>After the war, his widow—among others—maintained that Rommel believed an assassination attempt would spark civil war in Germany and Austria, and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting cause</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Speidel|1950|pp=68, 73}} Instead, Rommel insisted that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>After the failed [[20 July Plot|bomb attack of 20 July]], many conspirators were arrested and the dragnet expanded to anyone even suspected of participating</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not take long for Rommel's involvement to come to light</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=236}} Later, another conspirator, [[Caesar von Hofacker]], admitted under particularly severe Gestapo interrogation that Rommel was actively involved</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1076}}Additionally, [[Carl Goerdeler]], the main civilian leader of the Resistance, wrote on several letters and other documents that Rommel was a potential supporter and an acceptable military leader to be placed in a position of responsibility should their coup succeed</span>
				<span class='text'>Nazi party officials in France reported that Rommel extensively and scornfully criticised Nazi incompetence and crimes</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=967}}Two generals from Hitler's headquarters, [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]] and [[Ernst Maisel]], visited Rommel at his home on 14 October 1944</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=110}}Friedrich von Mellenthin, who was a key aide on Rommel's staff during the Africa campaign, wrote that Rommel was willing to take chances, sometimes gambling an entire battle on a decision made at the point of contact</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel first displayed this type of initiative during the First World War as a junior officer in Belgium and later in the mountains of northern Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>There he found a sudden, bold, decisive move could reap large dividends</span>
				<span class='text'>This was reinforced by Rommel's experiences at the head of the 7th Panzer Division during the invasion of France in 1940, where it was clear that his presence at the forefront of the battle was instrumental in creating successful outcomes</span>
				<span class='text'>But at times in North Africa his absence from a position of communication made command of the battles of the Afrika Korps very difficult</span>
				<span class='text'>Rommel's counterattack during Operation ''Crusader'' is one such instance</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|von Mellenthin|1956|p=88}} It should be noted though, that throughout the desert war Rommel was acting from a position of relative weakness</span>
				<span class='text'>To succeed he had to accept risks that commanders like Montgomery were never forced to take</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=}}  General Fritz Bayerlein, Rommel's chief of staff through much of the campaign, noted that risks taken were made only after carefully weighing the potential dangers and rewards</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|von Luck|1989|p=38}} Though Mellenthin was in agreement on forward command of armoured units, a broadly held principle of the [[Panzerwaffe]], he believed that losing contact with headquarters led to disinvolvement of his staff officers and created difficulty in maintaining an overview of the tactical situation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|von Mellenthin|1956|p=24}}  Long absences from contact with headquarters meant that at times subordinate commanders had to make decisions without first consulting Rommel</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Rommel with German and Italian officers, 1942]]Rommel's contemptuous opinion of the Italian military stemmed initially from his experiences fighting against them in the mountains of [[Northern Italy]] in the First World War</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=28}}  His initial disdain was tempered when he came to realise their lack of success was principally due to poor leadership and equipment, remarking succinctly in his typical fashion: &quot;Good soldiers, bad officers</span>

				<span class='text'>Rommel was sent to Africa to shore up a crumbling situation created under the direction of the Italian command, and though he was nominally subordinate to the Italians for much of the campaign, he was under no illusions as to why he was there</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, he enjoyed direct access with the highest German political authority, which allowed him a certain degree of autonomy from his Italian counterparts; since he was directing their troops in battle as well as his own, this was bound to cause hostility among Italian commanders</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversely, as the Italian command had control over the supplies of the forces in Africa, they resupplied Italian units preferentially, which was a source of resentment for Rommel and his staff</span>
