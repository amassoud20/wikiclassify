				<span class='text'>These remarks from Arafat indicated a shift away from one of the PLO's primary aims—the destruction of Israel (as entailed in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]])–and toward the establishment of two separate entities: an Israeli state within the 1949 armistice lines, and an Arab state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip</span>

				<span class='text'>He made this decision without the consent of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO</span>
				<span class='text'>Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the [[Abu Nidal|Abu Nidal Organization]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition</span>
				<span class='text'>Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace</span>
