				<span class='text'>They moved to Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a name for himself as a filmmaker</span>
				<span class='text'>=Business career=={{Main|Summa Corporation}}Hughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation, and filmmaking, though many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles</span>
				<span class='text'>The Summa Corporation was the name adopted for the business interests of Howard Hughes after he sold the tool division of [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1972</span>
				<span class='text'>The company serves as the principal holding company for Hughes's business ventures and investments</span>
				<span class='text'>It is primarily involved in aerospace and defense, electronics, mass media, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, but has maintained a strong presence in a wide variety of industries including real estate, petroleum drilling and oilfield services, consulting, entertainment, and mining</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of his fortune was later used for philanthropic causes, notably towards health care and medical research</span>
				<span class='text'>==Entertainment===Hughes entered the entertainment industry after dropping out of Rice University and moving to Los Angeles</span>
				<span class='text'>His first two films, ''Everybody's Acting'' (1927) and ''[[Two Arabian Knights]]'' (1928), were financial successes, the latter winning the first [[Academy Award for Best Director]] of a comedy picture</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'' (1928) and ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1931) were also nominated for [[Academy Awards]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million to make the flying film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930)</span>
				<span class='text'>It earned nearly $8 million, about double the production and advertising costs</span>
				<span class='text'>''Hell's Angels'' received one [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e produced another hit, ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), a production delayed by censors' concern over its violence</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[The Outlaw]]'' (1943) was completed in 1941 and featured [[Jane Russell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It also received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes designed a special [[bra]] for his leading lady, although Russell decided against wearing it</span>
				<span class='text'>===RKO===={{Main|RKO Pictures}}For a period of time in the 1940s to late 1950s, Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film and media industry where it then owned the RKO companies, including: RKO Pictures; RKO Studios; RKO Theatres, a chain of movie theatres; the RKO Radio Network, a network of radio stations</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1948, Hughes gained control of [[RKO]], a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring 25 percent of the outstanding stock from [[Floyd Odlum]]'s [[Atlas Corporation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Within weeks of taking control, he dismissed three-quarters of the work force, and production was shut down for six months in 1949 while he undertook the investigation of the politics of all remaining studio employees</span>
				<span class='text'>Completed pictures would be sent back for re-shooting if he felt that his star (especially female) was not properly presented, or if a film's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] politics were not sufficiently clear</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group with no experience in the industry disrupted studio operations even further</span>
				<span class='text'>ughes sold the RKO theaters in 1953 as settlement of the ''[[United States v</span>
				<span class='text'>Paramount Pictures, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>]'' [[antitrust]] case</span>
				<span class='text'>With the sale of the profitable theaters, the shaky status of the film studio became increasingly apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders became an increasing nuisance, charging him with financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement, especially because Hughes wanted to focus on his aircraft-manufacturing and TWA holdings during the [[Korean War]] years</span>
				<span class='text'>Eager to be rid of the distraction, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders</span>
				<span class='text'>e had gained near-total control of RKO by the end of 1954, at a cost of nearly $24&amp;nbsp;million, becoming the closest thing to a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades</span>
				<span class='text'>Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] for $25&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO</span>
				<span class='text'>He also retained Jane Russell's contract</span>
				<span class='text'>For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in motion pictures; his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed</span>
				<span class='text'>He reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million in personal profit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lasky 1989, p</span>
				<span class='text'>229</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;General Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming, though it made some attempts to continue producing films</span>
				<span class='text'>After a year and a half of mixed success, General Tire shut down film production at RKO for good at the end of January 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>The studio lots in Hollywood and [[Culver City]] were sold to [[Desilu Productions]] later that year for $6</span>
				<span class='text'>5&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>==Real estate==={{main|Howard Hughes Corporation}}Beyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful real estate investor</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in Las Vegas and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, the [[Hughes Tool Company]] purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal</span>
				<span class='text'>riginally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> was floated on the New York Stock Exchange under the Hughes Tool name</span>
				<span class='text'>This forced the remaining businesses of the &quot;original&quot; Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa</span>
				<span class='text'>The name &quot;Summa&quot;, Latin for &quot;highest&quot;, was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials)</span>
				<span class='text'>nitially staying in the Desert Inn, Hughes refused to vacate his room and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the organized crime connected venues and he quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas</span>
				<span class='text'>He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its Wild West roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city</span>
				<span class='text'>==Technology===[[File:Howard Hughes</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Hughes with his [[Boeing 100]] in the 1940s]]Another portion of Hughes's business interests lies in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot</span>
				<span class='text'>At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including [[Moye Stephens]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading [[Hughes Aircraft]] at the [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|airport in Glendale]], CA</span>
				<span class='text'>Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the [[Hughes H-1 Racer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane [[Flight airspeed record|airspeed record]] of {{convert|352|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} over his test course near [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[Giuseppe Motta (aviator)|Giuseppe Motta]] reached 362&amp;nbsp;mph in 1929 and [[George Stainforth]] reached 407</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;mph in 1931, both in seaplanes)</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual</span>
				<span class='text'>A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new [[transcontinental airspeed record]] by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in 7 hours, 28 minutes and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of 9 hours, 27 minutes)</span>
				<span class='text'>His average ground speed over the flight was {{convert|322|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}</span>

				<span class='text'>During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Hughes Helicopters]] division started in 1947 when [[helicopter]] manufacturer [[Kellett Autogiro Corporation|Kellett]] sold their latest design to Hughes for production</span>
				<span class='text'>The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1948, Hughes created a new division of the company, the [[Hughes Aerospace#Hughes Aerospace Group|Hughes Aerospace]] Group</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the [[Hughes Space and Communications Company#Hughes Space and Communications|Hughes Space and Communications Company]] in 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1953, Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization</span>
				<span class='text'>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5</span>
				<span class='text'> billion</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1997, General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to Raytheon and in 2000, sold Hughes Space &amp; Communications to Boeing</span>
				<span class='text'>A combination of Boeing, GM and Raytheon acquired the [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], where it focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information &amp; systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their workspace spans from basic research to product delivery</span>
				<span class='text'>It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high performance integrated circuits, high power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials</span>
				<span class='text'>===Airlines====In 1939, at the urging of [[Jack Frye]], president of [[Trans World Airlines]] ([[TWA]]), Hughes quietly purchased a majority share of TWA stock for nearly $7&amp;nbsp;million and took control of the airline</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon assuming ownership, Hughes was prohibited by federal law from building his own aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeking an aircraft that would perform better than TWA's fleet of [[Boeing 307|Boeing 307 Stratoliner]]s, Hughes and Frye approached Boeing's competitor, [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes had a good relationship with Lockheed since they had built the aircraft he used in his record flight around the world in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>Lockheed agreed to Hughes and Frye's request that the new aircraft be built in secrecy</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was the revolutionary [[Lockheed Constellation|Constellation]] and TWA purchased the first 40 of the new airliners off the production line</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1956, Hughes placed an order for 63 [[Convair 880]]s for TWA at a cost of $400&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Hughes was extremely wealthy at this time, outside creditors demanded that Hughes relinquish control of TWA in return for providing the money</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of TWA, although he owned 78% of the company and battled to regain control</span>
				<span class='text'>efore Hughes' removal, the TWA jet financing issue precipitated the end of Hughes' relationship with [[Noah Dietrich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Dietrich claimed Hughes developed a plan by which Hughes Tool Company profits would be inflated to sell the company for a windfall that would pay the bills for the 880s</span>
				<span class='text'>Dietrich agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan on the condition that Hughes agreed to a capital gains arrangement he had long promised Dietrich</span>
				<span class='text'>When Hughes balked, Dietrich resigned immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Noah&quot;, Dietrich quoted Hughes as replying, &quot;I cannot exist without you!&quot; Dietrich stood firm and eventually had to sue to retrieve personal possessions from his office after Hughes ordered it locked</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1966, a U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>federal court forced Hughes to sell his TWA shares because of concerns over conflict of interest between his ownership of both TWA and Hughes Aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>The sale of his TWA shares netted him a profit of $547&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1970, Hughes went back into the airline business, buying San Francisco-based [[Air West]] and renaming it [[Hughes Airwest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Air West had been formed in 1968 by the merger of [[Bonanza Air Lines]], [[Pacific Air Lines]] and [[West Coast Airlines]], all of which operated in the western U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> By the late 1970s, Hughes Airwest operated an all-jet fleet of [[Boeing 727-200]], [[Douglas DC-9-10]], and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jetliners serving an extensive route network in the western U</span>

				<span class='text'>=Personal life==In 1929 Hughes' wife, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes [[dating|dated]] many famous women, many of them decades-younger, including [[Billie Dove]], [[Faith Domergue]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Gene Tierney]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also proposed to [[Joan Fontaine]] several times, according to her autobiography ''No Bed of Roses''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jean Harlow]] accompanied him to the premiere of ''Hell's Angels'', but [[Noah Dietrich]] wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes apparently personally disliked Harlow</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1971 book, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes'', Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected Jane Russell, but never sought romantic involvement with her</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to [[sexual intercourse|bed]] her after a party</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again</span>
				<span class='text'>The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years</span>
				<span class='text'>Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, was quoted as saying &quot;I don't think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Later, when Tierney's daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe [[learning disability]], because of Tierney's being exposed to [[rubella]] during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses</span>
