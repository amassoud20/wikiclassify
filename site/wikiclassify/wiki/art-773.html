				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; U2's early sound was rooted in [[post-punk]] but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of [[popular music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals</span>
				<span class='text'>Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns</span>
				<span class='text'>he band formed at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>Within four years, they signed with [[Island Records]] and released their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>By the mid-1980s, U2 had become a top international act</span>
				<span class='text'>They were more successful as a touring act than they were at selling records until their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' which, according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', elevated the band's stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>xx&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to musical stagnation and criticism of their earnest image and musical direction in the late 1980s, U2 reinvented themselves with their 1991 album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', and the accompanying [[Zoo TV Tour]]; they integrated [[Electronic dance music|dance]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[alternative rock]] influences into their sound, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image</span>
				<span class='text'>They embraced similar experimentation for the remainder of the 1990s with varying levels of success</span>
				<span class='text'>U2 regained critical and commercial favour in the 2000s with the records ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' (2000) and ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group</span>

				<span class='text'>The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and he was &quot;phased out&quot; in March 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>During a farewell concert in the Presbyterian Church Hall in [[Howth]], which featured The Hype playing covers, Dik ceremonially walked offstage</span>

				<span class='text'>46–48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Averill]], a punk rock musician (with [[The Radiators from Space|The Radiators]]) and family friend of Clayton's, had suggested six potential names from which the band chose &quot;U2&quot; for its ambiguity and open-ended interpretations, and because it was the name that they disliked the least</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>44&lt;/ref&gt;On [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in 1978, U2 won a talent show in [[Limerick]]</span>
