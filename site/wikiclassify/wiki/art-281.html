				<span class='text'>et}}}}{{French literature sidebar}}'''Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Cocteau''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃  kɔkto|lang}}; 5 July 1889 – 11 October 1963) was a French writer, designer, playwright, artist and filmmaker</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau is best known for his novel ''[[Les Enfants Terribles]]'' (1929), and the films ''[[Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930), ''[[Les Parents terribles (film)|Les Parents Terribles]]'' (1948), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1946) and ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'' (1949)</span>
				<span class='text'>His circle of associates, friends and lovers included [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jean Hugo]], [[Jean Marais]], [[Henri Bernstein]], [[Yul Brynner]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Coco Chanel]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[María Félix]], [[Édith Piaf]], [[Panama Al Brown]], [[Colette]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Raymond Radiguet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Cocteau was born in [[Maisons-Laffitte]], Yvelines, a village near [[Paris]], to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eugénie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when Cocteau was nine</span>
				<span class='text'>He left home at fifteen</span>
				<span class='text'>He published his first volume of poems, ''Aladdin's Lamp'', at nineteen</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau soon became known in [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artistic circles as ''The Frivolous Prince'', the title of a volume he published at twenty-two</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Edith Wharton]] described him as a man &quot;to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City</span>

				<span class='text'>1910-1912]]In his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers [[Marcel Proust]], [[André Gide]], and [[Maurice Barrès]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1912, he collaborated with [[Léon Bakst]] on ''[[Le Dieu bleu]]'' for the [[Ballets Russes]]; the principal dancers being [[Tamara Karsavina]] and [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During [[World War I]] Cocteau served in the [[Red Cross]] as an ambulance driver</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the period in which he met the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], artists [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated</span>
				<span class='text'>Russian impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' in 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>It was produced by [[Diaghilev]], with sets by Picasso, the [[libretto]] by Apollinaire and the music by [[Erik Satie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie, [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Maurice Ravel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,&quot; wrote Cocteau, &quot;with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Cocteau wrote the libretto for [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', which had its original performance in the [[Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt]] in Paris on 30 May 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>n important exponent of [[avant-garde art]], Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as [[Les six]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named [[Le Boeuf sur le Toit (cabaret)|Le Boeuf sur le Toit]], a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking</span>
				<span class='text'>The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Marie Laurencin]], ''Portrait de Jean Cocteau'', 1921]]In 1918 he met the French poet [[Raymond Radiguet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service</span>
				<span class='text'>Admiring of Radiguet's great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend's works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of ''[[Le Diable au corps (novel)|Le Diable au corps]]'' (a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man), exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the &quot;[[Nouveau Monde]]&quot; literary prize</span>
				<span class='text'>Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James S</span>
				<span class='text'>Williams |title=Jean Cocteau |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Steegmuller&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Francis Steegmuller|title=Cocteau, A Biography|quote=Monsieur, I have just received your letter and must reply despite my regret at being unable to explain the inexplicable</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that my friendship for your son and my deep admiration for his gifts (which are becoming increasingly apparent) are of an uncommon intensity, and that from the outside it is hard to make out how far my feelings go</span>
				<span class='text'>His literary future is of primary consideration with me: he is a kind of prodigy</span>
				<span class='text'>Scandal would spoil all this freshness</span>
				<span class='text'>You cannot possibly believe for a second that I do not try to avoid that by all the means in my power|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;There is disagreement over Cocteau's reaction to Radiguet's sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to [[opium]] addiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of ''[[Les noces]]'' (''The Wedding'') by the [[Ballets Russes]] at [[Monte Carlo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau himself much later characterised his reaction as one of &quot;stupor and disgust</span>

				<span class='text'>k |date=11 October 1963 |accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the [[Monte Carlo Opera]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau's opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style</span>
				<span class='text'>His most notable book, ''[[Les Enfants Terribles]]'', was written in a week during a strenuous [[opium]] weaning</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''{{Ill|fr|Opium: Journal of drug rehabilitation|Opium : Journal d'une désintoxication}}'', he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Maritain's influence Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects</span>
				<span class='text'>=''The Human Voice''==Cocteau's experiments with the human voice peaked with his play ''[[The Human Voice|La Voix humaine]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The story involves one woman on stage speaking on the telephone with her (invisible and inaudible) departing lover, who is leaving her to marry another woman</span>
				<span class='text'>The telephone proved to be the perfect prop for Cocteau to explore his ideas, feelings, and &quot;algebra&quot; concerning human needs and realities in communication</span>
				<span class='text'>octeau acknowledged in the introduction to the script that the play was motivated, in part, by complaints from his actresses that his works were too writer/director-dominated and gave the players little opportunity to show off their full range of talents</span>
				<span class='text'>''La Voix humaine'' was written, in effect, as an extravagant aria for Madame [[Berthe Bovy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Before came ''[[Orphée]]'', later turned into one of his more successful films; after came ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|La Machine infernale]]'', arguably his most fully realized work of art</span>
				<span class='text'> ''La Voix humaine'' is deceptively simple — a woman alone on stage for almost one hour of non-stop theatre speaking on the telephone with her departing lover</span>
				<span class='text'>It is full of theatrical codes harking back to the Dadaists' Vox Humana experiments after [[World War One]], Alphonse de Lamartine's &quot;La Voix humaine&quot;, part of his larger work ''Harmonies poétiques et religieuses'' and the effect of the creation of the Vox Humana (&quot;voix humaine&quot;), an [[organ stop]] of the Regal Class by Church organ masters (late 16th century) that attempted to imitate the human voice but never succeeded in doing better than the sound of a male chorus at a distance</span>
				<span class='text'>eviews varied at the time and since but whatever the critique, the play represents Cocteau's state of mind and feelings towards his actors at the time: on the one hand, he wanted to spoil and please them; on the other, he was fed up by their diva antics and was ready for revenge</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also true that none of Cocteau's works has inspired as much imitation: [[Francis Poulenc]]'s opera ''[[La voix humaine]]'', [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s &quot;''opera buffa''&quot; ''[[The Telephone]]'' and [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s film version in Italian with [[Anna Magnani]] ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (1948)</span>
				<span class='text'>There has also been a long line of interpreters including [[Simone Signoret]], [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Liv Ullmann]] (in the play) and [[Julia Migenes]], [[Denise Duval]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Anja Silja]] and [[Felicity Lott]] (in the opera)</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to one theory about how Cocteau was inspired to write ''La Voix humaine'', he was experimenting with an idea by fellow French playwright [[Henri Bernstein]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Cocteau cast Marais in ''[[L'Éternel Retour|The Eternal Return]]'' (1943), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1946), ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' (1947), and ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'' (1949)</span>

				<span class='text'>In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führer's sexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Cocteau effusively praised Breker's sculptures in an article entitled 'Salut à Breker' published in 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had used his contacts to his failed attempt to save friends such as [[Max Jacob]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming [[French New Wave]] genre</span>

				<span class='text'>His final film, ''[[Testament of Orpheus|Le Testament d'Orphée]]'' (''The Testament of Orpheus'') (1960), featured appearances by Picasso and matador [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]], along with [[Yul Brynner]], who also helped finance the film</span>
