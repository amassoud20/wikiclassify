				<span class='text'>ager to restore his [[Byzantine empire|empire]] to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process he made alliances with the [[Pope Adrian IV|Pope]] and the resurgent [[Latin West|West]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He invaded the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]], although unsuccessfully</span>
				<span class='text'>The passage of the potentially dangerous [[Second Crusade]] was adroitly managed through his empire</span>
				<span class='text'> Manuel [[Manuel I Komnenos#Manuel in Antioch|established a Byzantine protectorate]] over the [[Crusader states]] of [[Outremer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Facing [[Muslim]] advances in the [[Holy Land]], he made common cause with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|participated in a combined invasion]] of [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel reshaped the political maps of the [[Balkans]] and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and Outremer under Byzantine [[hegemony]] and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east</span>
				<span class='text'>However, towards the end of his reign Manuel's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at [[Battle of Myriokephalon|Myriokephalon]], which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] position</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir|Byzantines recovered]] and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]], Myriokephalon proved to be [[Battle of Myriokephalon#Aftermath|the final, unsuccessful effort]] by the empire to recover the interior of [[Anatolia]] from the [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>alled ''ho Megas'' ({{lang|grc|ὁ Μέγας}}, translated as &quot;[[the Great]]&quot;) by the [[Greeks]], Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him</span>
				<span class='text'>He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, [[John Kinnamos]], in which every virtue is attributed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of &quot;the most blessed emperor of [[Constantinople]]&quot; in parts of the [[Western Christianity|Latin world]] as well</span>

				<span class='text'>Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the [[Komnenos|dynasty]] he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign</span>

				<span class='text'>]Manuel Komnenos was the fourth son of [[John II Komnenos]] and [[Piroska of Hungary]], so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father</span>

				<span class='text'>Having distinguished himself in his father's war against the Seljuk Turks, in 1143 Manuel was chosen as his successor by John, in preference to his elder surviving brother [[Isaac Komnenos (d</span>
				<span class='text'>1154)|Isaac]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After John died on 8 April 1143, his son, Manuel, was acclaimed emperor by the armies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gib72&quot;&gt;Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his succession was by no means assured: At his father's deathbed in the wilds of [[Cilicia]] far from Constantinople, he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>He still had to take care of his father's funeral, and tradition demanded he organise the foundation of a monastery on the spot where his father died</span>
				<span class='text'>Swiftly, he dispatched the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[John Axuch|John Axouch]] ahead of him, with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival, his brother Isaac, who was living in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia</span>
				<span class='text'>Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor's death had reached it</span>
				<span class='text'>He quickly secured the loyalty of the city, and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143, he was crowned by the new [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]], [[Michael II Kourkouas|Michael Kourkouas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days later, with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure, Manuel ordered the release of Isaac</span>

				<span class='text'>Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;The empire that Manuel inherited from his father had undergone great changes since its foundation by [[Constantine I|Constantine]], eight centuries before</span>
				<span class='text'>In the time of his predecessor [[Justinian I]] (527–565), parts of the former Western Roman Empire had been recovered including Italy, Africa and part of Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the empire had diminished greatly following this, the most obvious change had occurred in the 7th century: the soldiers of [[Islam]] had taken [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)#Middle Ages|Palestine]] and much of [[Syria]] away from the empire irrevocably</span>
				<span class='text'>They had then swept on westwards into what in the time of Constantine had been the western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]], in North Africa and Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>In the centuries since, the emperors had ruled over a realm that largely consisted of [[Asia Minor]] in the east, and the Balkans in the west</span>
				<span class='text'> In the late 11th century the Byzantine Empire entered a period of marked military and political decline, which had been arrested and largely reversed by the leadership of Manuel's grandfather and father</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet the empire that Manuel inherited was a polity facing formidable challenges</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of the 11th century, the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central [[Anatolia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>And in the [[Levant]], a new force had appeared – the [[Crusader states]] – who presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, more than at any time during the preceding centuries, the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PLBr&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantium|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britannica|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Second Crusade and Raynald of Châtillon=={{details|Second Crusade}}===Prince of Antioch===[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en</span>
				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|The County of Edessa in the context of the other states of the [[Near East]] in 1135</span>
				<span class='text'>]The first test of Manuel's reign came in 1144, when he was faced with a demand by [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]] for the cession of Cilician territories</span>
				<span class='text'>However, later that year the crusader [[County of Edessa]] was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic [[jihad]] under [[Imad ad-Din Atabeg Zengi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Raymond realized that immediate help from the west was out of the question</span>
				<span class='text'> With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat, there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>Swallowing his pride, he made the journey north to ask for the protection of the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>After submitting to Manuel, he was promised the support that he had requested, and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured</span>

				<span class='text'>Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 640&lt;/ref&gt; There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel's army defeated the Turks at [[Afyonkarahisar|Acroënus]], before capturing and destroying the fortified town of [[Philomelion]], removing its remaining Christian population</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tread640&quot; /&gt; The Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, [[Konya]], and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls</span>
				<span class='text'>Among Manuel's motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride</span>

				<span class='text'>Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 42&lt;/ref&gt; While on this campaign Manuel received a letter from [[Louis VII of France]] announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Arrival of the Second Crusade before Constantinople, portrayed in Jean Fouquet's painting from around 1455–1460, ''Arrivée des croisés à Constantinople''</span>
				<span class='text'>]Manuel was prevented from following up his early successes in the east, for events to the west meant that his presence was urgently required in the Balkans</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under [[Conrad III of Germany]] and [[Louis VII of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the [[First Crusade]], a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel's aunt, [[Anna Komnene]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AC333&quot;&gt;A</span>
				<span class='text'>Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;Many Byzantines feared the Crusade, a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory</span>
				<span class='text'>Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression</span>
				<span class='text'>This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame,  precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel took the precaution – which his grandfather had not taken – of making repairs to the [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]], and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories</span>
				<span class='text'>Conrad's army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two</span>
				<span class='text'>{Cref|a}} Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian Kinnamos describes a full-scale [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|clash]] between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad's army, outside the walls of Constantinople</span>
				<span class='text'>The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to [[Üsküdar|Damalis]] on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros</span>

				<span class='text'>65-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birkenmeier, p</span>
				<span class='text'>110&lt;/ref&gt;After 1147, however, the relations between the two leaders became friendlier</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law [[Bertha of Sulzbach]] he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against [[Roger II of Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;M621&quot;&gt;P</span>
				<span class='text'>Magdalino, ''The Byzantine Empire'', 621&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;R239&quot; /&gt;Manuel responded to this outrage in a characteristically energetic way</span>
				<span class='text'>In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Thoros II of Armenia|Thoros of Cilicia]], who had participated in the attack on Cyprus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;M67&quot;&gt;P</span>
				<span class='text'>Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 67&lt;/ref&gt; All the towns and cities of Cilicia fell to Manuel immediately, and Thoros himself was forced to flee into the mountains at the last moment: he is said to have survived by sheltering alone under rocks on a hillside, where an old shepherd would bring him food to keep him alive</span>
				<span class='text'>==Manuel in Antioch===Meanwhile, news of the advance of the [[Komnenian army|Byzantine army]] soon reached Antioch</span>
				<span class='text'>Realising that he had no hope of defeating Manuel, Raynald also knew that he could not expect any help from king [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Baldwin did not approve of Raynald's attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope</span>
				<span class='text'>He appeared before the Emperor, dressed in a sack with a rope tied around his neck, and begged for forgiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were &quot;disgusted&quot; by it</span>

				<span class='text'>At court Béla assumed the name Alexius and received the title of ''[[Despotism|Despot]]'', which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself</span>
				<span class='text'>However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1169, Manuel's young wife gave birth to a son, thus depriving Béla of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary)</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and Béla went home to take his throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always &quot;keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Béla III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;JWS372&quot; /&gt;==Relations with Russia==Manuel Komnenos attempted to draw the Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, and to a lesser extent Norman Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince [[Iziaslav II of Kiev]] was related to [[Géza II of Hungary]] and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] of [[Suzdal]] was Manuel's ally (''symmachos''), and [[Volodymyrko Volodarovych|Vladimirko]] of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] is described as Manuel's vassal (''hypospondos'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over [[Kiev]] and [[Yaroslav Osmomysl|Yaroslav]], the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1164-65 Manuel's cousin [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos]], the future emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and fled to the court of Yaroslav in Galicia</span>
				<span class='text'>This situation, holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165</span>
				<span class='text'>A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince [[Rostislav I of Kiev|Rostislav]], resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The restoration of relations with Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement</span>
				<span class='text'>One army crossed the [[Walachian Plain]] and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps ([[Southern Carpathians]]), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the [[Sirmium]] and [[Belgrade]] frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of [[Transylvania]] being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies</span>

				<span class='text'>This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that in the context of the wider struggle between the crusader states and the [[Islam]]ic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor</span>
				<span class='text'>It had become clear that the ailing [[Fatimid]] [[Caliphate]] of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states</span>
				<span class='text'>If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;M73&quot; /&gt;A successful invasion of Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Egypt was a rich province, and in the days of the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the [[Arabs]] in the 7th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains</span>

				<span class='text'>Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of [[Dorylaeum]] and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium</span>

				<span class='text'>Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 128&lt;/ref&gt;Yet Manuel's army of 35,000 men was large and unwieldy – according to a letter that Manuel sent to King [[Henry II of England]], the advancing column was ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) long</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Birkenmeier, p</span>

				<span class='text'>Just outside the entrance to the pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer</span>

				<span class='text'>On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]] at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass</span>

				<span class='text'>Since the Sultan had already failed to keep his side of the earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum</span>

				<span class='text'>Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 649&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire</span>
				<span class='text'>The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the [[Battle of Manzikert]], 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century</span>
				<span class='text'>In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks</span>

				<span class='text'>The controversy of 1156–57 concerned the interpretation of John's liturgy for the [[Eucharist]], &quot;Thou art He who offers and is offered and receives</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]]Three major theological controversies occurred during Manuel's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1156–1157 the question was raised whether [[Jesus|Christ]] had offered himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world to the [[God the Father|Father]] and to the [[Holy Spirit]] only, or also to [[Jesus Christ the Logos|the Logos]] (i</span>

				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Kurtz, ''History of the Christian Church to the Restoration'', 265–266&lt;/ref&gt; In the end a [[synod]] held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the [[Holy Trinity]], despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot; /&gt;Ten years later, a controversy arose as to whether the saying of Christ, &quot;My Father is greater than I&quot;, referred to his divine nature, to his human nature, or to the union of the two</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;K265-266&quot; /&gt; Demetrius of Lampe, a Byzantine diplomat recently returned from the West, ridiculed the way the verse was interpreted there, that Christ was inferior to his father in his humanity but equal in his divinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel, on the other hand, perhaps with an eye on the project for Church union, found that the formula made sense, and prevailed over a majority in a synod convened on 2 March 1166 to decide the issue, where he had the support of the patriarch [[Luke Chrysoberges]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot; /&gt; and later Patriarch [[Patriarch Michael III of Constantinople|Michael III]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 217&lt;/ref&gt;A third controversy sprung up in 1180, when Manuel objected to the formula of solemn [[abjuration]], which was exacted from Muslim converts</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the more striking [[anathema]]s of this abjuration was that directed against the deity worshipped by [[Muhammad]] and his followers:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson55&quot;&gt;G</span>

				<span class='text'>By the time he died in 1180, 37 years had passed since that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath</span>
				<span class='text'>Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century</span>
				<span class='text'>While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect</span>

				<span class='text'>However, in spite of his military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale</span>
				<span class='text'>His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish [[Sultanate]] of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the [[Peace of Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian Mark C</span>
				<span class='text'>Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies</span>

				<span class='text'>==Internal affairs===Choniates criticised Manuel for raising taxes and pointed to Manuel's reign as a period of excession; according to Choniates, the money thus raised was spent lavishly at the cost of his citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether one reads the Greek [[encomium|encomiastic]] sources, or the Latin and oriental sources, the impression is consistent with Choniates' picture of an emperor who spent lavishly in all available ways, rarely economising in one sector in order to develop another</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;P121&quot;/&gt; Manuel spared no expense on the army, the navy, diplomacy, ceremonial, palace-building, the Komnenian family, and other seekers of patronage</span>
				<span class='text'>A significant amount of this expenditure was pure financial loss to the Empire, like the subsidies poured into Italy and the crusader states, and the sums spent on the failed expeditions of 1155–1156, 1169, and 1176</span>

				<span class='text'>Had he been more successful in all his ventures, he would have controlled not only the most productive farmland around the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, but also the entire trading facilities of the area</span>
				<span class='text'>Even if he did not achieve his ambitious goals, his wars against Hungary brought him control of the Dalmatian coast, the rich agricultural region of Sirmium, and the Danube trade route from Hungary to the [[Black Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His Balkan expeditions are said to have taken great booty in slaves and livestock;&lt;ref name=&quot;M174&quot;&gt;P</span>

				<span class='text'>Indeed, it has been argued that Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] invasion during the reign of [[Heraclius|Herakleios]], some five hundred years earlier</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Manuel was further extolled by [[Robert de Clari|Robert of Clari]] as &quot;a right worthy man, [</span>

				<span class='text'>On the south wall, an inscription in Greek reads: &quot;the present work was finished by Ephraim the monk, painter and mosaicist, in the reign of the great emperor Manuel Porphyrogennetos Komnenos and in the time of the great king of Jerusalem, Amalric</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; That Manuel's name was placed first was a symbolic, public recognition of Manuel's overlordship as leader of the Christian world</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel's role as protector of the Orthodox Christians and Christian holy places in general is also evident in his successful attempts to secure rights over the Holy Land</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, where thanks to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day</span>
				<span class='text'>All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel was also the last Byzantine emperor who, thanks to his military and diplomatic success in the Balkans, could call himself &quot;ruler of Dalmatia, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages'', 372–373&lt;/ref&gt;Byzantium looked impressive when Manuel died in 1180, having just celebrated the betrothal of his son Alexios II to the daughter of the king of France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;M194&quot;&gt;P</span>
				<span class='text'>Magdalino, ''The Medieval Empire'', 194&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180</span>
				<span class='text'>Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury</span>
				<span class='text'>But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent ''[[coup d'état]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely</span>

				<span class='text'>2'' known as ''Manganeios Prodromos''), which was probably an imperial commission, and must have been written shortly after the Germans had crossed the [[Bosporus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Conrad is accused of wanting to take Constantinople by force, and to install a Latin patriarch (''Manganeios Prodromos'', no 20</span>

				<span class='text'>His unilateral pursuit, however, antagonized the new German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, whose own plans for imperial restoration ruled out any partnership with Byzantium</span>
				<span class='text'>Manuel was thus obliged to treat Frederick as his main enemy, and to form a web of relationships with other western powers, including the papacy, his old enemy, the Norman kingdom, Hungary, several magnates and cities throughout Italy, and, above all, the crusader states</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;M194&quot; /&gt;}}{{Cnote|c|Magdalino underscores that, whereas John had removed the Rupenid princes from power in Cilicia twenty years earlier, Manuel allowed Toros to hold most of his strongholds he had taken, and effectively restored only the coastal area to imperial rule</span>
				<span class='text'>From Raynald, Manuel secured recognition of imperial suzerainty over Antioch, with the promise to hand over the citadel, to instal a [[Patriarch of Antioch|patriarch]] sent from Constantinople (not actually implemented until 1165–66), and to provide troops for the emperor's service, but nothing seems to have been said about the reversion of Antioch to direct imperial rule</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Magdalino, this suggests that Manuel had dropped this demand on which both his grandfather and father insisted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;M67&quot; /&gt; For his part, Medieval historian [[Zachary Nugent Brooke]] believes that the victory of Christianity against Nur ad-Din was made impossible, since both Greeks and Latins were concerned primarily with their own interests</span>
				<span class='text'>He characterises the policy of Manuel as &quot;short-sighted&quot;, because &quot;he lost a splendid opportunity of recovering the former possessions of the Empire, and by his departure threw away most of the actual fruits of his expedition&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Brooke, ''A History of Europe, from 911 to 1198'', 482&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Piers Paul Read]], Manuel's deal with Nur ad-Din was for the Latins another expression of Greeks' [[perfidy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Basil answered that there was no division between the Greeks and Latins, since they held the same faith and offered the same sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;As for the causes of scandal, weak in themselves, that have separated us from each other&quot;, he added, &quot;your Holiness can cause them to cease, by your own extended authority and the help of the Emperor of the West</span>
