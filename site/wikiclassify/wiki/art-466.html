				<span class='text'>nce he had set up in private practice in 1886, Freud began using hypnosis in his clinical work</span>
				<span class='text'>He adopted the approach of his friend and collaborator, [[Josef Breuer]], in a use of hypnosis which was different from the French methods he had studied in that it did not use suggestion</span>

				<span class='text'>reud’s clinical work eventually led him to the conclusion that more consistent and effective symptom relief, compared to that achieved by using hypnosis, could be obtained by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them</span>
				<span class='text'>In conjunction with this procedure, which he called &quot;[[free association (psychology)|free association]]&quot;, Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of [[Psychological repression|repression]] which underlay symptom formation</span>

				<span class='text'>His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother's affections led him to a fundamental revision of his theory of the origin of the neuroses</span>
				<span class='text'>n the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as [[Freud's seduction theory]]</span>

				<span class='text'>203, 211, 219; Eissler 2005, p</span>
				<span class='text'>96&lt;/ref&gt; In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis can be traced back to the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories</span>

				<span class='text'>75-76&lt;/ref&gt;This transition from the theory of infantile sexual trauma as a general explanation of how all neuroses originate to one that presupposes an autonomous infantile sexuality provided the basis for Freud's subsequent formulation of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gay 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>88-96&lt;/ref&gt;Freud described the evolution of his clinical method and set out his theory of the psychogenetic origins of hysteria, demonstrated in a number of case histories, in ''Studies on Hysteria'' published in 1895 (co-authored with [[Josef Breuer]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1899 he published ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in which, following a critical review of existing theory, Freud gives detailed interpretations of his own and his patients' dreams in terms of [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillments]] made subject to the repression and censorship of the &quot;dream work&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He then sets out the theoretical model of mental structure (the unconscious, pre-conscious and conscious) on which this account is based</span>
				<span class='text'>An abridged version, ''On Dreams'', was published in 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>In works which would win him a more general readership, Freud applied his theories outside the clinical setting in ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' (1901) and ''[[Humor in Freud|Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (1905)</span>

				<span class='text'>he committee continued to function until 1927 by which time institutional developments within the IPA, such as the establishment of the International Training Commission, served to allay some of Freud's anxieties about the transmission of psychoanalytic theory and practice</span>
				<span class='text'>he final defection from Freud's inner circle occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's ''[[The Trauma of Birth]]'' which other members of the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the Oedipus Complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris</span>

				<span class='text'>Freud initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, telling him that the growth had been removed</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud consulted the [[dermatologist]] Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism &quot;a bad leukoplakia&quot; instead of the technical diagnosis [[epithelioma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a [[rhinologist]] whose competence he had previously questioned</span>

				<span class='text'>592-3&lt;/ref&gt;Freud continued to maintain his optimistic underestimation of the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the [[Anschluss]] of 13 March 1938, in which Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent [[anti-Semitism]] that ensued</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gay618&gt;Gay 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>618–620, 624–625&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest Jones, the then president of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud to change his mind and seek exile in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>This prospect and the shock of the detention and interrogation of Anna Freud by the Gestapo finally convinced Freud it was time to leave Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Gay618/&gt; Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of émigrés for whom immigration permits would be required</span>
				<span class='text'>Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] to expedite the granting of permits</span>
				<span class='text'>There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the [[Royal Society]],&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot;/&gt; [[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]], to write to the Foreign Secretary [[Lord Halifax]], requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf</span>

				<span class='text'>152–153&lt;/ref&gt;The departure from Vienna began in stages throughout April and May 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud's grandson Ernst Halberstadt and Freud's son Martin's wife and children left for Paris in April</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud's sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, left for London on 5 May, Martin Freud the following week and Freud's daughter Mathilde and her husband, Robert Hollitscher, on 24 May</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2009, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>157–159&lt;/ref&gt;By the end of the month, arrangements for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>The Nazi-appointed ''Kommissar'' put in charge of his assets and those of the IPA proved to be sympathetic to Freud's plight</span>
				<span class='text'>Anton Sauerwald had studied chemistry at [[Vienna University]] under Professor [[Josef Herzig]], an old friend of Freud's, and evidently retained, notwithstanding his [[Nazi Party]] allegiance, a respect for Freud's professional standing</span>
				<span class='text'>Expected to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to follow their instructions to destroy the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, in the event Sauerwald did neither, removing evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranging the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>160&lt;/ref&gt;Though Sauerwald's intervention lessened the financial burden of the &quot;flight&quot; tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of the IPA and the valuable collection of antiquities Freud possessed</span>
				<span class='text'>Unable to access his own accounts, Freud turned to [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], the most eminent and wealthy of his French followers, who had travelled to Vienna to offer her support and it was she who made the necessary funds available</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2009, p</span>
				<span class='text'>166&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Sauerwald to sign the necessary exit visas for Freud, his wife Martha and daughter Anna</span>
				<span class='text'>They left Vienna on the [[Orient Express]] on 4 June, accompanied by their household staff and a doctor, arriving in Paris the following day where they stayed as guests of Princess Bonaparte before travelling overnight to London arriving at Victoria Station on 6 June</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud's ashes at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]]]]By mid-September 1939, Freud's cancer of the jaw was causing him increasingly severe pain and had been declared to be inoperable</span>
				<span class='text'>The last book he read, [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'', prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, [[Max Schur]], reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: &quot;Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come</span>
				<span class='text'>Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, &quot;I thank you,&quot; and then &quot;Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3am on 23 September 1939</span>

				<span class='text'>650-51&lt;/ref&gt; However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud’s final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud’s main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account</span>
				<span class='text'> This proposes that Schur was absent from Freud’s deathbed when a third and final dose of morphine was administered by Dr Josephine Stross, a colleague of Anna Freud’s, leading to Freud’s death around midnight on 23 September 1939</span>

				<span class='text'>He intervened in the important debates about [[aphasia]] with his monograph of 1891, ''Zur Auffassung der Aphasien'', in which he coined the term [[agnosia]] and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his contemporary [[Eugen Bleuler]], he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure</span>
				<span class='text'>reud was also an early researcher in the field of [[cerebral palsy]], which was then known as &quot;cerebral paralysis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He published several medical papers on the topic, and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suggested that [[William John Little]], the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique</span>
				<span class='text'>The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into [[consciousness]] in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>lassically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so</span>

				<span class='text'>9&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element of psychoanalysis is [[transference]], the process by which patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as an essential part of the therapeutic process</span>

				<span class='text'>85–186&lt;/ref&gt;The origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to [[Josef Breuer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of [[Anna O</span>
				<span class='text'>] In November 1880, Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman ([[Bertha Pappenheim]]) for a persistent cough that he diagnosed as hysterical</span>
				<span class='text'>He found that while nursing her dying father, she had developed a number of transitory symptoms, including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs, which he also diagnosed as hysterical</span>
				<span class='text'>Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent, and observed that she entered states of ''absence''</span>
				<span class='text'>He found that when, with his encouragement, she told fantasy stories in her evening states of ''absence'' her condition improved, and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again</span>
				<span class='text'>Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously, and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the years immediately following Breuer's treatment, Anna O</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Freud's later accounts of this period, as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early [[childhood sexual abuse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]], but then he came to believe that they were fantasies</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained these at first as having the function of &quot;fending off&quot; memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate [[Drive theory|drives]] that are sexual and destructive in nature</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===The Unconscious==={{Main|Unconscious mind}}The concept of the unconscious was central to Freud's account of the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud believed that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence of the unconscious, he had ensured that it received scientific recognition in the field of psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>The concept made an informal appearance in Freud's writings</span>
				<span class='text'>he unconscious was first introduced in connection with the phenomenon of repression, to explain what happens to ideas that are repressed</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud stated explicitly that the concept of the unconscious was based on the theory of repression</span>
				<span class='text'>He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of traumatic hysteria, which revealed cases where the behavior of patients could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness</span>
				<span class='text'>This fact, combined with the observation that such behavior could be artificially induced by hypnosis, in which ideas were inserted into people's minds, suggested that ideas were operative in the original cases, even though their subjects knew nothing of them</span>
				<span class='text'>reud, like Josef Breuer, found the hypothesis that hysterical manifestations were generated by ideas to be not only warranted, but given in observation</span>
				<span class='text'>Disagreement between them arose when they attempted to give causal explanations of their data: Breuer favored a hypothesis of [[hypnoid state]]s, while Freud postulated the [[Defence mechanisms|mechanism of defense]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Richard Wollheim]] comments that given the close correspondence between hysteria and the results of hypnosis, Breuer's hypothesis appears more plausible, and that it is only when repression is taken into account that Freud's hypothesis becomes preferable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WollheimChap6&quot; /&gt;Freud originally allowed that repression might be a conscious process, but by the time he wrote his second paper on the &quot;Neuro-Psychoses of Defence&quot; (1896), he apparently believed that repression, which he referred to as &quot;the psychical mechanism of (unconscious) defense&quot;, occurred on an unconscious level</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud further developed his theories about the unconscious in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899) and in ''[[Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (1905), where he dealt with condensation and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] as inherent characteristics of unconscious mental activity</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud presented his first systematic statement of his hypotheses about unconscious mental processes in 1912, in response to an invitation from the London Society of Psychical Research to contribute to its ''Proceedings''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1915, Freud expanded that statement into a more ambitious metapsychological paper, entitled &quot;The Unconscious&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In both these papers, when Freud tried to distinguish between his conception of the unconscious and those that predated psychoanalysis, he found it in his postulation of ideas that are simultaneously latent and operative</span>

				<span class='text'>London, Fontana Press, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>157-176&lt;/ref&gt;===Dreams==={{Main|Dream}}Freud believed that the function of dreams is to preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled wishes that would otherwise awaken the dreamer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rycroft, Charles</span>
				<span class='text'>''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Penguin Books, 1995, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;In Freud's theory dreams are instigated by the daily occurrences and thoughts of everyday life</span>
				<span class='text'>His claim that they function as wish fulfillments is based on an account of the “dreamwork&quot; in terms of a transformation of &quot;secondary process&quot; thought, governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, into the &quot;primary process&quot; of unconscious thought governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: NLB 1971, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>55-58&lt;/ref&gt;In order to preserve sleep the dreamwork disguises the repressed or “latent&quot; content of the dream in an interplay of words and images which Freud describes in terms of condensation, displacement and distortion</span>
				<span class='text'>This produces the &quot;manifest content&quot; of the dream as recounted in the dream narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>For Freud an unpleasant manifest content may still represent the fulfilment of a wish on the level of the latent content</span>
				<span class='text'>In the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content in order to facilitate access to its latent content</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud believed interpreting dreams in this way could provide important insights into the formation of neurotic symptoms and contribute to the mitigation of their pathological effects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gay 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>108-117&lt;/ref&gt;===Psychosexual development==={{Main|Psychosexual development}}Freud's theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial [[polymorphous perversity]] of infantile sexuality, the sexual &quot;drives&quot; pass through the distinct developmental phases of the [[oral stage|oral]], the [[anal stage|anal]] and the [[phallic stage|phallic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though these phases then give way to a [[The Latency Phase (6-12 years of age)|latency stage]] of reduced sexual interest and activity (from around the age of approximately five up until puberty), they leave, to a greater or lesser extent, a &quot;perverse&quot; and bisexual residue which persists during the formation of adult genital sexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud argued that [[neurosis]] or [[perversion]] could be explained in terms of fixation or regression to these phases whereas adult character and cultural creativity could achieve a [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] of their perverse residue</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mannoni 1971, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>93-97&lt;/ref&gt;After Freud's later development of the theory of the [[Oedipus Complex]] this normative developmental trajectory becomes formulated in terms of the child's renunciation of incestuous desires under the phantasised threat of (or phantasised fact of, in the case of the girl) castration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gay 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>515-18&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;dissolution&quot; of the Oedipus Complex is then achieved when the child's rivalrous identification with the parental figure is transformed into the pacifying identifications of the [[Ego ideal]] which assume both similarity and difference and acknowledge the separateness and autonomy of the other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cavell, Marcia ''The Psychoanalytic Mind'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press 1996, p</span>
				<span class='text'>225&lt;/ref&gt;Freud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and turned to ancient mythology and contemporary ethnography for comparative material arguing that totemism reflected a ritualized enactment of a tribal Oedipal conflict</span>

				<span class='text'>The death drive was also termed &quot;Thanatos&quot;, although Freud did not use that term; &quot;Thanatos&quot; was introduced in this context by [[Paul Federn]]</span>

				<span class='text'>&amp;2, Winter &amp; Spring 2003 ER&lt;/ref&gt;In ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud inferred the existence of the death instinct</span>
				<span class='text'>Its premise was a regulatory principle that has been described as &quot;the principle of psychic inertia&quot;, &quot;the Nirvana principle&quot;, and &quot;the conservatism of instinct&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Its background was Freud's earlier ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'', where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wollheim&quot;&gt;Wollheim, Richard</span>
				<span class='text'>''Freud''</span>
				<span class='text'>London, Fontana Press, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>184–186&lt;/ref&gt;Freud in effect readopted the original definition in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', this time applying it to a different principle</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it could eliminate tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself to a state of extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the compulsion to repeat</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play</span>
				<span class='text'>In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus &quot;beyond&quot; the pleasure principle</span>
				<span class='text'>If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions</span>
				<span class='text'>By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wollheim&quot; /&gt;===Femininity and female sexuality===Initiating what became the first debate within psychoanalysis on femininity, [[Karen Horney]] of the Berlin Institute set out to challenge Freud's account of the development of feminine sexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Rejecting Freud's theories of the feminine [[castration complex]] and [[penis envy]], Horney argued for a primary femininity and penis envy as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or &quot;injury&quot;, of biological asymmetry as Freud held</span>
				<span class='text'>Horney had the influential support of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Ernest Jones]] who coined the term &quot;[[phallogocentrism|phallocentrism]]&quot; in his critique of Freud's position</span>

				<span class='text'>London: Penguin Books, 1992, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>433-437&lt;/ref&gt;In defending Freud against this critique, feminist scholar [[Jacqueline Rose]] has argued that it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud</span>
				<span class='text'>She notes that Freud moved from a description of the little girl stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' in the face of the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life</span>

				<span class='text'>''Sexuality in the Field of Vision'', London: Verso 1986 p</span>
				<span class='text'>91-93&lt;/ref&gt;According to Freud, &quot;Elimination of clitoral sexuality is a necessary precondition for the development of femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation</span>
				<span class='text'>This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The [[neo-Freudian]]s, a group including [[Alfred Adler]], [[Otto Rank]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] and [[Erich Fromm]], rejected Freud's theory of instinctual drive, emphasized interpersonal relations and self-assertiveness, and made modifications to therapeutic practice that reflected these theoretical shifts</span>
				<span class='text'>Adler originated the approach, although his influence was indirect due to his inability to systematically formulate his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kovel's view, neo-Freudian practice shares the same assumption as most current therapeutic approaches in the United States: &quot;If what is wrong with people follows directly from bad experience, then therapy can be in its basics nothing but good experience as a corrective</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Neo-Freudian analysis therefore places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration of the unconscious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kovel&quot; /&gt;[[Carl Jung]] believed that the [[collective unconscious]], which reflects the cosmic order and the history of the human species, is the most important part of the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>It contains [[archetype]]s, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person</span>
				<span class='text'>The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits</span>
				<span class='text'>Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life</span>
				<span class='text'>His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the [[anima and animus|anima]] (a man's suppressed female self), the [[anima and animus|animus]] (a woman's suppressed male self), or the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kovel&quot; /&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]] approached psychoanalysis through [[linguistics]] and literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Lacan believed that Freud's essential work had been done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language and its relation to experience and subjectivity, and that [[ego psychology]] and [[object relations theory]] were based upon misreadings of Freud's work</span>
				<span class='text'>For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language</span>
				<span class='text'>Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable</span>

				<span class='text'>193–203&lt;/ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]] developed ideas that Freud had developed at the beginning of his psychoanalytic investigation but then superseded but never finally discarded</span>
				<span class='text'>These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido</span>
				<span class='text'>In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the &quot;actual&quot;) determined the resulting neurotic disposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults</span>
				<span class='text'>In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance</span>
				<span class='text'>By the 1920s, Reich had &quot;taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Reich was also &quot;developing his ideas about character into a form that would later take shape, first as &quot;muscular armour&quot;, and eventually as a transducer of universal biological energy, the &quot;orgone&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovel&quot; /&gt;[[Fritz Perls]], who helped to develop [[Gestalt therapy]], was influenced by Reich, Jung and Freud</span>
				<span class='text'>The key idea of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, &quot;an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>between an organism and its environment</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; These wholes, called ''gestalts'', are &quot;patterns involving all the layers of organismic function – thought, feeling, and activity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Neurosis is seen as splitting in the formation of gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing &quot;the struggle towards its creative unification</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with &quot;immediate organismic needs</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated &quot;workshops&quot; rather than being spread out over a long period of time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kovel&quot; /&gt;[[Arthur Janov]]'s [[primal therapy]], which has been an influential post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but nevertheless has profound differences with it</span>
				<span class='text'>While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, he does not have a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and cured them by unknotting their repression</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Crews sees Freud as having anticipated the [[recovered memory]] movement's &quot;puritanical alarmism&quot; by emphasizing &quot;mechanical cause-and-effect relations between symptomatology and the premature stimulation of one body zone or another&quot;, and with pioneering its &quot;technique of thematically matching a patient's symptom with a sexually symmetrical 'memory</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; Crews believes that Freud's confidence in accurate recall of early memories anticipates the theories of recovered memory therapists such as [[Lenore Terr]], which in his view have led to people being wrongfully imprisoned or involved in litigation</span>
