				<span class='text'>Only two months after graduation, he published his first [[scientific paper|paper]], on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He attended the [[Ludwig-Maximilians University]] in [[Munich]], working under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]],&lt;ref name=peierls/&gt; where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in July 1921 for his thesis on the quantum theory of [[Dihydrogen cation|ionized diatomic hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2|+}})</span>

				<span class='text'>Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages</span>

				<span class='text'>From 1923 to 1928, he was a lecturer at the [[University of Hamburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Pauli was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, he formulated the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] and the theory of nonrelativistic [[spin (physics)|spin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1928, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Switzerland]] where he made significant scientific progress</span>
				<span class='text'>He held visiting professorships at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1931, and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] in 1935</span>

				<span class='text'>He soon began to criticize the [[epistemology]] of Jung's theory scientifically, and this contributed to a certain clarification of the latter's thoughts, especially about the concept of [[synchronicity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A great many of these discussions are documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as ''Atom and Archetype''</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and Wolfgang Pauli, ''ca''</span>
				<span class='text'>1935]]Pauli made many important contributions in his career as a physicist, primarily in the field of [[quantum mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues such as [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], with whom he had close friendships</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients</span>
				<span class='text'>auli proposed in 1924 a new quantum degree of freedom (or [[quantum number]]) with two possible values, in order to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics</span>
				<span class='text'>He formulated the Pauli exclusion principle, perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea of spin originated with [[Ralph Kronig]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] one year later identified Pauli's new degree of freedom as [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1926, shortly after Heisenberg published the [[Matrix mechanics|matrix theory]] of modern [[quantum mechanics]], Pauli used it to derive the observed spectrum of the [[hydrogen atom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg's theory</span>
				<span class='text'>auli introduced the 2 × 2 [[Pauli matrices]] as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin</span>
				<span class='text'>This work is sometimes said to have influenced [[Paul Dirac]] in his creation of the [[Dirac equation]] for the [[relativistic particle|relativistic]] electron, though Dirac stated that he invented these same matrices himself independently at the time, without Pauli's influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Dirac invented similar but larger (4x4) spin matrices for use in his relativistic treatment of fermionic spin</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1930, Pauli considered the problem of [[beta decay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter of 4 December to [[Lise Meitner]] ''et al</span>
				<span class='text'>', beginning, &quot;[[Electron neutrino#Pauli's letter|Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen]]&quot;, he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass, no greater than 1% the mass of a proton, in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta decay</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1934, [[Enrico Fermi]] incorporated the particle, which he called a [[neutrino]], into his theory of beta decay</span>
				<span class='text'>The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by [[Frederick Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]], two and a half years before Pauli's death</span>
				<span class='text'>On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: &quot;Thanks for message</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1949, he published a paper on [[Pauli–Villars regularization]]: regularization is the term for techniques which modify infinite mathematical integrals to make them finite during calculations, so that one can identify whether the intrinsically infinite quantities in the theory (mass, charge, wavefunction) form a finite and hence calculable set which can be redefined in terms of their experimental values, which criterion is termed [[renormalization]], and which removes infinities from [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], but also importantly allows the calculation of higher order corrections in perturbation theory</span>

				<span class='text'>1945]]The [[Pauli effect]] was named after the anecdotal bizarre ability of his to break experimental equipment simply by being in the vicinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauli was aware of his reputation and was delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested</span>
				<span class='text'>These strange occurrences were in line with his investigations into the legitimacy of [[parapsychology]], particularly his collaboration with C</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Jung on the concept of [[synchronicity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>egarding physics, Pauli was famously a perfectionist</span>
				<span class='text'>This extended not just to his own work, but also to the work of his colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he became known in the physics community as the &quot;conscience of physics,&quot; the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable</span>
				<span class='text'>He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it ''ganz falsch'', utterly false</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable and, thus, [[Pseudoscience|not properly belonging within the realm of science]], even though posing as such</span>
				<span class='text'>They were worse than wrong because they could not be proven wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: ''It is [[not even wrong]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=peierls&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peierls | first1 = Rudolf | authorlink1 = Rudolf Peierls | year = 1960 | title = Wolfgang Ernst Pauli 1900-1958 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = Royal Society | jstor =  | doi = 10</span>

				<span class='text'>The two met at a conference for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>Ehrenfest was familiar with Pauli's papers and was quite impressed with them</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few minutes of conversation, Ehrenfest remarked, &quot;I think I like your Encyclopedia article [on relativity theory] better than I like you,&quot; to which Pauli shot back, &quot;That's strange</span>
				<span class='text'>With me, regarding you, it is just the opposite</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The two became very good friends from then on</span>
				<span class='text'> somewhat warmer picture emerges from this story which appears in the article on Dirac:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Werner Heisenberg [in ''Physics and Beyond'', 1971] recollects a friendly conversation among young participants at the 1927 [[Solvay Conference]], about Einstein and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s views on religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it</span>
				<span class='text'>Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other things, Dirac said: &quot;I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion</span>
				<span class='text'>If we are honest – and as scientists honesty is our precise duty – we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation</span>
				<span class='text'>The very idea of God is a product of human imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; Heisenberg's view was tolerant</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks</span>
				<span class='text'>But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: &quot;Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet'&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Many of Pauli's ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients</span>
				<span class='text'>Pauli may have been unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited, but when it came to Heisenberg's world-renowned 1958 lecture at Göttingen on their joint work on a unified field theory, and the press release calling Pauli a mere &quot;assistant to Professor Heisenberg&quot;, Pauli became offended, shooting back several times at CERN and elsewhere by denouncing Heisenberg's physics prowess</span>
				<span class='text'>The deterioration between them resulted in Heisenberg ignoring Pauli's funeral, and writing in his autobiography that Pauli's criticisms were overwrought</span>
