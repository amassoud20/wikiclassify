				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; was [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] from 6 April 1199 until his death in 1216</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the [[battle of Bouvines]], John lost the [[duchy of Normandy]] to King [[Philip II of France]], which resulted in the collapse of most of the [[Angevin Empire]] and contributed to the subsequent growth in power of the [[Capetian dynasty]] during the 13th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[First Barons' War|baronial revolt]] at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', a document sometimes considered to be an early step in the evolution of the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ohn, the youngest of five sons of King [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], was at first not expected to inherit significant lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed the [[Lord of Ireland]] in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent</span>
				<span class='text'>John's elder brothers [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] and [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] died young; by the time [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the [[Third Crusade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, after Richard died in 1199, John was proclaimed King of England, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace [[treaty of Le Goulet]] in 1200</span>
				<span class='text'>hen war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of [[Normans|Norman]], [[Breton people|Breton]] and [[Anjou]] nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204</span>
				<span class='text'>John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances</span>
				<span class='text'>John's judicial reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue</span>
				<span class='text'>An argument with [[Pope Innocent III]] led to John's [[excommunication]] in 1209, a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213</span>
				<span class='text'>John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the [[battle of Bouvines]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>Although both John and the barons agreed to the ''Magna Carta'' peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>[[First Barons' War|Civil war]] broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by [[Louis VIII of France|Louis of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It soon descended into a stalemate</span>
				<span class='text'>John died of [[dysentery]] contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>ontemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian [[Jim Bradbury]] has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bradbury 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53&quot;&gt;Bradbury (2007), p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the [[Victorian literature|Victorian era]], and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the [[Robin Hood]] legends</span>

				<span class='text'>vg|thumb|300px|alt=A coloured map of medieval France, showing the Angevin territories in the west, the royal French territories in the east, and the Duchy of Toulouse in the south</span>
				<span class='text'>The Angevin continental empire (orange shades) in the late 12th century]]{{Main|Angevin Empire}}John was born to [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] on 24 December 1166</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Handbook37&gt;Fryde, Greenway, Porter and Roy, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—[[Anjou]], [[Normandy]] and [[England]]—and expanded his empire by conquering [[Brittany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WarrenP21&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] and had a tenuous claim to [[History of Toulouse#12th century|Toulouse]] and [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of [[Louis VII of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WarrenP21/&gt; The result was the [[Angevin Empire]], named after Henry's paternal title as [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]] and, more specifically, its seat in [[Angers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn|The term [[Angevin Empire]] originates with Victorian historian [[Kate Norgate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Norgate (1887), p</span>
				<span class='text'>69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75; Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the custom of [[primogeniture]], under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>05&quot;&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>05</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the [[House of Capet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry had often allied himself with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>81</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Shortly after his birth, John was passed from Eleanor into the care of a [[wet nurse]], a traditional practice for medieval noble families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP31&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor then left for [[Poitiers]], the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] north to [[Fontevrault Abbey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&quot;&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP31/&gt; Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP31/&gt; John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a ''magister'' whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulph Glanville, a leading English administrator</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1; Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John spent some time as a member of the household of his eldest living brother [[Henry the Young King]], where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&quot;/&gt;John grew up to be around 5&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in (1</span>
				<span class='text'>8&amp;nbsp;m) tall, relatively short, with a &quot;powerful, barrel-chested body&quot; and dark red hair; he looked to contemporaries like an inhabitant of [[Poitou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McLynn, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7, 77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John enjoyed reading and, unusually for the period, built up a travelling library of books</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed gambling, in particular at [[backgammon]], and was an enthusiastic hunter, even by medieval standards</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As John grew up, he became known for sometimes being &quot;genial, witty, generous and hospitable&quot;; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, &quot;biting and gnawing his fingers&quot; in anger</span>

				<span class='text'>Henry the Young King had been crowned King of England in 1170, but was not given any formal powers by his father; he was also promised Normandy and Anjou as part of his future inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Richard I of England|Richard]] was to be appointed the Count of Poitou with control of Aquitaine, whilst [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] was to become the Duke of Brittany</span>

				<span class='text'>23; Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At this time it seemed unlikely that John would ever inherit substantial lands, and he was jokingly nicknamed &quot;Lackland&quot; by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McLynn, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of [[Humbert III of Savoy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of [[Savoy]], [[Piedmont]], [[Maurienne]], and the other possessions of Count Humbert</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt; For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of [[Château de Chinon|Chinon]], [[Loudun]] and [[Mirebeau]] into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt; Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt; Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt;In 1173 John's elder brothers, backed by Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the short-lived [[Revolt of 1173–1174|rebellion of 1173 to 1174]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense,&lt;ref name=CarpenterP223TurnerP35/&gt; Henry the Young King travelled to [[Paris]] and allied himself with [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CarpenterP223&gt;Carpenter (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join their brother Henry in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CarpenterP223/&gt; Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at [[Montlouis-sur-Loire|Montlouis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt; Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights, Richard was given Aquitaine back, and Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany; only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;John had spent the conflict travelling alongside his father, and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire as part of the Montlouis settlement; from then onwards, most observers regarded John as Henry II's favourite child, although he was the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt; Henry II began to find more lands for John, mostly at various nobles' expense</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1175 he appropriated the estates of the late [[Reginald de Dunstanville, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Earl of Cornwall]] and gave them to John</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP36/&gt; The following year, Henry disinherited the sisters of [[Isabel, Countess of Gloucester|Isabelle of Gloucester]], contrary to legal custom, and betrothed John to the now extremely wealthy Isabelle</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1177, at the Council of Oxford, Henry dismissed [[William FitzAldelm]] as the [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]] and replaced him with the ten-year-old John</span>

				<span class='text'>49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of &quot;[[Divine right of kings|divine majesty]]&quot;; John continued this trend and claimed an &quot;almost imperial status&quot; for himself as ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP149/&gt; During the 12th century, there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship, and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, and take counsel of the leading members of the realm</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP149/&gt; Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of &quot;royal schizophrenia&quot; in his approach to government, or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household: the [[Chancery (medieval office)#In England|Chancery]] kept written records and communications; the Treasury and the [[Exchequer]] dealt with income and expenditure respectively; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Huscroft, p</span>
				<span class='text'>84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating a new class of borough coroners</span>

				<span class='text'>A [[silver]] King John [[penny]], amongst the first to be struck in [[Dublin]]]]{{Main|Economy of England in the Middle Ages}}One of John's principal challenges was acquiring the large sums of money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or ''[[demesne]]''; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation</span>
				<span class='text'>Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the [[scutage]] system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king</span>
				<span class='text'>He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of [[charter]]s and other privileges</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lawler and Lawler, p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as &quot;avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McLynn, p</span>
				<span class='text'>88</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown</span>

				<span class='text'>48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the start of John's reign there was a [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages#Development of estate management|sudden change in prices]], as bad harvests and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Danziger and Gillingham, p</span>

				<span class='text'>2–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|King John presenting a church, painted c</span>
				<span class='text'>250-59 by [[Matthew Paris]] in his ''Historia Anglorum'']]John's royal household was based around several groups of followers</span>
				<span class='text'>One group was the ''familiares regis'', John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with him</span>
				<span class='text'>They also played an important role in organising and leading military campaigns</span>

				<span class='text'>44–5; Church (1999), p</span>
				<span class='text'>33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another section of royal followers were the ''[[curia regis]]''; these ''curiales'' were the senior officials and agents of the king and were essential to his day-to-day rule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, file lawsuits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Henry II, these posts were increasingly being filled by &quot;new men&quot; from outside the normal ranks of the barons</span>
				<span class='text'>This intensified under John's rule, with many lesser nobles arriving from the continent to take up positions at court; many were mercenary leaders from Poitou</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many barons perceived the king's household as what Ralph Turner has characterised as a &quot;narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons' expense&quot; staffed by men of lesser status</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP145/&gt;This trend for the king to rely on his own men at the expense of the barons was exacerbated by the tradition of Angevin royal ''ira et malevolentia'' – &quot;anger and ill-will&quot; – and John's own personality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Huscroft, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From Henry II onwards, ''ira et malevolentia'' had come to describe the right of the king to express his anger and displeasure at particular barons or clergy, building on the Norman concept of ''malevoncia'' – royal ill-will</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the Norman period, suffering the king's ill-will meant difficulties in obtaining grants, honours or petitions; Henry II had infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards [[Thomas Becket]]; this ultimately resulted in Becket's death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=HuscroftP170MasonP128/&gt; John now had the additional ability to &quot;cripple his vassals&quot; on a significant scale using his new economic and judicial measures, which made the threat of royal anger all the more serious</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour</span>

				<span class='text'>8&quot;/&gt; Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John's personal interest in the life of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|St Wulfstan of Worcester]] and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with [[Hugh of Lincoln]], who was later declared a saint</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerPP106-7/&gt; John's preferred plan was to use Poitou as a base of operations, advance up the [[Loire Valley|Loire valley]] to threaten Paris, pin down the French forces and break Philip's internal lines of communication before landing a maritime force in the Duchy itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerPP106-7/&gt; Ideally, this plan would benefit from the opening of a second front on Philip's eastern frontiers with Flanders and Boulogne – effectively a re-creation of Richard's old strategy of applying pressure from Germany</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP106/&gt; As an emergency measure, John recreated a version of Henry II's [[Assize of Arms of 1181]], with each [[shire]] creating a structure to mobilise local levies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP106/&gt; When the threat of invasion faded, John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou, and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP107/&gt; To achieve this, John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns, creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised, but would be financially supported by the other nine; knights would serve for an indefinite period</span>

				<span class='text'>The French victory at the [[battle of Bouvines]] doomed John's plan to retake Normandy in 1214 and led to the [[First Barons' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]===Tensions and discontent===Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerPP173-4&gt;Turner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>73–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as &quot;the Northerners&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France, and many of them owed large sums of money to John; the revolt has been characterised as &quot;a rebellion of the king's debtors&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>73, after Holt (1961)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Church (1999), p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>84–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For some the appointment of [[Peter des Roches]] as [[justiciar]] was an important factor, as he was considered an &quot;abrasive foreigner&quot; by many of the barons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; [[J</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Failure of the 1214 French campaign===In 1214 John began his final campaign to reclaim Normandy from Philip</span>
				<span class='text'>John was optimistic, as he had successfully built up alliances with the Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders; he was enjoying papal favour; and he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CarpenterP286&gt;Carpenter (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], marched south-west from Flanders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CarpenterP286/&gt;The first part of the campaign went well, with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]] and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>86; Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John besieged the castle of [[Roche-au-Moine]], a key stronghold, forcing Louis to give battle against John's larger army</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WarrenP222&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to [[La Rochelle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WarrenP222/&gt; Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought [[battle of Bouvines]] in the east against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=WarrenP224&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years</span>

				<span class='text'>An original version of ''[[Magna Carta]]'', agreed by John and the barons in 1215]]Within a few months of John's return, rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>74</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP178&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support</span>
				<span class='text'>This was particularly important for John, as a way of pressuring the barons but also as a way of controlling Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the king was escalating the conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP178/&gt; John announced his intent to become a [[crusades|crusader]], a move which gave him additional political protection under church law</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, p</span>
				<span class='text'>33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Letters of support from the pope arrived in April but by then the rebel barons had organised</span>
				<span class='text'>They congregated at [[Northampton]] in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, appointing [[Robert fitz Walter]] as their military leader</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>74, p</span>
				<span class='text'>79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This self-proclaimed &quot;Army of God&quot; marched on [[London]], taking the capital as well as [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Exeter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP180&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from John's royalist faction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP180/&gt; John instructed Langton to organise peace talks with the rebel barons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP180/&gt;John met the rebel leaders at [[Runnymede]], near [[Windsor Castle]], on 15 June 1215</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP180/&gt; Langton's efforts at mediation created a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; it was later renamed ''[[Magna Carta]]'', or &quot;Great Charter&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>80, 182</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The charter went beyond simply addressing specific baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform, albeit one focusing on the rights of free men, not serfs and [[unfree labour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>82</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on [[scutage]] and other feudal payments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;184–5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A council of twenty-five barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter, whilst the rebel army would stand down and London would be surrendered to the king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP189&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Neither John nor the rebel barons seriously attempted to implement the peace accord</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP189/&gt; The rebel barons suspected that the proposed baronial council would be unacceptable to John and that he would challenge the legality of the charter; they packed the baronial council with their own hardliners and refused to demobilise their forces or surrender London as agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>89–190</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite his promises to the contrary, John appealed to Innocent for help, observing that the charter compromised the pope's rights under the 1213 agreement that had appointed him John's feudal lord</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP190&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Innocent obliged; he declared the charter &quot;not only shameful and demeaning, but illegal and unjust&quot; and excommunicated the rebel barons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP190/&gt; The failure of the agreement led rapidly to the [[First Barons' War]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP192&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John was well prepared for a conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>He had stockpiled money to pay for mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful [[marcher lords]] with their own feudal forces, such as William Marshal and [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf of Chester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>91; Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London, protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders, prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP192/&gt; John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>86–7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;John's campaign started well</span>
				<span class='text'>In November John retook Rochester Castle from rebel baron [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]] in a sophisticated assault</span>
				<span class='text'>One chronicler had not seen &quot;a siege so hard pressed or so strongly resisted&quot;, whilst historian Reginald Brown describes it as &quot;one of the greatest [siege] operations in England up to that time&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>0–11; Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Having regained the south-east John split his forces, sending William Longespée to retake the north side of London and East Anglia, whilst John himself headed north via [[Nottingham]] to attack the estates of the northern barons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP193&gt;Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both operations were successful and the majority of the remaining rebels were pinned down in London</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP193/&gt; In January 1216 John marched against Alexander II of Scotland, who had allied himself with the rebel cause</span>

				<span class='text'>67</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=DuncanP267/&gt;The rebel barons responded by inviting the French prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]] to lead them: Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to [[Blanche of Castile]], a granddaughter of Henry II</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerPP191-2&gt;Turner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>91–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerPP191-2/&gt; Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DuncanP267&quot;/&gt;Prince Louis intended to land in the south of England in May 1216, and John assembled a naval force to intercept him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP193/&gt; Unfortunately for John, his fleet was dispersed by bad storms and Louis landed unopposed in [[Kent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=TurnerP193/&gt; John hesitated and decided not to attack Louis immediately, either due to the risks of open battle or over concerns about the loyalty of his own men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TurnerP193&quot;/&gt; Louis and the rebel barons advanced west and John retreated, spending the summer reorganising his defences across the rest of the kingdom</span>

				<span class='text'>94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; John saw several of his military household desert to the rebels, including his half-brother, William Longespée</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Tudor period|Tudor]] historians were generally favourably inclined towards the king, focusing on John's opposition to the Papacy and his promotion of the special rights and prerogatives of a king</span>
				<span class='text'>Revisionist histories written by [[John Foxe]], [[William Tyndale]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] portrayed John as an early Protestant hero, and [[John Foxe]] included the king in his ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bevington, p</span>
				<span class='text'>32&quot;&gt;Bevington, p</span>
				<span class='text'>32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[John Speed]]'s ''Historie of Great Britaine'' in 1632 praised John's &quot;great renown&quot; as a king; he blamed the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gillingham (2007), p</span>

				<span class='text'>[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'', officially titled ''Acts and Monuments'', which took a positive view of John's reign]]By the Victorian period in the 19th century historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Kate Norgate]], for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his &quot;almost superhuman wickedness&quot;, whilst James Ramsay blamed John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Norgate (1902), p</span>
				<span class='text'>86; Ramsay, p</span>
				<span class='text'>02</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Historians in the &quot;[[Whig history|Whiggish]]&quot; tradition, focusing on documents such as the [[Domesday Book]] and ''[[Magna Carta]]'', trace a progressive and [[Universalism|universalist]] course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=DyerP4CossP81&gt;Dyer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>; Coss, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of ''Magna Carta'' in particular, as a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=DyerP4CossP81/&gt; [[Winston Churchill]], for example, argued that &quot;[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as [[pipe roll]]s, charters, court documents and similar primary records</span>
				<span class='text'>Notably, an essay by [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|Vivian Galbraith]] in 1945 proposed a &quot;new approach&quot; to understanding the ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>28–30, cited Gillingham (2007), p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warren, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Interpretations of ''Magna Carta'' and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between &quot;partisan&quot; factions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Huscroft, p</span>
				<span class='text'>74; Barlow, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There has been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies</span>
				<span class='text'>Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by [[W</span>
				<span class='text'>L</span>
				<span class='text'>Warren|Lewis Warren]], suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Duffy, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>21, 245</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Most historians today, including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bradbury 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53&quot;/&gt; [[Jim Bradbury]] notes the current consensus that John was a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;, albeit, as Turner suggests, with &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bradbury (2007), p</span>
				<span class='text'>53; Turner, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gillingham]], author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him &quot;one of the worst kings ever to rule England&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gillingham (2001), p</span>
				<span class='text'>25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bradbury (2007), p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Popular historian [[Frank McLynn]] maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is &quot;bizarre&quot;, and that as a monarch John &quot;fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McLynn, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>72–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Popular representations==={{See also|Cultural depictions of John of England}}[[Image:FirstFolioKingJohn</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the first page of Shakespeare's play &quot;King John&quot;, with two columns of text below</span>
				<span class='text'>Shakespeare's play ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'']]Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bevington, p</span>
				<span class='text'>32&quot;/&gt; The anonymous play ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'' portrayed the king as a &quot;proto-Protestant martyr&quot;, similar to that shown in [[John Bale]]'s morality play ''[[John Bale#Kynge Johan|Kynge Johan]]'', in which John attempts to save England from the &quot;evil agents of the Roman Church&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Curren-Aquino (1989a), p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'> Harris, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on ''The Troublesome Reign'' for its source material, offers a more &quot;balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Curren-Aquino (1989a), p</span>
				<span class='text'>9; McEachern, p</span>
				<span class='text'>29; Bevington, p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Munday]]'s play ''[[The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington]]'' portrays many of John's negative traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Potter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 17th century, plays such as [[Robert Davenport]]'s ''[[King John and Matilda]]'', although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maley, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Nineteenth-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s historical romance, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', which presented &quot;an almost totally unfavourable picture&quot; of the king; the work drew on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare's play</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, p</span>
				<span class='text'>97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer [[Howard Pyle]]'s book ''[[The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional [[Robin Hood]] narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;D'Ammassa, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Sam De Grasse]]'s role as John in the black-and-white [[Robin Hood (1922 film)|1922 film version]] shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aberth, p</span>
				<span class='text'>66</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Rains]] played John in the [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|1938 colour version]] alongside [[Errol Flynn]], starting a trend for films to depict John as an &quot;effeminate&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=PotterP210&gt;Potter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], who is usually the &quot;swashbuckling villain&quot; opposing Robin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=PotterP210/&gt; An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Disney cartoon version]], for example, which depicts John, voiced by [[Peter Ustinov]], as a &quot;cowardly, thumbsucking lion&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Potter, p</span>
				<span class='text'>18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as [[James Goldman]]'s play and later film, ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'', set in 1183, commonly present him as an &quot;effete weakling&quot;, in this instance contrasted with the more masculine [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]</span>
