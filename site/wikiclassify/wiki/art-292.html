				<span class='text'>When Monroe and the British signed a renewal in December 1806, Jefferson decided not to even submit it to the Senate for ratification</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the new treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would have been good for business, Jefferson refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain and was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of [[impressment]] of American sailors</span>
				<span class='text'>Jefferson did not attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the [[War of 1812]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=December 2011}}Monroe informed Congress in March 1822 that permanent stable governments had been established in the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] (the core of present-day [[Argentina]]), [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Adams, under Monroe's supervision, wrote the instructions for the ministers (ambassadors) to these new countries</span>

				<span class='text'>Britain, with its powerful navy, also opposed re-conquest of [[Latin America]] and suggested that the United States join in proclaiming a &quot;hands off&quot; policy</span>
