				<span class='text'>Aaron grew up in a poor family --&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt;  His family couldn't afford baseball equipment, so he practiced by hitting bottle caps with sticks</span>
				<span class='text'>He would create his own bats and balls out of materials he found on the streets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemec|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron attended Central High School as a [[Ninth grade|freshman]] and a [[Tenth grade|sophomore]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Like most all-black high schools they did not have organized baseball, and so he played [[outfield]] and [[third base]] for the [[Mobile Black Bears]], a semipro team</span>

				<span class='text'>lthough he batted cross-handed (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> as a right-handed hitter, with his left hand above his right), Aaron established himself as a power hitter</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, in 1949, at the age of fifteen, Aaron had his first tryout with an MLB franchise, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers#Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]; however, he did not make the team</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=angelfire&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=br33/&gt; After this, Aaron returned to school to finish his secondary education, attending the Josephine Allen Institute, a private high school in Alabama</span>
				<span class='text'>During his [[Eleventh grade|junior year]], Aaron first joined the [[Pritchett Athletics]],&lt;ref name=br33&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Mobile Black Bears]], an independent [[Negro league baseball|Negro league]] team</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; While on the Bears, Aaron earned $3 per game (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10|1951|r=0}}}} today), which was a dollar more than he got while on the Athletics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=br33/&gt;Aaron's minor league career began on November 20, 1951, when baseball scout [[Ed Scott (baseball scout)|Ed Scott]] signed Aaron to a contract on behalf of the [[Indianapolis Clowns]] of the [[Negro American League]] where he played three months</span>

				<span class='text'>Years later, Aaron remembered:: &quot;I had the Giants' contract in my hand</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Braves offered fifty dollars a month more</span>
				<span class='text'>That's the only thing that kept [[Willie Mays]] and me from being teammates&amp;nbsp;– fifty dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honig|2000|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;While with the Clowns he experienced some overt racism</span>

				<span class='text'>: &quot;We had breakfast while we were waiting for the rain to stop, and I can still envision sitting with the Clowns in a restaurant behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating</span>
				<span class='text'>What a horrible sound</span>
				<span class='text'>Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: here we were in the capital in the land of freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had been in the mouths of black men</span>
				<span class='text'>If dogs had eaten off those plates, they'd have washed them</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CB/&gt; On June 12, 1952, Aaron signed with Braves' scout Dewey Griggs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CB/&gt;  During this time, he picked up the nickname '[[pork chops]]' because it &quot;was the only thing I knew to order off the menu</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teammate later said, &quot;the man ate pork chops three meals a day, two for breakfast</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollock|2006|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Braves assigned Aaron to the [[Eau Claire Bears]], the Braves' [[Northern League (baseball, 1902–71)|Northern League]] [[Minor League Baseball#Class B, C and D|Class-C]] [[Farm system#Baseball|farm team]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; The 1952 season proved to be very beneficial for Aaron</span>
				<span class='text'>Playing in the [[infield]], Aaron continued to develop as a ballplayer and made the Northern League's All-Star team</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; He broke his habit of hitting cross-handed and adopted the standard hitting technique</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of the season, he had performed so well that the league made him the unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year</span>

				<span class='text'>36 batting average</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; During his minor league experience, he was very homesick and faced constant racism, but his brother, Herbert Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> told him not to give up the opportunity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|2002|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1953, the Braves promoted him to the [[Jacksonville Braves]], their Class-A affiliate in the [[South Atlantic League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; Helped by Aaron's performance, the Braves won the league championship that year</span>
				<span class='text'>Aaron led the league in runs (115), hits (208), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (36), RBI (125), total bases (338), and batting average (</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;/&gt; Aaron's time with the Braves did not come without problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the first [[African American]]s to play in the league</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s were a period of [[racial segregation]] in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>When Aaron traveled around [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the surrounding areas, he was often separated from his team because of [[Jim Crow laws]]</span>
