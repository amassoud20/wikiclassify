				<span class='text'>]In October 1945, John Bardeen began work at [[Bell Labs]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bardeen was a member of a Solid State Physics Group, led by [[William Shockley]] and chemist Stanley Morgan</span>
				<span class='text'>Other personnel working in the group were [[Walter Brattain]], physicist [[Gerald Pearson]], chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore and several technicians</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]]</span>

				<span class='text'>117</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Soon, however, life in Summit would become easy and rich for the Bardeens</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;The assignment of the group was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers</span>
				<span class='text'> Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity</span>
				<span class='text'>These experiments mysteriously failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor</span>
				<span class='text'>The group changed its focus to study these surface states, and they met almost daily to discuss the work</span>
				<span class='text'> The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brattain quoted in ''Crystal Fire'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>127&lt;/ref&gt; By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to ''[[Physical Review]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments</span>
				<span class='text'> The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with [[electrolyte]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily and suggested that they use glycol borate (gu), a viscous chemical that didn't evaporate</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley,&lt;ref&gt;''Crystal Fire'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>132&lt;/ref&gt; put a voltage on a droplet of gu placed across a [[P-N junction]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team</span>
				<span class='text'>Shockley eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor</span>
				<span class='text'>Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group</span>
