				<span class='text'>or Štefan Veľký}}; {{circa}} 975 – 15 August 1038 AD), was the last [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first [[King of Hungary]] from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038</span>
				<span class='text'>The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in [[Esztergom]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At his birth, he was given the pagan name '''Vajk'''</span>
				<span class='text'>The date of his baptism is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the only son of Grand Prince [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] and his wife, [[Sarolt]], who was descended from the prominent family of the ''[[Gyula (title)|gyulas]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of [[Árpáds|his family]] to become a devout Christian</span>
				<span class='text'>He married [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela of Bavaria]], a scion of the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, [[Koppány]], who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors</span>
				<span class='text'>He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of foreign knights, including [[Vecelin]], [[Hont-Pázmány#Notable members of the clan|Hont and Pázmány]], but also with help from native lords</span>
				<span class='text'>He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by [[Pope Sylvester II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftains{{mdash}}including the [[Black Hungarians]] and his uncle, [[Gyula III|Gyula the Younger]]{{mdash}}he unified the [[Carpathian Basin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], to withdraw from Hungary in 1030</span>
				<span class='text'>tephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs</span>
				<span class='text'>His system of local administration was based on [[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] organized around fortresses and administered by [[Ispán|royal officials]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for [[pilgrims]] and merchants traveling between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Holy Land]] or [[Constantinople]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e survived all of his children</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in [[Székesfehérvár Basilica|his new basilica]], built in [[Székesfehérvár]] and dedicated to the [[Holy Virgin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His death caused civil wars which lasted for decades</span>
				<span class='text'>He was [[canonized]], together with his son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]], and Bishop [[Gerardo Sagredo|Gerard of Csanád]], in 1083</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hungary, his [[feast day]] (celebrated on 20 August) is also a [[Public holidays in Hungary|public holiday]] commemorating the foundation of the state</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=64}} Géza promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=44}} In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the ''[[Polish-Hungarian Chronicle]]'' and later [[Poles|Polish]] sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland]], but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop [[Adalbert of Prague]],{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} who stayed in Géza's court several times between 983 and 994</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=16}} However, Saint Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous ''Legend'', written by [[Bruno of Querfurt]], does not mention this event</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=16}}Stephen's official hagiography, written by Bishop [[Hartvik|Hartvic]] and sanctioned by [[Pope Innocent III]], narrates that he &quot;was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art&quot; in his childhood</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he &quot;was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} Kristó says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=15}} According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from [[Kingdom of Italy (imperial)|Italy]], who later founded a monastery in [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Györffy|1983|p=132}}According to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince Géza convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen &quot;ascended to the first stage of adolescence&quot;,&lt;ref name=Hartvic/&gt; at the age of 14 or 15</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Györffy|1994|pp=79–80}}{{sfn|Kristó|2001|p=17}} Géza nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Györffy|1994|p=78}} Slovak historians, including [[Ján Steinhübel]] and Ján Lukačka, accept Györffy's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now [[Nitra]], Slovakia) from around 995</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Steinhübel|2011|p=19}}{{sfn|Lukačka|2011|p=31}}Géza arranged Stephen's marriage, to [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], daughter of [[Henry the Wrangler]], [[Duke of Bavaria]], in or after 995</span>
