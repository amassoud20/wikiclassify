				<span class='text'>Churchill'', arguing that the return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity in 1925 (£1=$4</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the decision was generally popular and seen as 'sound economics' although it was opposed by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and the Federation of British Industries</span>

				<span class='text'>The most affected was the coal industry, already suffering from declining output as shipping switched to oil</span>

				<span class='text'>Baldwin's position was strengthened when Duff Cooper won, and when the civil disobedience campaign in India ceased with the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The second issue was a claim by Churchill that Sir [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] and [[Edward George Villiers Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] had pressured the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to change evidence it had given to the Joint Select Committee considering the Government of India Bill, and in doing so had breached Parliamentary privilege</span>

				<span class='text'>258&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of controversy about Churchill's attitude towards Indian affairs arises over what some historians term the Indian 'nationalist approach' to the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], which has sought to place significant blame on Churchill's wartime government for the excessive mortality of up to four million people</span>

				<span class='text'>Formulated in this way, Churchill's mental health history contains unmistakable echoes of the seminal interpretation of Lord Moran's Black Dog revelations made by Dr [[Anthony Storr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A</span>
				<span class='text'>Storr, 'The Man', in A</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Taylor et al</span>
				<span class='text'> Churchill: Four Faces and the Man (Penguin, 1973)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In drawing so heavily on Moran for what he took to be the latter's totally reliable, first-hand clinical evidence of Churchill's lifelong struggle with &quot;prolonged and recurrent depression&quot; and its associated &quot;despair&quot;, Storr produced a seemingly authoritative and persuasive diagnostic essay that, in the words of John Ramsden, &quot;strongly influenced all later accounts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;J</span>
				<span class='text'>Ramsden, Man of the Century: Winston Churchill and his Legend since 1945 (Harper Collins, 2003), p</span>
				<span class='text'>531&lt;/ref&gt;However, Storr was not aware that, as Moran's biographer Professor Richard Lovell has shown, Moran, contrary to the impression created in his book, kept no diary, in the dictionary sense of the word, during his years as Churchill's doctor</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor was Storr aware that Moran's book as published was a much rewritten account which mixed together Moran's contemporaneous jottings with later material acquired from other sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;R</span>
				<span class='text'>Lovell, Churchill's Doctor (Royal Society of Medicine Services, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; As Wilfred Attenborough has demonstrated, the key Black Dog 'diary' entry for 14 August 1944 was an arbitrarily dated pastiche in which the explicit reference to Black Dog—the first of the few in the book (with an associated footnote definition of the term)—was taken, not from anything Churchill had said to Moran, but from much later claims made to Moran by Brendan Bracken (a non-clinician, of course) in 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>Attenborough, Churchill and the 'Black Dog' of Depression (Palgrave, 2014), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>187–97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although seemingly unnoticed by Dr Storr and those he influenced, Moran later on in his book retracts his earlier suggestion, also derived from Brendan Bracken, that, towards the end of the Second World War, Churchill was succumbing to &quot;the inborn melancholia of the Churchill blood&quot;; also unnoticed by Storr et al</span>
				<span class='text'> Moran, in his final chapter, states that Churchill, before the start of the First World War, &quot;had managed to extirpate bouts of depression from his system&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lord Moran, Struggle for Survival, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>307, 309–10, 785–86, 786–88</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Despite the difficulties with Moran's book, the many illustrations it provides of a Churchill understandably plunged into temporary low mood by military defeats and other severely adverse developments constitute a compelling portrait of a great man reacting to, but not significantly impeded by, worry and overstrain, a compelling portrait that is entirely consistent with the portraits of others who worked closely with Churchill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sir John Wheeler-Bennett (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Action This Day (Macmillan, 1968); J</span>

				<span class='text'>and Abel, E</span>
				<span class='text'> Special Envoy to Churchill and Stalin 1941–1946 (Hutchinson, 1976)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it can be readily deduced from Moran's book that Churchill did not receive medication for depression – the amphetamine that Moran prescribed for special occasions, especially for big speeches from the autumn of 1953 onwards, was to combat the effects of Churchill's stroke of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>Attenborough, Churchill and the 'Black Dog' of Depression (Palgrave, 2014), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>153–58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Churchill himself seems, in a long life, to have written about Black Dog on one occasion only: the reference, a backward-looking one, occurs in a private handwritten letter to Clementine Churchill dated July 1911 which reports the successful treatment of a relative's depression by a doctor in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mary Soames (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Speaking For Themselves: the Personal Letters of Winston and Clementine Churchill (Black Swan, 1999), p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His ministerial circumstances at that date, the very limited treatments available for serious depression pre-1911, the fact of the relative's being &quot;complete cured&quot;, and, not least, the evident deep interest Churchill took in the fact of the complete cure, can be shown to point to Churchill's pre-1911 Black Dog depression's having been a form of mild (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>non-psychotic) anxiety-depression,&lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>Attenborough, Churchill and the 'Black Dog' of Depression (Palgrave, 2014), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>72–81</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; as that term is defined by Professor Edward Shorter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Shorter, How Everyone Became Depressed (OUP, New York 2013), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>118–24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It will be apparent from the preceding paragraphs that there is a serious doubt about the reliability of the evidential foundations of the dominant, essentially Storrian, perception that Churchill's mental health was an open-and-shut case of clinical depression</span>
				<span class='text'>Moran himself leaned strongly in the direction of his patient's being &quot;by nature very apprehensive&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Moran, Struggle for Survival (Constable, 1966), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>99–100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; close associates of Churchill have disputed the idea that apprehension was a defining feature of Churchill's temperament, although they readily concede that he was noticeably worried and anxious about some matters, especially in the buildup to important speeches in the House of Commons and elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;J</span>
				<span class='text'>Wheeler-Bennett (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Action This Day (Macmillan, 1968), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>70, 146</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; And Churchill himself all but openly acknowledged in his book 'Painting as a Pastime' that he was prey to the &quot;worry and mental overstrain [experienced] by persons who, over prolonged periods, have to bear exceptional responsibilities and discharge duties upon a very large scale&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill, Painting as a Pastime (Odhams, 1948), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7–13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he found a remedy in painting and bricklaying is a strong indicator that the condition as he defined it did not amount to 'clinical depression', certainly not as that term was understood during the lifetimes of himself and Lord Moran</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;D</span>
				<span class='text'>Stafford-Clark, Psychiatry Today (Penguin, 1952), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>94–99</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Lord Moran, during the war years Churchill sought solace in his tumbler of whisky and soda and his cigar</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill was also a very emotional man, unafraid to shed tears when appropriate</span>
				<span class='text'>During some of his broadcast speeches it was noticed that he was trying to hold back the tears</span>

				<span class='text'>Because of the cultural importance of the city, and of the number of [[civilian casualties]] close to the end of the war, this remains one of the most controversial Western Allied actions of the war</span>

				<span class='text'>As historian and journalist [[Max Hastings]] wrote in an article subtitled &quot;the Allied Bombing of Dresden&quot;: &quot;I believe it is wrong to describe strategic bombing as a war crime, for this might be held to suggest some moral equivalence with the deeds of the Nazis</span>

				<span class='text'>===European Unity====In the summer of 1930, inspired by the ideas being floated by [[Aristide Briand]] and by his recent tour of the US in the autumn of 1929, Churchill wrote an article lamenting the instability which had been caused by the independence of Poland and the disintegration of Austria-Hungary into petty states, and called for a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, although he wrote that Britain was &quot;with Europe but not of it&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James 1970, p</span>
				<span class='text'>220&lt;/ref&gt;Ideas about closer European union continued to circulate, driven by [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], from 1942 onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charmley 1995, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>107–830&lt;/ref&gt; As early as March 1943 a Churchill speech on postwar reconstruction annoyed the US administration not only by not mentioning China as a great power but by proposing a purely European &quot;Council of Europe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Harry Hopkins]] passed on President Roosevelt's concerns, warning Eden that it would &quot;give free ammunition to (US) isolationists&quot; who might propose an American &quot;regional council&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill urged Eden, on a visit to the US at the time, to &quot;listen politely&quot; but give &quot;no countenance&quot; to Roosevelt's proposals for the US, UK, USSR and [[Chiang Kai-Shek]]'s China to act together to enforce &quot;Global Collective Security&quot; with the Japanese and French Empires taken into international trusteeship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charmley 1995, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>65–66&lt;/ref&gt;Now out of office, Churchill gave a speech at Zurich on 19 September 1946 in which he called for &quot;a kind of United States of Europe&quot; centred around a Franco-German partnership, with Britain and the Commonwealth, and perhaps the US, as &quot;friends and sponsors of the new Europe&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>''&quot;[[The Times]]&quot;'' wrote of him &quot;startling the world&quot; with &quot;outrageous propositions&quot; and warned that there was as yet little appetite for such unity, and that he appeared to be assuming a permanent division between Eastern and Western Europe, and urged &quot;more humdrum&quot; economic agreements</span>
				<span class='text'>The speech was praised by [[Leo Amery]] and by [[Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi|Count Coudenhove-Kalergi]] who wrote that it would galvanise governments into action</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Seldon 1981, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>Churchill affected to believe that the proposed EDC would not work, scoffing at the supposed difficulties of language</span>
				<span class='text'>Churchill asked in vain for a US military commitment to support Britain's position in Egypt and Middle East (where the Truman Administration had recently pressured Attlee not to intervene against [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mossadeq]] in Iran); this did not meet with American approval – the US expected British support to fight communism in [[Korean War|Korea]], but saw any US commitment to the Middle East as supporting British imperialism, and were unpersuaded that this would help prevent pro-Soviet regimes from coming to power</span>

				<span class='text'>In October 1954, Britain and Egypt would conclude an agreement on the phased evacuation of British troops from the Suez base, to the dismay—privately shared by Churchill—of the &quot;Suez Group&quot; of Conservative backbenchers</span>
