				<span class='text'>He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the [[Roman Republic]] and the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 60 BC, Caesar, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], and [[Pompey]] formed a [[First Triumvirate|political alliance]] that was to dominate [[Roman politics]] for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>Their attempts to amass power through [[populares|populist]] tactics were opposed by the [[Optimates|conservative ruling class]] within the [[Roman Senate]], among them [[Cato the Younger]] with the frequent support of [[Cicero]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar's victories in the [[Gallic Wars]], completed by 51&amp;nbsp;BC, extended Rome's territory to the [[English Channel]] and the [[Rhine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge across the Rhine]] and conducted the first [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasion of Britain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hese achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the [[Battle of Carrhae|death of Crassus]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49&amp;nbsp;BC by crossing the [[Rubicon]] with a [[Roman legion|legion]], leaving his province and illegally entering [[Roman Italy]] under arms</span>

				<span class='text'>fter assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the [[Julian calendar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed &quot;[[Roman Dictator|dictator]] in perpetuity&quot;, giving him additional authority</span>
				<span class='text'>But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the [[Ides of March]] (15&amp;nbsp;March) 44&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] by a group of rebellious senators led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A new series of [[Roman civil war|civil wars]] broke out, and the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|constitutional government of the Republic]] was never fully restored</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar's adopted heir Octavius, later known as [[Augustus]], rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>Octavius set about solidifying his power, and the era of the [[Roman Empire]] began</span>

				<span class='text'>The calendar was then regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had left it in a mess</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar, which was regulated by the sun</span>
				<span class='text'>He set the length of the year to 365</span>
				<span class='text'>5 days by adding an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary/leap day]] at the end of February every fourth year</span>

				<span class='text'>tml#40 40]&lt;/ref&gt;To bring the calendar into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46&amp;nbsp;BC (the ordinary intercalary month at the end of February, and two extra months after November)</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the [[Julian calendar]] opened on 1 January 45 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sue40&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; This calendar is almost identical to [[Gregorian calendar|the current Western calendar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly before his assassination, he passed a few more reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He established a police force, appointed officials to carry out his land reforms, and ordered the rebuilding of [[Carthage]] and [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also extended Latin rights throughout the Roman world, and then abolished the tax system and reverted to the earlier version that allowed cities to collect tribute however they wanted, rather than needing Roman intermediaries</span>
				<span class='text'>His assassination prevented further and larger schemes, which included the construction of an unprecedented temple to Mars, a huge theater, and a library on the scale of the [[Library of Alexandria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;He also wanted to convert [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] to a major port, and cut a canal through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Militarily, he wanted to conquer the [[Dacia]]ns and [[Parthia]]ns, and avenge the loss at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, he instituted a massive mobilization</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and Father of the Fatherland, and the month of [[Quintilis]] was renamed July in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;He was granted further honors, which were later used to justify his assassination as a would-be divine monarch: coins were issued bearing his image and his statue was placed next to those of the kings</span>
				<span class='text'>He was granted a golden chair in the Senate, was allowed to wear triumphal dress whenever he chose, and was offered a form of semiofficial or popular [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]], with Mark Antony as his [[Flamen Divi Iulii|high priest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;====Political reforms===={{Main|Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar}}The history of Caesar's political appointments is complex and uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar held both the [[Roman Dictator|dictatorship]] and the [[Tribune|tribunate]], but alternated between the [[Roman Consul|consulship]] and the [[proconsul]]ship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 134&quot; /&gt; His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 134&quot; /&gt; He was first appointed dictator in 49&amp;nbsp;BC, possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within 11 days</span>
				<span class='text'>In 48&amp;nbsp;BC, he was reappointed dictator, only this time for an indefinite period, and in 46&amp;nbsp;BC, he was appointed dictator for 10 years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot;&gt;Abbott, 136&lt;/ref&gt;In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot;&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt; which made his person sacrosanct and allowed him to veto the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt; although on at least one occasion, tribunes did attempt to obstruct him</span>
				<span class='text'>The offending tribunes in this case were brought before the Senate and divested of their office</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt; This was not the first time Caesar had violated a tribune's sacrosanctity</span>
				<span class='text'>After he had first marched on Rome in 49 BC, he forcibly opened the treasury, although a tribune had the seal placed on it</span>
				<span class='text'>After the impeachment of the two obstructive tribunes, Caesar, perhaps unsurprisingly, faced no further opposition from other members of the Tribunician College</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt;When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, the ranks of the Senate had been severely depleted, so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot; /&gt; All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 138&quot;&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt;In 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of &quot;Prefect of the Morals&quot;, which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical to those of the ''[[Roman censor|censors]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt; Thus, he could hold censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks to which the ordinary censors were subject, and he used these powers to fill the Senate with his own partisans</span>
				<span class='text'>He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the Senate to bestow various titles and honors upon him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was, for example, given the title of &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot; and &quot;''[[imperator]]''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt;Coins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during Senate meetings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; Caesar then increased the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot; /&gt;Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to link more tightly the other provinces of the empire into a single cohesive unit</span>
				<span class='text'>This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the [[Social War (91‚Äì88 BC)|Social War]] decades earlier, where individuals outside Rome and Italy were not considered &quot;Roman&quot;,  thus were not given full citizenship rights</span>
				<span class='text'>This process, of fusing the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus</span>
				<span class='text'>n February 44 BC, one month before his assassination, he was appointed dictator for life</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Caesar, a significant amount of authority was vested in his lieutenants,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; mostly because Caesar was frequently out of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; In October 45&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar resigned his position as sole consul, and facilitated the election of two successors for the remainder of the year, which theoretically restored the ordinary consulship, since the constitution did not recognize a single consul without a colleague</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot;&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:RSC 0004a</span>

				<span class='text'>Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC</span>
