				<span class='text'>quot; Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; and &quot;[[Root Beer Rag]]&quot;, an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s</span>

				<span class='text'>== Early 1980s ===The success of his piano-driven ballads like &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, &quot;She's Always a Woman&quot;, and &quot;Honesty&quot; led some critics to label Joel a &quot;[[ballad]]eer&quot; and &quot;[[soft rock]]er&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that &quot;people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;It's Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot; spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40</span>
				<span class='text'>'Glass Houses'' won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male</span>
				<span class='text'>It would also win the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category</span>
				<span class='text'>The album's closing song, &quot;Through The Long Night&quot; ([[B-side]] of the &quot;It's Still Rock &amp; Roll to Me&quot; single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[Yes It Is]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting</span>
				<span class='text'>Joel subsequently sued Weber for $90&amp;nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded $2&amp;nbsp;million in a partial judgement against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a $30&amp;nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber</span>

				<span class='text'>''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer</span>
				<span class='text'>For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single &quot;Just Wanna Hold&quot;; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him</span>
				<span class='text'>Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'Storm Front'''s second single, &quot;[[I Go to Extremes]]&quot; reached No</span>
				<span class='text'>6 in early 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>The album was also notable for its song &quot;[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]&quot;, written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and &quot;[[The Downeaster Alexa]]&quot;, written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet</span>
				<span class='text'>Another well-known single from the album is the ballad &quot;[[And So It Goes]]&quot; (#37 in late 1990)</span>
				<span class='text'>The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but &quot;And So It Goes&quot; did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''</span>
				<span class='text'>Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm</span>
				<span class='text'>n the summer of 1992, Joel filed another $90&amp;nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=http://www</span>
