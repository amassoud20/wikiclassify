				<span class='text'>In 1400, he was ordained as a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1402 Hus began preaching inside the city demanding for the reformation of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Prague in 1402–03</span>
				<span class='text'>He was appointed a preacher at the newly built Bethlehem Chapel around the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs, and therefore the [[Philosophical realism|Realists]], and he was influenced by the writings of [[John Wycliffe]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Although Church authorities banned many works of Wycliffe in 1403, Hus translated ''Trialogus'' into [[Czech language|Czech]] and helped to distribute it</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]Hus tried to reform the Church by  delineating the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit</span>
				<span class='text'>Archbishop [[Zbyněk Zajíc]] tolerated this, and even appointed Hus as preacher to the clergy's biennial synod</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 June 1405, [[Pope Innocent VII]], however, directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe's teachings, especially the doctrine of [[impanation]] in the [[Eucharist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The archbishop complied by issuing a [[synod]]al decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cath&quot;/&gt;In 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the [[University of Oxford]] and praising Wycliffe</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit</span>
				<span class='text'>Then in 1408, [[Pope Gregory XII]] warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe's heresies and of [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus]]'s sympathies for non-conformists</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, the king and University ordered all of Wycliffe's writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cath&quot;/&gt;===Papal Schism===At this time (1408), the [[Charles University in Prague]] was divided by the [[Western Schism]], in which Gregory XII in Rome and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] in [[Avignon]] both claimed the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism, and said that he expected the same of the University</span>
				<span class='text'>Archbishop Zajíc remained faithful to Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian &quot;nation&quot; (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The oldest known representation of Jan Hus is from Martinická bible]]====Kutná Hora Decree====At the urging of Hus and other Bohemian leaders, King Wenceslaus decreed (in [[Kutná Hora]]) that the &quot;Bohemian nation&quot; would have three votes (instead of one) in University affairs, while the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Poland|Polish]] &quot;nations&quot; would have only one vote in total</span>
				<span class='text'>As a consequence, between five thousand and twenty thousand foreign doctors, masters, and students left Prague in 1409</span>
				<span class='text'>This exodus resulted in the founding of the [[University of Leipzig]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Charles University lost its international importance and became a strictly Czech school</span>
				<span class='text'>The emigrants also spread news of the Bohemian &quot;heresies&quot; throughout the rest of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Archbishop Zajíc became isolated and Hus was at the height of his fame</span>
				<span class='text'>He became Rector of the University, and enjoyed the favor of the court</span>
				<span class='text'>Wycliffe's doctrines also regained favor in Prague</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}====Alexander V becomes Antipope====In 1409, the [[Council of Pisa]] tried to end the schism by electing [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit</span>
				<span class='text'>(Alexander was declared an &quot;[[antipope]]&quot; by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1418</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus, his followers, and Wenceslaus transferred their allegiance to Alexander V</span>
				<span class='text'>Under pressure from Wenceslaus, Archbishop Zajíc did the same</span>
				<span class='text'>Zajíc then lodged an accusation of &quot;ecclesiastical disturbances&quot; against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V</span>
				<span class='text'>===Excommunication====On 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a [[papal bull]] that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague</span>
				<span class='text'>All copies of Wycliffe's writings were to be surrendered and his doctrines repudiated, and free preaching discontinued</span>
				<span class='text'>After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by Alexander V</span>
				<span class='text'>===Indulgences====[[File:Stimmer Jan Hus</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Jan Hus engraving, 1587]]Archbishop Zajíc died in 1411, and with his death the [[Bohemian Reformation|religious movement in Bohemia]] entered a new phase, where the disputes concerning [[indulgences]] assumed great importance</span>
				<span class='text'>===Crusade against Naples====Alexander V died in 1410, and was succeeded by [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (also later declared an antipope)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1411,  John XXIII proclaimed a [[crusade]] against King [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the protector of rival [[Pope Gregory XII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This crusade was preached in Prague as well</span>
				<span class='text'>John XXIII also authorized the sale of [[indulgence]]s to raise money for the war, and priests selling indulgences urged people to crowd the churches and give their offerings</span>
				<span class='text'>This traffic in indulgences was to some a sign of the corruption of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|reason=The anti-church?|date=July 2012}}====Condemnation of indulgences and Crusade====Hus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address ''Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe's book, ''De ecclesia'', and his treatise, ''De absolutione a pena et culpa''</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus asserted that no Pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those that curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days afterward, some of Hus's followers, led by Vok Voksa z Valdštejna, burnt the [[Papal bull]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and [[Simony|Simonists]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}In response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded</span>
				<span class='text'>They were later considered the first martyrs of the [[Hussite]] Church</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus</span>
				<span class='text'>The king forbade the teaching of these articles, but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling, requesting that the articles should be first proven to be un-scriptural</span>
				<span class='text'>The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation; papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}====Attempts at reconciliation====Wenceslaus made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation  and, at their suggestion, ordered a [[synod]] to be held at [[Český Brod]] on 2 February 1412</span>
				<span class='text'>It did not take place there, but in the palace of the archbishops at Prague, in order to exclude Hus from participation</span>
				<span class='text'>Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom in regard to ecclesiastical affairs as other countries &lt;!-- what other countries?? --&gt; and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the doctrine of Wycliffe (''Sermones'', iii</span>
				<span class='text'>519, etc</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>here followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me,&quot; Hus wrote at the time, &quot;I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The synod did not produce any results, but the King ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctors of the university demanded approval of their conception of the Church, according to which the Pope is the head, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are the body of the Church, from Hus and his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus protested vigorously</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation</span>
				<span class='text'>To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only &quot;so far as every pious Christian is bound&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Hus leaves Prague and appeals to Jesus Christ ==== By this time, Hus's ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia, and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>The attack on Hus by the Pope and Archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia</span>
				<span class='text'>Wenceslaus and his government took the side of Hus, and the power of his adherents increased from day to day</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus continued to preach in the [[Bethlehem Chapel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The churches of the city were put under the ban, and the [[interdict]] was pronounced against [[Prague]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council</span>
				<span class='text'>On 18 October 1412 he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge</span>

				<span class='text'>fter Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation on one hand, and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care on the other</span>

				<span class='text'>Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted only of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote his work at the castle of one of his protectors in Kozí Hrádek, and sent it to Prague, where it was publicly read in the Bethlehem Chapel</span>
				<span class='text'>It was answered by ze Znojma and Páleč with treatises of the same title</span>

				<span class='text'>To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at [[Konstanz]] (Constance)</span>

				<span class='text'>In the beginning, Hus was at liberty, under his safe-conduct from Sigismund, and lived at the house of a widow</span>

				<span class='text'>The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and bound his neck with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck</span>
				<span class='text'>At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Count Palatine]], asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life</span>
				<span class='text'>Hus declined thus:{{quote|God is my witness that the things charged against me I never preached</span>

				<span class='text'>An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of [[:wikt:brushwood|brushwood]] on it</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, &quot;''Sancta Simplicitas!''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The phrase's [[Czech language|Czech]] equivalent, &quot;''Svatá prostota!''&quot; ([[Vocative case#Czech|vocative form]]: &quot;''Svatá prostoto!''&quot;, Translated &quot;''Holy simplicity!''&quot;) is still used today when commenting on a person's stupid action and naïveté</span>

				<span class='text'>if|thumb|Some two thousand of Hus' followers were thrown into the [[Kutná Hora]] mines by pro-Catholic townsmen]]Responding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings, provoking Rome to pronounce a [[crusade]] against them (1 March 1420): [[Pope Martin V]] issued a [[Papal bull]] authorising the killing of all supporters of reformers like Hus and Wycliffe</span>
				<span class='text'>he Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and became a major military power</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the leadership of [[Jan Žižka]] (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1360–1424) – and later of [[Prokop the Great]] (ca</span>
				<span class='text'>1380 – 1434), the Hussites defeated the crusade and the three crusades that followed (1419–1434)</span>
				<span class='text'>Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the [[Council of Basel]] in 1436</span>
				<span class='text'>A century later, as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the [[Czech Crown lands]] still followed Hussite teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>==Hus's scholarship and teachings===[[File:Luther und Hus-Abendmahl</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Luther und Hus serving [[Communion under both kinds]] together, picture from 16th-century Saxony demonstrating the affinity of Lutherans with Hussites]]Hus left only a few reformatory writings in the proper sense of the word, most of his works being polemical treatises against Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč</span>
				<span class='text'>He translated Wycliffe's ''Trialogus'', and was very familiar with his works on the body of the Lord, on the Church, on the power of the pope, and especially with his sermons</span>
				<span class='text'>There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe's doctrine of the Lord's Supper ([[consubstantiation]] rather than [[transubstantiation]]&lt;ref&gt;Gotthard Victor Lechler, [http://books</span>

				<span class='text'>381ff&lt;/ref&gt;) had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them</span>
				<span class='text'>It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it, although it is possible that he simply repeated it without advocating it</span>
				<span class='text'>But the doctrine was seized eagerly by the radical party, the [[Taborites]], who made it the central point of their system</span>
				<span class='text'>According to their book, the Church is not that hierarchy which is generally designated as Church; the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>Christ, not the pope, is its head</span>
				<span class='text'>It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities are a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church</span>
				<span class='text'>o some, Hus's efforts were predominantly designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses, rather than a campaign of sweeping theological change</span>
				<span class='text'>To others, the seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus's and Wycliffe's writings</span>
				<span class='text'>In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, &quot;One pays for confession, for mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers</span>
				<span class='text'>The very last penny which an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved</span>
				<span class='text'>The villainous priest will grab it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Macek, 16) After  Hus's death, his followers, then known as [[Hussite]]s, split off into several groups including the [[Utraquists]], [[Taborite]]s and Orphans</span>
				<span class='text'>Nearly six centuries later in 1999, Pope [[John Paul II]] expressed &quot;deep regret for the cruel death inflicted&quot; on Hus</span>

				<span class='text'>Jan Hus introduced improvements into medieval Czech language, such as the [[diacritic]] including the &quot;hook&quot; [[háček]] (ě,š,č,ř,ž), the &quot;dot&quot; above letters for strong accent, as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels (á,é,í,ó,ú), in order to represent each [[phoneme|sound]] by a single [[grapheme|symbol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the bible</span>
				<span class='text'>The symbol &quot;ů&quot; came later</span>
				<span class='text'>The book ''Orthographia Bohemica'' (1406) may have been written by Jan Hus, or by another author from Charles University</span>
				<span class='text'> Today, the [[Jan Hus Memorial]] is located at the Prague [[Old Town Square]] ([[Czech language|Czech]] ''Staroměstské náměstí''), and there are many smaller memorials in other towns</span>
				<span class='text'>n New York City, a church in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] (located at 153 Ocean Avenue), and a church and a theatre in [[Manhattan]] (located at 351 [[East 74th Street]]) are named for Hus: respectively the John Hus Moravian Church, the [[Jan Hus Presbyterian Church]] and the Jan Hus Playhouse</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Manhattan's church and theatre share a single building and management, the Playhouse's productions are usually non-religious or non-denominational</span>
				<span class='text'> statue of Jan Hus was erected at the Union Cemetery in [[Bohemia, New York]] (on [[Long Island]]) by Czech immigrants to the New York area in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>n contrast to the popular perception that Hus was a proto-Protestant, some Eastern Orthodox Christians have argued that his theology was far closer to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]</span>
