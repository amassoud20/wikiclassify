				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', Hokusai's most famous print, the first in the series ''36 Views of Mount Fuji'']]Hokusai's date of birth is not known for certain, but is often said to be the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the [[Hōreki]] era (in the [[Japanese calendar|old calendar]], or October 30, 1760) to an [[artisan]] family, in the Katsushika district of [[Edo]], Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston116&quot;/&gt; His childhood name was Tokitarō</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; It is believed his father was the mirror-maker Nakajima Ise, who produced mirrors for the [[shogunate|shogun]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; His father never made Hokusai an heir, so it is possible that his mother was a [[concubine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston116&quot;/&gt; Hokusai began painting around the age of six, possibly learning the art from his father, whose work on mirrors also included the painting of designs around the mirrors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston116&quot;/&gt;Hokusai was known by at least thirty names during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the use of multiple names was a common practice of Japanese artists of the time, the numbers of names he used far exceeds that of any other major Japanese artist</span>
				<span class='text'>Hokusai's name changes are so frequent, and so often related to changes in his artistic production and style, that they are used for breaking his life up into periods</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston116&quot;/&gt;At the age of 12, he was sent by his father to work in a bookshop and [[lending library]], a popular type of institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from wood-cut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston&quot;/&gt; At 14, he became an apprentice to a wood-carver, where he worked until the age of 18, whereupon he was accepted into the studio of [[Katsukawa Shunshō]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shunshō was an artist of [[ukiyo-e]], a style of wood block prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; Ukiyo-e, as practiced by artists like Shunshō, focused on images of the courtesans and [[Kabuki]] actors who were popular in Japan's cities at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;After a year, Hokusai's name changed for the first time, when he was dubbed Shunrō by his master</span>
				<span class='text'>It was under this name that he published his first prints, a series of pictures of Kabuki actors published in 1779</span>
				<span class='text'>During the decade he worked in Shunshō's studio, Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known except that she died in the early 1790s</span>
				<span class='text'>He married again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short time</span>
				<span class='text'>He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter Sakae, also known as [[Katsushika Ōi|Ōi]], eventually became an artist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;Upon the death of Shunshō in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to acquire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt; He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by Shunkō, the chief disciple of Shunshō, possibly due to studies at the rival [[Kanō school]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This event was, in his own words, inspirational: &quot;What really motivated the development of my artistic style was the embarrassment I suffered at Shunkō's hands</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lane&quot;/&gt;Hokusai also changed the subjects of his works, moving away from the images of courtesans and actors that were the traditional subjects of ukiyo-e</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, his work became focused on landscapes and images of the daily life of Japanese people from a variety of social levels</span>
				<span class='text'>This change of subject was a breakthrough in ukiyo-e and in Hokusai's career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt; ''Fireworks at Ryōgoku Bridge'' (1790) dates from this period of Hokusai's life</span>

				<span class='text'>He produced many brush paintings, called ''[[surimono]]'', and illustrations for ''kyōka ehon'' (illustrated book of humorous poems) during this time</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1798, Hokusai passed his name on to a pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties to a school for the first time, adopting the name Hokusai Tomisa</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Cranes Hokusai</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|300px|Cranes from ''Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing'']]By 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture</span>
				<span class='text'>He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo where he was born and the latter meaning, 'north studio'</span>
				<span class='text'>That year, he published two collections of landscapes, ''Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital'' and ''Eight Views of Edo''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also began to attract students of his own, eventually teaching 50 pupils over the course of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston117&quot;/&gt;He became increasingly famous over the next decade, both due to his artwork and his talent for self-promotion</span>
				<span class='text'>During a Tokyo festival in 1804, he created a portrait of the [[Buddhist]] priest [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]] said to be {{convert|600|ft|m}} long using a broom and buckets full of ink</span>
				<span class='text'>Another story places him in the court of the [[Tokugawa Ienari|Shogun Iyenari]], invited there to compete with another artist who practiced more traditional brush stroke painting</span>
				<span class='text'>Hokusai's painting, created in front of the Shogun, consisted of painting a blue curve on paper, then chasing across it a chicken whose feet had been dipped in red paint</span>
				<span class='text'>He described the painting to the Shogun as a landscape showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston1&quot;/&gt;1807 saw Hokusai collaborate with the popular novelist [[Takizawa Bakin]] on a series of illustrated books</span>
				<span class='text'>The two did not get along due to artistic differences, and their collaboration ended during work on their fourth book</span>
				<span class='text'>The publisher, given the choice between keeping Hokusai or Bakin on the project, opted to keep Hokusai, emphasizing the importance of illustrations in printed works of the period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston118&quot;/&gt;Hokusai paid close attention to the production of his work in books</span>
				<span class='text'>Two instances are documented in letters he wrote to the publishers and blockcutters involved in the production of his designs in ''Toshisen Ehon'', a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Hokusai writes to the book’s publisher that the blockcutter Egawa Tomekichi, with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai’s style in the cutting of certain heads</span>
				<span class='text'>Hokusai also wrote directly to another blockcutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the Utagawa-school style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure’s eyes and noses and that amendments would need to be made for the final prints to be true to Hokusai’s style</span>
				<span class='text'>In his letter Hokusai includes illustrated examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses, and the Utagawa–school style</span>
				<span class='text'>The publisher agreed to make these alterations, even with hundreds of copies of the book already printed</span>
				<span class='text'>To correct these details the already existing cut blocks would be corrected by use of the umeki technique</span>
				<span class='text'>The sections to be corrected would be removed and a prepared piece of wood inserted, into which the blockcutter would cut the revised design</span>
				<span class='text'>Use of the umeki technique can be detected by fine break marks bordering the inserted block</span>
				<span class='text'>Copies in print of both the original woodblock and those made of Hokusai’s requested revisions survive, printed in 1833 and 1836 respectively</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|300px|Image of bathers from the ''Hokusai manga'']]In 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to ''Taito'' and entered the period in which he created the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'' and various ''etehon'', or art manuals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nagata&quot;/&gt; These ''etehon'', beginning in 1812 with ''Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing'', served as a convenient way to make money and attract more students</span>
				<span class='text'>The first book of Hokusai's ''manga'', sketches or caricatures that influenced the modern form of comics known by the same name, was published in 1814</span>
				<span class='text'>Together, his 12 volumes of manga published before 1820 and three more published posthumously include thousands of drawings of animals, religious figures, and everyday people</span>
				<span class='text'>They often have humorous overtones, and were very popular at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston118&quot;/&gt;On October 5, 1817 he painted at the [[Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin]] in Nagoya the &quot;Big [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]]&quot; on paper, measuring 18x10</span>
				<span class='text'> metres, impressing many onlookers</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the original was destroyed in 1945, promotional handbills from that time survived and are preserved at the [[Nagoya City Museum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1820, Hokusai changed his name yet again, this time to &quot;Iitsu,&quot; a change which marked the start of a period in which he secured fame as an artist throughout Japan (though, given [[Sakoku|Japan's isolation]] from the outside world during his lifetime, his fame overseas came after his death)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was during the 1820s that Hokusai reached the peak of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>His most famous work, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', including the famous ''[[Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', dated from this period</span>
				<span class='text'>It proved so popular that Hokusai later added ten more prints to the series</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the other popular series of prints he published during this time are ''A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces'' and ''Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston2&quot;/&gt; He also began producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds, including the extraordinarily detailed ''Poppies'' and ''Flock of Chickens''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston119&quot;/&gt;==Later life==The next period, beginning in 1834, saw Hokusai working under the name &quot;Gakyō Rōjin Manji&quot; (The Old Man Mad About Art)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gvjh</span>
				<span class='text'>rg&quot;/&gt;  It was at this time that Hokusai produced ''[[One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji]]'', another significant landscape series</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;weston119&quot;/&gt;In the postscript to this work, Hokusai writes:{{quote|From the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of things and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all I drew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking in to account</span>
				<span class='text'>At  seventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds, insects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants</span>
				<span class='text'>And so, at eighty-six I shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their secret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the level of the marvellous and divine</span>

				<span class='text'>By this time, his career was beginning to fade as younger artists such as [[Andō Hiroshige]] became increasingly popular</span>
				<span class='text'>But Hokusai never stopped painting, and completed ''Ducks in a Stream'' at the age of 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Weston, p</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He died on May 10, 1849 (18th day of the 4th month of the 2nd year of the [[Kaei|Kaei era]] by the old calendar), and was buried at the [[Seikyō-ji]] in Tokyo (Taito Ward)</span>

				<span class='text'>hunga was enjoyed by both men and women of all classes</span>
				<span class='text'> Superstitions and customs surrounding shunga suggest as much; in the same way that it was considered a lucky charm against death for a samurai to carry shunga, it was considered a protection against fire in [[merchant]] warehouses and the home</span>
				<span class='text'> From this we can deduce that samurai, chonin, and housewives all owned shunga</span>
				<span class='text'> All three of these groups would suffer separation from the opposite sex; the samurai lived in barracks for months at a time, and conjugal separation resulted from the [[sankin-kōtai]] system and the merchants' need to travel to obtain and sell goods</span>

				<span class='text'>It actually consists of 46 prints (10 of them added after initial publication)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;''Costa Concordia: Threat of treasure hunters''&quot;/&gt;Both Hokusai’s choice of ''[[nom d'artiste]]'' and frequent depiction of [[Mount Fuji]] stem from his religious beliefs</span>

				<span class='text'>is influences also stretched to his western contemporaries in nineteenth century Europe whose new style [[Art Nouveau]], or [[Jugendstil]] in Germany, was influenced by him and by Japanese art in general</span>
				<span class='text'> This was also part of the larger [[Impressionist|Impressionism]] movement, with similar themes to Hokusai appearing in [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the Brooklyn Rail ''Many artists collected his woodcuts: [[Degas]], [[Gauguin]], [[Klimt]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Manet]], and [[van Gogh]] included</span>
