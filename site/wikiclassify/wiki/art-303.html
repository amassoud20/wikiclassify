				<span class='text'>==Watt and the kettle===There is a popular story that Watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling, the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing Watt the power of steam</span>
				<span class='text'>This story is told in many forms; in some Watt is a young lad, in others he is older, sometimes it's his mother's kettle, sometimes his aunt's</span>
				<span class='text'>James Watt of course did not actually ''invent'' the steam engine, as the story implies, but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing Newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser</span>
				<span class='text'>This is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>It appears that the story of Watt and the kettle was created, possibly by Watt's son James Watt Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this light it can be seen as akin to the story of Newton, the falling apple and his discovery of gravity</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough it is often dismissed as a myth, like most good stories the story of James Watt and the kettle has a basis in fact</span>
				<span class='text'>In trying to understand the [[thermodynamics]] of heat and steam James Watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam</span>

				<span class='text'>Murray|pages=74–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the [[Newcomen engine]], in use for almost 50 years for pumping water from mines, had hardly changed from its first implementation</span>
				<span class='text'> Watt began to experiment with steam, though he had never seen an operating steam engine</span>
				<span class='text'> He tried constructing a model; it failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>He came to realise the importance of [[latent heat]]—the [[thermal energy]] released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process—in understanding the engine, which, unknown to Watt, his friend Joseph Black had previously discovered some years before</span>
				<span class='text'>Understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state, for the science of [[thermodynamics]] would not be formalised for nearly another 100 years</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1763, Watt was asked to repair a model Newcomen engine belonging to the university</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Muirhead1858&quot;/&gt; Even after repair, the engine barely worked</span>
				<span class='text'>After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that about three-quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the [[Cylinder (engine)|engine cylinder]] on every cycle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;FrazerPa1859&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazer|first=Persifor|title=Journal of the Franklin Institute|url=https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder, the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into [[mechanical energy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>att's critical insight, arrived at in May 1765,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36&lt;/ref&gt; was to cause the steam to [[condense]] in a separate chamber apart from the [[piston]], and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a &quot;steam jacket</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FrazerPa1859&quot;/&gt; Thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle, making more available to perform useful work</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt had a working model later that same year</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|[[Cylinder (engine)|Cylinder]] fragment of Watt's first operational engine at the [[Carron Works]], Falkirk]]Despite a potentially workable design, there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a full-scale engine</span>
				<span class='text'>This required more capital, some of which came from Black</span>
				<span class='text'>More substantial backing came from [[John Roebuck]], the founder of the celebrated [[Carron Iron Works]] near [[Falkirk]], with whom he now formed a partnership</span>
				<span class='text'>Roebuck lived at [[Kinneil House]] in [[Bo'ness]], during which time Watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Iron (material)|Iron]] workers of the day were more like [[blacksmith]]s than modern machinists, and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision</span>
				<span class='text'>Much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on Watt's invention</span>
				<span class='text'>Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment—first as a [[surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], then as a civil engineer—for eight years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol I, pages 180–293&lt;/ref&gt;Roebuck went bankrupt, and [[Matthew Boulton]], who owned the [[Soho Foundry]] works near [[Birmingham]], acquired his patent rights</span>
				<span class='text'>An extension of the patent to 1800 was successfully obtained in 1775</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;James Watt's Fire Engines Patent Act, 1775 (15 Geo 3 c</span>
				<span class='text'>61)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, an [[Act of Parliament]] was required to obtain a patent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Through Boulton, Watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>The difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]], who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at [[Bersham Ironworks|Bersham]], near [[Wrexham]], [[North Wales]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership ([[Boulton and Watt]]) which lasted for the next twenty-five years</span>
				<span class='text'>==First engines===[[File:SteamEngine Boulton&amp;Watt 1784</span>

				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Watt steam engine}}{{Main|Watt's linkage}}{{Main|Watt's curve}}In 1776, the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises</span>
				<span class='text'>These first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft</span>
				<span class='text'>The design was commercially successful, and for the next five years Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in [[Cornwall]] for pumping water out of mines</span>
				<span class='text'>hese early engines were not manufactured by Boulton and Watt, but were made by others according to drawings made by Watt, who served in the role of consulting engineer</span>
				<span class='text'>The erection of the engine and its [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] was supervised by Watt, at first, and then by men in the firm's employ</span>
				<span class='text'>These were large machines</span>
				<span class='text'>The first, for example, had a cylinder with a diameter of some 50&amp;nbsp;inches and an overall height of about 24 feet, and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it</span>
				<span class='text'>Boulton and Watt charged an annual payment, equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a Newcomen engine performing the same work</span>
				<span class='text'>he field of application for the invention was greatly widened when Boulton urged Watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding, weaving and milling</span>
				<span class='text'>Although a [[crank (mechanism)|crank]] seemed the obvious solution to the conversion Watt and Boulton were stymied by a patent for this, whose holder, [[James Pickard]], and associates proposed to cross-license the external condenser</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their [[sun and planet gear]] in 1781</span>
				<span class='text'>ver the next six years, he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine</span>
				<span class='text'>A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one</span>
				<span class='text'>He described methods for working the steam &quot;expansively&quot; (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> using steam at pressures well above atmospheric)</span>
				<span class='text'>A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described</span>
				<span class='text'>Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782</span>
				<span class='text'>Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these included the use of the steam [[indicator diagram|indicator]] which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a [[trade secret]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the [[parallel motion]] which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a [[circular arc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was patented in 1784</span>
				<span class='text'>A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a [[centrifugal governor]], patented in 1788,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Richard|title=Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1991|page=60|isbn=978-0-203-40252-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep it from &quot;running away&quot; were very important</span>
				<span class='text'>These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause of the danger of exploding [[boilers]], which were in a very primitive stage of development, and the ongoing issues with leaks, Watt restricted his use of high pressure steam&amp;nbsp;– all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|A steam engine built to James Watt's patent in 1848 at [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] in Germany]][[Edward Bull]] started constructing engines for Boulton and Watt in Cornwall in 1781</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1792 he had started making engines of his own design, but which contained a separate condenser, and so infringed Watt's patents</span>
				<span class='text'>Two brothers, [[Jabez Carter Hornblower]] and [[Jonathan Hornblower| Jonathan Hornblower Jnr]] also started to build engines about the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>Others began to modify Newcomen engines by adding a condenser, and the mine owners in Cornwall became convinced that Watt's patent could not be enforced</span>
				<span class='text'>They started to withhold payments due to Boulton and Watt, which by 1795 had fallen</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the total £21,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|21000|1795|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) owed, only £2,500 had been received</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, ch 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;He first sued Bull in 1793</span>
				<span class='text'>The jury found for Watt, but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, injunctions were issued against the infringers, forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow</span>
				<span class='text'>The trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive, but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers, except for Jonathan Hornblower, all began to settle their cases</span>
				<span class='text'>Hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges (in 1799) was decisively in favour of Watt</span>
				<span class='text'>Their friend John Wilkinson, who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder, was a particularly grievous case</span>
				<span class='text'>He had erected about twenty engines without Boulton's and Watts' knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>They finally agreed to settle the infringement in 1796</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roll p 158&lt;/ref&gt; Boulton and Watt never collected all that was owed them, but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration</span>
				<span class='text'>These trials were extremely costly in both money and time, but ultimately were successful for the firm</span>
				<span class='text'>==Copying machine===Before 1780 there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>The only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens</span>
				<span class='text'> Watt at first experimented with improving this method, but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome</span>
				<span class='text'> He instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet, moistened with a solvent, and pressed to the original</span>
				<span class='text'>The second sheet had to be thin, so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light, thus reproducing the original exactly</span>

				<span class='text'>1, as quoted at Quaritch</span>
				<span class='text'>om 12 Oct 13&lt;/ref&gt;Watt started to develop the process in 1779, and made many experiments to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer</span>
				<span class='text'>All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and [[James Keir]] (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co</span>
				<span class='text'>The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years</span>
				<span class='text'>Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hills vol 3 p 116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century</span>
				<span class='text'>==Chemical experiments===From an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by [[Berthollet]] in which he reacted [[hydrochloric acid]] with [[manganese dioxide]] to produce [[chlorine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals</span>
				<span class='text'>When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process</span>
				<span class='text'> He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and [[sulphuric acid]] could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method</span>
				<span class='text'>He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow</span>
				<span class='text'>Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction</span>
				<span class='text'>About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not until 1799, when [[Charles Tennant]] patented a process for producing solid [[bleaching powder]] (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1794 Watt had been chosen by [[Thomas Beddoes]] to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new [[Pneumatic Institution]] at [[Hotwells]] in Bristol</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years, but by 1797 the medical uses for the &quot;factitious airs&quot; had come to a dead end</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, pp152-158&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Watt apparatus 3</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Scientific apparatus designed by [[Boulton and Watt]] in preparation of the [[Pneumatic Institution]] in Bristol]]===Personality===Watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Humphry Davy]] said of him &quot;Those who consider James Watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character; he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist, and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences, and that peculiar characteristic of genius, the union of them for practical application&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>They produced almost none of the parts themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Watt did most of his work at his home in Harper's Hill in Birmingham, while Boulton worked at the [[Soho Manufactory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts, and by 1795 they purchased a property about a mile away from the Soho manufactory, on the banks of the [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal]], to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Soho Foundry]] formally opened in 1796 at a time when Watt's sons, Gregory and [[James Watt Jr</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, pp 230–231&lt;/ref&gt;He and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in mid-Wales at Doldowlod House, one mile south of [[Llanwrthwl]], which he much improved</span>
