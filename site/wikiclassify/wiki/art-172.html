				<span class='text'>Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows</span>
				<span class='text'>===''The Godfather'' (1972)===={{Main|The Godfather}}The release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Coppola had to face a lot of difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; [[Italy|Italian]] director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Christopher Frayling| title = Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone| url = https://books</span>

(1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G</span>
				<span class='text'>Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, &quot;smell the spaghetti&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]), documentary film about Evans' life&lt;/ref&gt;There was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that &quot;Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Look&quot;&gt;''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept</span>
				<span class='text'>Coppola would later recollect:&lt;ref name=&quot;Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3&quot; /&gt;{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it</span>
				<span class='text'>They were very unhappy with it</span>

				<span class='text'>I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that</span>
				<span class='text'>We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it</span>
				<span class='text'>They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job</span>
				<span class='text'>}After it was released, the film received widespread praise</span>
				<span class='text'>It went on to win multiple awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;====''The Conversation'' (1974)===={{Main|The Conversation}}Coppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time&quot; /&gt; The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)&lt;ref&gt;Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p</span>
				<span class='text'>152&lt;/ref&gt; and generated a lot of speculation and interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental</span>
				<span class='text'>The script for ''The Conversation,'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[United States Presidential election, 1968|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)===={{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}During the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, &quot;I don't think that script was [actually] made</span>

				<span class='text'>George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: &quot;You have two films</span>
				<span class='text'>Take one away, it doesn't work&quot;, referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use &quot;Part II&quot; in its title</span>
				<span class='text'>Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor</span>
