				<span class='text'>He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with [[Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Neill418&quot;&gt;O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), 418&lt;/ref&gt;Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all [[English poets]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jorge Luis Borges]] stated that his first encounter with Keats was the most significant literary experience of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''This Craft of Verse'', Jorge Luis Borges, (Harvard University Press, 2000), 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the series of [[John Keats's 1819 odes|odes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This is typical of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through the emphasis of natural imagery</span>
				<span class='text'>Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life===John Keats was born in Moorgate, London, on 31 October 1795 to Thomas Keats and his wife, born Frances Jennings</span>

				<span class='text'>The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Poemsletters&quot;/&gt; In the family atmosphere at Clarke's, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life</span>
				<span class='text'>The headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to [[Renaissance]] literature, including [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[George Chapman|Chapman's translations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, &quot;always in extremes&quot;, given to indolence and fighting</span>
				<span class='text'>However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Poemsletters&quot;&gt;Gittings (1987), 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;In April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died</span>
				<span class='text'>The cause of death was a skull fracture, suffered when he fell from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''John Keats'', Colvin, S, (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Keats died [[intestacy|intestate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Frances remarried two months later, but left her new husband soon afterwards, and the four children went to live with their grandmother, Alice Jennings, in the village of [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Monckton Milnes (1848), xiii&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1810 when Keats was 14, his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving the children in the custody of their grandmother</span>
				<span class='text'>She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, to take care of them</span>
				<span class='text'>That autumn, Keats left Clarke's school to apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family</span>
				<span class='text'>Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Cowden Clarke, who remained a close friend of Keats, described this period as &quot;the most placid time in Keats's life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Motion (1999), 46&lt;/ref&gt;===Early career===From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his grandfather John Jennings (about £34,000 in today's money) and a portion of his mother's legacy, £8000 (about £340,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Keats's share would have increased on the death of his brother Tom in 1818</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money</span>
				<span class='text'>Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware</span>
				<span class='text'>William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a [[duty of care]] to relay the information to Keats</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems he did not</span>
				<span class='text'>The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations</span>
				<span class='text'>Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/poem&gt;|source =The sonnet &quot;On First Looking into Chapman's Homer&quot;&lt;br /&gt;October 1816}}Having finished his apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered as a medical student at [[Guy's Hospital]] (now part of [[King's College London]]) and began studying there in October 1815</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a month of starting, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital, assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Keats's long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poemsletters&quot;/&gt; He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including [[Henry Stephens (doctor)|Henry Stephens]] who became a famous inventor and ink magnate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1998), 74&lt;/ref&gt;However, Keats's training took up increasing amounts of his writing time, and he was increasingly ambivalent about his medical career</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt that he faced a stark choice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Poemsletters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motion (1998), 98&lt;/ref&gt; He had written his first extant poem, &quot;An Imitation of Spenser,&quot; in 1814, when he was 19</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Lord Byron]], and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression</span>
				<span class='text'>His brother George wrote that John &quot;feared that he should never be a poet, &amp; if he was not he would destroy himself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, Keats received his [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|apothecary's licence]], which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician, and surgeon, but before the end of the year he announced to his guardian that he was resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt;Although he continued his work and training at Guy's, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet &quot;O Solitude&quot; in his magazine, ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', a leading liberal magazine of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hirsch&quot;&gt;Hirsch, Edward (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first appearance in print of Keats's poetry, and [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] described it as his friend's red letter day,&lt;ref&gt;Colvin (2006), 35&lt;/ref&gt; the first proof that Keats's ambitions were valid</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his poems of 1816 was ''To My Brothers''</span>

				<span class='text'>There he began &quot;Calidore&quot; and initiated the era of his great letter writing</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself for further study in order to become a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1998), 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;In October, Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley</span>
				<span class='text'>Five months later came the publication of ''Poems'', the first volume of Keats's verse, which included &quot;I stood tiptoe&quot; and &quot;Sleep and Poetry,&quot; both strongly influenced by Hunt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;hirsch&quot;/&gt; The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in ''The Champion''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Poemsletters&quot;/&gt; Clarke commented that the book &quot;might have emerged in Timbuctoo</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;!---sic---&gt;&lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Keats's publishers, [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]], felt ashamed of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>Keats immediately changed publishers to [[John Taylor (English publisher)|Taylor and Hessey]] on [[Fleet Street]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion proposes that the Olliers suggested Keats leave their publishing lists</span>
				<span class='text'>See Motion (1997) p156&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Olliers, Keats's new publishers were enthusiastic about his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a month of the publication of ''Poems'' they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance</span>
				<span class='text'>Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet</span>
				<span class='text'>Their publishing lists eventually included [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[John Clare|Clare]], [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg|Hogg]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[Charles Lamb|Lamb]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 156&lt;/ref&gt;Through Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their [[Eton College|Eton]]-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by ''Poems''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he noted that Keats could be &quot;wayward, trembling, easily daunted,&quot; Woodhouse was convinced of Keats's genius, a poet to support as he became one of England's greatest writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about Keats's poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats's work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Andrew Motion represents him as [[James Boswell|Boswell]] to Keats' [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]], ceaselessly promoting the writer's work, fighting his corner, and spurring his poetry to greater heights</span>
				<span class='text'>In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few people to accompany Keats to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] to embark on his final trip to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 157&lt;/ref&gt;In spite of the bad reviews of ''Poems'', Hunt published the essay &quot;Three Young Poets&quot; ([[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], Keats, and [[John Hamilton Reynolds|Reynolds]]) and the sonnet &quot;[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]],&quot; foreseeing great things to come</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gittings (1968), 155&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of ''[[The Times]]'', [[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]]; the writer [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]; the conductor [[Vincent Novello]]; and the poet [[John Hamilton Reynolds]], who would become a close friend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 116–120&lt;/ref&gt; He was also regularly meeting [[William Hazlitt]], a powerful literary figure of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a decisive turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed &quot;a new school of poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997) 130&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey: &quot;I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neill418&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keats' letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817&lt;/ref&gt; This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of &quot;[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]&quot;:  {{&quot;'}}Beauty is truth, truth beauty' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In early December, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey that he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury</span>
				<span class='text'>Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training and, despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, had made large loans to friends such as painter [[Benjamin Haydon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Keats would go on to lend £700 to his brother George</span>
				<span class='text'>By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bate (1964) p632&lt;/ref&gt;Having left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London,  Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of [[Hampstead]] in April 1817</span>
				<span class='text'>Both John and George nursed their brother Tom, who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The house was close to Hunt and others from his circle in Hampstead, as well as to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, at that time living in [[Highgate]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 11 April 1818, Keats and Coleridge had a long walk together on [[Hampstead Heath]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to his brother George, Keats wrote that they talked about &quot;a thousand things,</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 365–66&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he was introduced to [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]] and James Rice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 364, 184&lt;/ref&gt;In June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the [[Lake District]] with his friend [[Charles Armitage Brown]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Keats' brother George and his wife Georgina accompanied them as far as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and then continued to [[Liverpool]], from where the couple emigrated to America</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived in [[Ohio]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky]], until 1841, when George's investments failed</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Keats' other brother, they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment until the next century</span>

				<span class='text'>Agnes and other poems'' was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity in so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats's work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Neill418&quot; /&gt;Although prolific during his short career, and now one of the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, [[John Keats's 1819 odes|centred on the Odes]],&lt;ref&gt;Strachan (2003), 2&lt;/ref&gt; and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;Walsh (1957), 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, &quot;I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember'd</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt;  His admirers praised him for thinking &quot;on his pulses&quot;, for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities, more gorgeous in its effects, more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him: 'loading every rift with ore'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Keats Letter To Percy Bysshe Shelley, 16 August 1820&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keats's death had been brought on by bad reviews in the ''Quarterly Review''</span>
				<span class='text'>Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote ''[[Adonaïs]]'', a despairing elegy,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adonaïs]]'' by Shelley is a despairing [[elegy]]of 495 lines and 55 [[Spenserian stanza]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>It was published that July 1820 and he came to view it as his &quot;least imperfect&quot; work</span>

				<span class='text'>He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft</span>
				<span class='text'>His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;Walsh&quot;/&gt; His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's ''Examiner'', which Keats read as a boy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name= &quot;Poems18&quot;&gt;Gittings (1987), 18–21&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt scorned the [[Augustan poetry|Augustan]] or 'French' school, dominated by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, during Keats's few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb</span>
				<span class='text'>Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a 'new school' for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis from the scathing attacks from ''Blackwoods'' and ''The Quarterly''</span>

				<span class='text'>Keats's posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers' caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of the hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling, which Shelley later portrayed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name= &quot;Poems18&quot;/&gt;The Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gittings3&quot;/&gt; Shortly after his death, his publishers announced they would speedily publish ''The memoirs and remains of John Keats'' but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to the extent that the project was abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>Leigh Hunt's ''Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries'' (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats's supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gittings3&quot;&gt;Gittings (1968), 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, early accounts often gave contradictory or heavily biased versions of events and were subject to dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gittings3&quot;/&gt; His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats's life</span>
				<span class='text'>These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gittings (1968), 5&lt;/ref&gt;Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Motion (1997), 499&lt;/ref&gt; The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes</span>
				<span class='text'>Landmark Keats biographers since include [[Sidney Colvin]], [[Robert Gittings]], [[Walter Jackson Bate]]  and [[Andrew Motion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity</span>

				<span class='text'>Eliot]]  ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1937) p100''&lt;/ref&gt; Keats spent a great deal of time considering poetry itself, its constructs and impacts, displaying a deep interest unusual amongst his milieu who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics, fashions or science</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot wrote of Keats's conclusions; &quot;There is hardly one statement of Keats' about poetry which&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Eliot]]  ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1937) p101''&lt;/ref&gt;Few of Keats's letters are extant from the period before he joined his literary circle</span>
				<span class='text'>From spring 1817, however, there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive skills as letter writer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Keats and his friends, poets, critics, novelists, and editors wrote to each other daily, and Keats' ideas are bound up in the ordinary, his day-to-day missives sharing news, parody and social commentary</span>
				<span class='text'> They glitter with humour and critical intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Born of an &quot;unself-conscious stream of consciousness,&quot; they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;PaL12&quot;/&gt; When his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in great detail, the body of letters becoming &quot;the real diary&quot; and self-revelation of Keats's life, as well as containing an exposition of his philosophy, and the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats's finest writing and thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gittings (1968), 66&lt;/ref&gt; Gittings describes them as akin to a &quot;spiritual journal&quot; not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;PaL12&quot;/&gt;Keats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry, and specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;PaL12&quot;/&gt; In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as &quot;the vale of Soul-making&quot;, &lt;!--- Keats's capitalisation---&gt; anticipating the great odes that he would write some months later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref Name=&quot;PaL12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to George Keats, Sunday 14 February 1819&lt;/ref&gt; In the letters, Keats coined ideas such as the [[Mansion of Many Apartments]] and the [[Chameleon Poet]], concepts that came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, despite only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scott, Grant (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, Selected Letters of John Keats, Harvard University Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The poetical mind, Keats argued:&lt;blockquote&gt;has no self – it is every thing and nothing – It has no character – it enjoys light and shade;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet</span>
				<span class='text'>It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation</span>
				<span class='text'>A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity – he is continually in for – and filling some other Body – The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute – the poet has none; no identity – he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;He used the term [[negative capability]] to discuss the state in which we are &quot;capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason&amp;nbsp;</span>
