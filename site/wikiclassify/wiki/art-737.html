				<span class='text'>ithin twelve weeks of Congolese independence in 1960, Lumumba's government was deposed in a coup during the [[Congo Crisis]] following his attempt to solicit support from the [[Soviet Union]] against [[State of Katanga|Katangan secessionists]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>President [[John F</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, ''JFK'' (1983), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>69–70</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Kasavubu-Mobutu regime began to consider the Kennedy administration a threat to its very survival</span>
				<span class='text'>The Kennedy plan was seen as evidence of 'a new and unexpected solidarity with the Casablanca powers </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> (the radical nonaligned African governments that supported Lumumba)</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The CIA station in Léopoldville bore much of the responsibility for the rupture</span>
				<span class='text'>It had opposed any political solution to the power struggle and, worse, had fortified the resolve of Kasavubu and Mobutu, Nendaka, and the rest to use violence against others to save themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The effect was tragic: reports that the incoming administration planned to liberate the imprisoned Lumumba on the one hand, and the CIA's deadly urgings on the other, acted like a closing vice on the desperate men in Léopoldville</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lumumba was killed three days before [[Inauguration of John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy|Kennedy's inauguration]] on 20 January, though Kennedy would not learn of the killing until 13 February</span>

				<span class='text'>Although some sources claim that CIA plots ended when Lumumba was captured, that is not stated or shown in the CIA records</span>

				<span class='text'>The former, after a long censored section, talks about where they need to go from there</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter expresses thanks for Lumumba being sent to them and then says that, had Elizabethville base known he was coming, they would have &quot;baked a snake&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;FOIA declassified documents on Lumumba on the CIA website&lt;/ref&gt; This cable goes on to state that the writer's sources (not yet declassified) said that after being taken from the airport Lumumba was imprisoned by &quot;all white guards&quot;</span>
