				<span class='text'> Following an education in a strict religious and ethical environment as an [[altar boy]] at the [[vicarage]] of Jimpley, he became a rather isolated, independent and disciplined person, and acquired a knowledge and an appreciation for the [[scientific method]] in a practical world</span>
				<span class='text'>His first career choice was [[agriculture]], at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where he was a part of the fraternity of Alpha Kappa Lambda, followed by history and then [[religion]]</span>

				<span class='text'> To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled ''Why am I entering the Ministry?'', after which he decided to change his career</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1924, he graduated from University of Wisconsin and enrolled at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1987, Rogers suffered a fall that resulted in a fractured [[human pelvis|pelvis]]: he had life alert and was able to contact paramedics</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a successful operation, but his pancreas failed the next night and he died a few days later</span>
				<span class='text'>ogers's last years were devoted to applying his theories in situations of political oppression and national social conflict, traveling worldwide to do so</span>
				<span class='text'> In [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], he brought together influential Protestants and Catholics; in South Africa, blacks and whites; in Brazil people emerging from dictatorship to democracy in the United States, consumers and providers in the health field</span>
				<span class='text'>His last trip, at age 85, was to the Soviet Union, where he lectured and facilitated intensive experiential workshops fostering communication and creativity</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;===Nineteen propositions===His theory (as of 1951) was based on 19 propositions:&lt;ref name=&quot;r51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Client-centered therapy: Its current practice, implications and theory</span>
				<span class='text'>first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1951 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84119-840-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;#All individuals (organisms) exist in a continually changing world of experience (phenomenal field) of which they are the center</span>
				<span class='text'>The organism reacts to the field as it is experienced and perceived</span>
				<span class='text'>This perceptual field is &quot;reality&quot; for the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>The organism reacts as an organized whole to this phenomenal field</span>
				<span class='text'>A portion of the total perceptual field gradually becomes differentiated as the self</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of interaction with the environment, and particularly as a result of evaluational interaction with others, the structure of the self is formed - an organized, fluid but consistent conceptual pattern of perceptions of characteristics and relationships of the &quot;I&quot; or the &quot;me&quot;, together with values attached to these concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>The organism has one basic tendency and striving - to actualize, maintain and enhance the experiencing organism</span>
				<span class='text'>The best vantage point for understanding behavior is from the internal frame of reference of the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>Behavior is basically the goal-directed attempt of the organism to satisfy its needs as experienced, in the field as perceived</span>
				<span class='text'>Emotion accompanies, and in general facilitates, such goal directed behavior, the kind of emotion being related to the perceived significance of the behavior for the maintenance and enhancement of the organism</span>
				<span class='text'>The values attached to experiences, and the values that are a part of the self-structure, in some instances, are values experienced directly by the organism, and in some instances are values introjected or taken over from others, but perceived in distorted fashion, as if they had been experienced directly</span>
				<span class='text'>As experiences occur in the life of the individual, they are either, a) symbolized, perceived and organized into some relation to the self, b) ignored because there is no perceived relationship to the self structure, c) denied symbolization or given distorted symbolization because the experience is inconsistent with the structure of the self</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the ways of behaving that are adopted by the organism are those that are consistent with the concept of self</span>
				<span class='text'>In some instances, behavior may be brought about by organic experiences and needs which have not been symbolized</span>
				<span class='text'>Such behavior may be inconsistent with the structure of the self but in such instances the behavior is not &quot;owned&quot; by the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>Psychological adjustment exists when the concept of the self is such that all the sensory and visceral experiences of the organism are, or may be, assimilated on a symbolic level into a consistent relationship with the concept of self</span>
				<span class='text'>Psychological maladjustment exists when the organism denies awareness of significant sensory and visceral experiences, which consequently are not symbolized and organized into the gestalt of the self structure</span>
				<span class='text'>When this situation exists, there is a basic or potential psychological tension</span>
				<span class='text'>Any experience which is inconsistent with the organization of the structure of the self may be perceived as a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Under certain conditions, involving primarily complete absence of threat to the self structure, experiences which are inconsistent with it may be perceived and examined, and the structure of self revised to assimilate and include such experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>When the individual perceives and accepts into one consistent and integrated system all his sensory and visceral experiences, then he is necessarily more understanding of others and is more accepting of others as separate individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>As the individual perceives and accepts into his self structure more of his organic experiences, he finds that he is replacing his present value system - based extensively on introjections which have been distortedly symbolized - with a continuing organismic valuing process</span>
				<span class='text'>dditionally, Rogers is known for practicing &quot;[[unconditional positive regard]],&quot; which is defined as accepting a person &quot;without negative judgment of </span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Development of the personality===With regard to development, Rogers described principles rather than stages</span>

				<span class='text'>It is a fluid and changing gestalt, a process, but at any given moment it is a specific entity</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In the development of the self-concept, he saw conditional and unconditional positive regard as key</span>
				<span class='text'>Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Those raised in an environment of conditional positive regard feel worthy only if they match conditions (what Rogers describes as ''conditions of worth'') that have been laid down for them by others</span>
				<span class='text'>==The fully functioning person===Optimal development, as referred to in proposition 14, results in a certain process rather than static state</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes this as ''the good life'', where the organism continually aims to fulfill its full potential</span>
				<span class='text'>He listed the characteristics of a fully functioning person (Rogers 1961):&lt;ref name=&quot;r61&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=On becoming a person: A therapist's view of psychotherapy |first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1961 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84529-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;#A growing openness to experience – they move away from defensiveness and have no need for subception (a perceptual defense that involves unconsciously applying strategies to prevent a troubling stimulus from entering consciousness)</span>
				<span class='text'>An increasingly existential lifestyle – living each moment fully – not distorting the moment to fit personality or self-concept but allowing personality and self-concept to emanate from the experience</span>
				<span class='text'>This results in excitement, daring, adaptability, tolerance, spontaneity, and a lack of rigidity and suggests a foundation of trust</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;To open one's spirit to what is going on now, and discover in that present process whatever structure it appears to have&quot; (Rogers 1961)&lt;ref name=&quot;r61&quot;/&gt;#Increasing organismic trust – they trust their own judgment and their ability to choose behavior that is appropriate for each moment</span>
				<span class='text'>They do not rely on existing codes and social norms but trust that as they are open to experiences they will be able to trust their own sense of right and wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>Freedom of choice – not being shackled by the restrictions that influence an incongruent individual, they are able to make a wider range of choices more fluently</span>
				<span class='text'>They believe that they play a role in determining their own behavior and so feel responsible for their own behavior</span>
				<span class='text'>Creativity – it follows that they will feel more free to be creative</span>
				<span class='text'>They will also be more creative in the way they adapt to their own circumstances without feeling a need to conform</span>
				<span class='text'>Reliability and constructiveness – they can be trusted to act constructively</span>
				<span class='text'>An individual who is open to all their needs will be able to maintain a balance between them</span>
				<span class='text'>Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congruent individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>A rich full life – he describes the life of the fully functioning individual as rich, full and exciting and suggests that they experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and courage more intensely</span>
				<span class='text'>Rogers' description of ''the good life'':{{quote|''This process of the good life is not, I am convinced, a life for the faint-hearted</span>
				<span class='text'>It involves the stretching and growing of becoming more and more of one's potentialities</span>
				<span class='text'>It involves the courage to be</span>
				<span class='text'>It means launching oneself fully into the stream of life</span>
				<span class='text'>' (Rogers 1961)&lt;ref name=&quot;r61&quot;/&gt;}}===Incongruence===Rogers identified the &quot;[[real self]]&quot; as the aspect of one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the &quot;you&quot; that, if all goes well, you will become</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, to the extent that our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an &quot;ideal self&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet</span>
				<span class='text'>This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the &quot;I am&quot; and the &quot;I should&quot; is called ''incongruity''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Psychopathology===Rogers described the concepts of ''congruence'' and ''incongruence'' as important ideas in his theory</span>
				<span class='text'>In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he recognized the need for ''positive regard''</span>
				<span class='text'>In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard</span>
				<span class='text'>They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine</span>
				<span class='text'>Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential</span>
				<span class='text'>Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others</span>
				<span class='text'>They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside out</span>
				<span class='text'>ogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning</span>
				<span class='text'>They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept</span>
				<span class='text'>Because their lives are not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat</span>
				<span class='text'>They deploy ''defense mechanisms'' to achieve this</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes two mechanisms: ''distortion'' and ''denial''</span>
				<span class='text'>Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept</span>
				<span class='text'>They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept</span>
				<span class='text'>his defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself</span>
				<span class='text'>And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self-concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self structure</span>
				<span class='text'>If the incongruence is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic</span>
				<span class='text'> Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable</span>
				<span class='text'>If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruence of their situation</span>
				<span class='text'>Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably</span>
				<span class='text'>=Applications=={{main|Person-centered therapy|Student-centered learning}}===Person-centered therapy==={{main|Person-centered therapy}}Rogers originally developed his theory to be the foundation for a system of therapy</span>
				<span class='text'>He initially called this &quot;non-directive therapy&quot; but later replaced the term &quot;non-directive&quot; with the term &quot;client-centered&quot; and then later used the term &quot;person-centered&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Even before the publication of ''Client-Centered Therapy'' in 1951, Rogers believed that the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts and not just in the therapy situation</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he started to use the term ''person-centered approach'' later in his life to describe his overall theory</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Person-centered therapy]] is the application of the person-centered approach to the therapy situation</span>
				<span class='text'>Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, [[cross-cultural]] relations and other &quot;helping&quot; professions and situations</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946 Rogers co-authored &quot;Counseling with Returned Servicemen,&quot; with John L</span>
				<span class='text'>Wallen (the creator of the behavioral model known as ''[[The Interpersonal Gap]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C</span>

				<span class='text'>64&lt;/ref&gt;===Learner-centered teaching===The application to education has a large robust research tradition similar to that of therapy with studies having begun in the late 1930s and continuing today (Cornelius-White, 2007)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rogers described the approach to education in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' and wrote ''Freedom to Learn'' devoted exclusively to the subject in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>''Freedom to Learn'' was revised two times</span>
				<span class='text'>The new Learner-Centered Model is similar in many regards to this classical person-centered approach to education</span>
				<span class='text'>ogers and Harold Lyon began a book prior to Rogers death, entitled ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher --  Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R</span>
				<span class='text'>Rogers and Harold Lyon'', which was completed by Lyon and Reinhard Tausch and published in 2013 containing Rogers last unpublished writings on person-centered teaching</span>

				<span class='text'>Rogers and Harold Lyon</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers had the following five hypotheses regarding learner-centered education:&lt;references group=&quot;Rogers, Carl R, Lyon, Harold C</span>
				<span class='text'> Tausch, Reinhard: (2013) On Becoming an Effective Teacher - Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Diologues with Carl R</span>
				<span class='text'>Rogers and Harold Lyon</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Routledge:&quot; /&gt;#“A person cannot teach another person directly; a person can only facilitate another's learning” (Rogers, 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>This is a result of his personality theory, which states that everyone exists in a constantly changing world of experience in which he or she is the center</span>
				<span class='text'>Each person reacts and responds based on perception and experience</span>
				<span class='text'>The belief is that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does</span>
				<span class='text'>The focus is on the student (Rogers, 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, the background and experiences of the learner are essential to how and what is learned</span>
				<span class='text'>Each student will process what he or she learns differently depending on what he or she brings to the classroom</span>
				<span class='text'>“A person learns significantly only those things that are perceived as being involved in the maintenance of or enhancement of the structure of self” (Rogers, 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, relevancy to the student is essential for learning</span>
				<span class='text'>The students' experiences become the core of the course</span>
				<span class='text'>“Experience which, if assimilated, would involve a change in the organization of self, tends to be resisted through denial or distortion of symbolism” (Rogers, 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>If the content or presentation of a course is inconsistent with preconceived information, the student will learn if he or she is open to varying concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>Being open to consider concepts that vary from one's own is vital to learning</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, gently encouraging open-mindedness is helpful in engaging the student in learning</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, it is important, for this reason, that new information be relevant and related to existing experience</span>
				<span class='text'>“The structure and organization of self appears to become more rigid under threats and to relax its boundaries when completely free from threat” (Rogers, 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>If students believe that concepts are being forced upon them, they might become uncomfortable and fearful</span>
				<span class='text'>A barrier is created by a tone of threat in the classroom</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, an open, friendly environment in which trust is developed is essential in the classroom</span>
				<span class='text'>Fear of retribution for not agreeing with a concept should be eliminated</span>
				<span class='text'>A classroom tone of support helps to alleviate fears and encourages students to have the courage to explore concepts and beliefs that vary from those they bring to the classroom</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, new information might threaten the student’s concept of him- or herself; therefore, the less vulnerable the student feels, the more likely he or she will be able to open up to the learning process</span>
				<span class='text'>“The educational situation which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (a) threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum and (b) differentiated perception of the field is facilitated” (Rogers, 1951)</span>
				<span class='text'>The instructor should be open to learning from the students and also working to connect the students to the subject matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Frequent interaction with the students will help achieve this goal</span>
				<span class='text'>The instructor's acceptance of being a mentor who guides rather than the expert who tells is instrumental to student-centered, nonthreatening, and unforced learning</span>
				<span class='text'>==Rogerian rhetorical approach===In 1970, Richard Young, [[Alton L</span>
				<span class='text'>Becker]], and [[Kenneth Pike]] published ''Rhetoric: Discovery and Change'', a widely influential college writing textbook that used a [[Rogerian argument|Rogerian approach]] to communication to revise the traditional Aristotelian framework for rhetoric</span>
				<span class='text'>The Rogerian method of argument involves each side restating the other's position to the satisfaction of the other</span>
				<span class='text'>In a paper, it can be expressed by carefully acknowledging and understanding the opposition, rather than dismissing them</span>

				<span class='text'> The meeting was notable for several reasons: it brought national figures together as people (not as their positions), it was a private event, and was an overwhelming positive experience where members heard one another and established real personal ties, as opposed to stiffly formal and regulated diplomatic meetings</span>
