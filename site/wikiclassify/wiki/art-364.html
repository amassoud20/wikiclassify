				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frances Wood, ''[[Did Marco Polo Go to China?]]'' (London: Secker &amp; Warburg; Boulder, Colorado: Westview, 1995)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Responses to skeptics have stated that if the purpose of Polo's tales was to impress others with tales of his high esteem for an advanced civilization, then it is possible that Polo shrewdly would omit those details that would cause his listeners to scoff at the Chinese with a sense of European superiority; Marco lived among the Mongol elite; foot binding was rare even among Chinese during Polo's time and almost unknown among the Mongols; the Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders; researchers note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the [[Yuan Dynasty|Mongol]] rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both north and south of today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=polo/&gt;Supporters of the book's basic accuracy have replied</span>
				<span class='text'>The British scholar Ronald Latham has pointed out that ''The Book of Marvels'' was in fact a collaboration written in 1298–1299 between Polo and a professional writer of romances, Rustichello of Pisa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Latham pages 7&quot;&gt;Latham, Ronald &quot;Introduction&quot; pages 7–20 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 page 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rustichello's intention was to use today's language, to write a best-seller, and as such he preferred to stress the fantastic, bizarre and the romantic at the expense of accuracy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Latham pages 7&quot;/&gt; Latham has argued that today it is difficult to tell today precisely just how much of ''The Book of Marvels'' was Polo and how much Rustichello</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Latham pages 7&quot;/&gt; However, it is firmly established that the book was written in the same &quot;leisurely, conversational style&quot; that characterized Rustichello's other books, which would very strongly suggest that ''The Book of Marvels'' was written by Rustichello with Polo just merely reminiscing about his travels to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Latham pages 7&quot;/&gt; Likewise, the opening introduction in ''The Book of Marvels'' to &quot;emperors and kings, dukes and marquises&quot; was lifted straight out of an [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian romance]] Rustichello had written several years earlier, and many of the episodes in ''The Book of Marvels'' were taken out of the same Arthurian romance to be reset in China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Latham pages 7&quot;/&gt; For an example, in his Arthurian romance, Rustichello described the first arrival of Sir Tristan at the court of King Arthur at Camelot; the first meeting described between Polo and Kubla Khan at the latter's court is almost the same right down to the same words used in the Arthurian romance with only Polo inserted in place of Sir Tristan and Kubla Khan in place of King Arthur, and a few other adjustments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Latham, Ronald &quot;Introduction&quot; pages 7–20 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 pages 11–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, much of the account of the [[Battle of Xiangyang|Siege of Xiangyang]] is a reworked version of an epic siege by King Arthur described in Rustichello's Arthurian romance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Latham pages 7&quot;/&gt; Latham wrote that many of the fantastic aspects in ''The Book of Marvels'' were added in by Rusticello who was giving what medieval European readers expected to find in a travel book</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Latham, Ronald &quot;Introduction&quot; pages 7–20 from ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', London: Folio Society, 1958 page 12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As such, the fantastic and bizarre accounts of people with heads of dogs or faces in their chests—which were staples of medieval travel literature—were almost certainly the work of Rustichello</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same way, Rustichello may have dropped references to ordinary life in China that were presumably of little interest to a European audience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Lathem wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There are other features of the book that are as likely to be due to Rustichello as to Marco, such as the tendency to glamorize the status of the Polos at the Tartar court, particularly their relation to the princess entrusted to their care, the vein of facetiousness that often accompanies references to their sexual customs and the eagerness to acclaim every exotic novelty as a 'marvel'</span>
				<span class='text'>It is likely that without the aid of Rustichello Marco would never have written a best-seller</span>
				<span class='text'>Conceivably he might have produced something not much more readable than [[Francesco Balducci Pegolotti|Pegolotti]]'s ''[[Pratica della mercatura|Handbook]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>More probably he would never have written a book at all&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Latham noted that there are references to daily life, culture, geography and history of China and the Far East in general that would have been unknown to someone like Rusticello, and that could only had come from Polo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Latham, Ronald &quot;Introduction&quot; pages 7–20 from The Travels of Marco Polo, London: Folio Society, 1958 page 12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As far as it can be established, Rusticello had never been further east than the Holy Land, which he visited as a pilgrim; as such, Rusticello would known something of the Near East, and the rest of Asia would have been unknown to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Latham, Ronald &quot;Introduction&quot; pages 7–20 from The Travels of Marco Polo, London: Folio Society, 1958 page 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Tübingen]] Sinologist and historian Hans Ulrich Vogel argued that Polo's description of paper money and [[Salt in Chinese history#Early modern technology|salt production]] supported his presence in China because he included details which he could not have otherwise known</span>

				<span class='text'>Many problems were caused by the oral transmission of the original text and the proliferation of significantly different hand-copied manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, did Polo exert &quot;political authority&quot; (''seignora'') in Yangzhou or merely &quot;sojourn&quot; (''sejourna'') there</span>
				<span class='text'>Elvin concludes that &quot;those who doubted, although mistaken, were not always being casual or foolish,&quot; but &quot;the case as a whole had now been closed&quot;: the book is, &quot;in essence, authentic, and, when used with care, in broad terms to be trusted as a serious though obviously not always final, witness</span>
