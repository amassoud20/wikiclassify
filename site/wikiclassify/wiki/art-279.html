				<span class='text'>Both ''Rabbit Is Rich'' (1982) and ''Rabbit at Rest'' (1990) were recognized with the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Updike is one of only three authors to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once (the others were [[Booth Tarkington]] and [[William Faulkner]])</span>

				<span class='text'>Hundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' starting in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote regularly for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>In New York, Updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like ''[[The Carpentered Hen]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Same Door]]'' (1959)</span>
				<span class='text'>These works were influenced by Updike's early engagement with ''The New Yorker''</span>

				<span class='text'>Over 500 pages long, the novel is among Updike's most celebrated</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Eulogizing Updike in January 2009, the British novelist [[Ian McEwan]] wrote that Updike's &quot;literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]]&quot;, and that Updike's death marked &quot;the end of the golden age of the American novel in the 20th century's second half</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; McEwan concluded that the Rabbit series is Updike's &quot;masterpiece and will surely be his monument&quot;, and describing it, concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;Updike is a master of effortless motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic</span>
				<span class='text'>For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson</span>
				<span class='text'>This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike</span>
				<span class='text'>his is at the heart of the tetralogy's achievement</span>
				<span class='text'>Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an exercise in point of view</span>
				<span class='text'>This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth</span>
				<span class='text'>Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of [[realism (arts)|realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, &quot;and not chop them down to what you think is the right size&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, ''The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief'' (2000), &quot;John Updike's Complacent God&quot;, Modern Library, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>192</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Updike's ''Licks of Love'' (2001), Wood concluded that Updike's &quot;prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons&quot;, but that there often exists in his work a &quot;hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Wood both praises and criticizes Updike's language for having &quot;an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He writes that Updike is capable of writing &quot;the perfect sentence&quot; and notes that Updike's unique style is characterized by a &quot;delicate deferral&quot; of the sentence</span>
				<span class='text'>The beauty of Updike's language and his faith in the power of that language floats above reality, according to Wood:&lt;blockquote&gt;For some time now Updike's language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer</span>
				<span class='text'>Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss</span>
				<span class='text'>For all his fabled [[Protestantism]], both American [[Puritan]] and [[Lutheran]]-[[Karl Barth|Barthian]], with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than [[Balzac]], in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books—[[Rabbit Remembered|here extended a further instance]]—suggests continuance</span>
				<span class='text'>Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us—'life's gallant, battered ongoingness ', indeed—and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Updike's language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Karshan calls Updike an inheritor of the &quot;traditional role of the epic writer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to Karshan, &quot;Updike's writing picks up one voice, joins its cadence, and moves on to another, like Rabbit himself, driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Disagreeing with Wood's critique of Updike's alleged over-stylization, Karshan evaluates Updike's language as convincingly naturalistic:&lt;blockquote&gt;Updike's sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, like [[Proust]]'s sentences in Updike's description, they &quot;seek out an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Updike aspires to &quot;this sense of self-qualification, the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that [[Cézanne]] shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on</span>
				<span class='text'>If life is bountiful in [[New England]], it is also evasive and easily missed</span>
				<span class='text'>In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken</span>
				<span class='text'>His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>But love is precarious, Updike is always saying, since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He sang like Henry James, but he saw like [[Sinclair Lewis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gopnik&quot;/&gt; The critic [[James Wolcott]], in a review of Updike's last novel, ''[[The Widows of Eastwick]]'' (2008), notes that Updike's penchant for observing America's decline is coupled with an affirmation of America's ultimate merits: &quot;Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: [[Don DeLillo]], Gore Vidal, Philip Roth</span>

				<span class='text'>Critics have often noted that Updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the [[Henry Bech]] series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language</span>
