				<span class='text'>He was the first child of [[Charles I of Hungary]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary|Elizabeth of Poland]], to survive infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>A 1338 treaty between his father and [[Casimir III of Poland]], Louis's maternal uncle, confirmed Louis's right to inherit the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] if his uncle died without a son</span>
				<span class='text'>In exchange, Louis was obliged to assist his uncle to reoccupy the lands that Poland had lost in previous decades</span>
				<span class='text'>He bore the title of [[Duke of Transylvania]] between 1339 and 1342 but did not administer the province</span>
				<span class='text'>ouis was of age when succeeded his father in 1342, but his deeply religious mother exerted a powerful influence on him</span>
				<span class='text'>He inherited a centralized kingdom and a rich treasury from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>During the first years of his reign, Louis launched a [[Northern crusades|crusade]] against the [[Lithuanians]] and restored royal power in [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Croatia]]; his troops defeated a [[Tatars|Tatar]] army, expanding his authority towards the [[Black Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When his brother, [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria]], husband of Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]], was assassinated in 1345, Louis accused the queen of his murder and punishing her became the principal goal of his foreign policy</span>
				<span class='text'>He launched two campaigns to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] between 1347 and 1350</span>
				<span class='text'>His troops occupied large territories on both occasions, and Louis adopted the styles of [[King of Naples|Neapolitan sovereigns]] (including the title of King of Sicily and [[King of Jerusalem#Claimant kings of Jerusalem (1291 until today)|Jerusalem]]), but the [[Holy See]] never recognized his claim</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis's arbitrary acts and atrocities committed by his mercenaries made his rule unpopular in [[Southern Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He withdrew all his troops from the Kingdom of Naples in 1351</span>
				<span class='text'>ike his father, Louis administered Hungary with absolute power and used [[royal prerogative]]s to grant privileges to his courtiers</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he also confirmed the liberties of the [[Hungarian nobility]] at the [[Diet of Hungary|Diet]] of 1351, emphasizing the equal status of all noblemen</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same Diet, he introduced an [[Fee tail|entail]] system and a uniform rent payable by the peasants to the landowners, and confirmed the right to free movement for all peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>He waged wars against the Lithuanians, [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and the [[Golden Horde]] in the 1350s, restoring the authority of Hungarian monarchs over territories along frontiers that had been lost during previous decades</span>
				<span class='text'>He forced the [[Republic of Venice]] to renounce the [[Dalmatia]]n towns in 1358</span>
				<span class='text'>He also made several attempts to expand his suzerainty over the rulers of [[Banate of Bosnia|Bosnia]], [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]], [[Principality of Wallachia|Wallachia]], and parts of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and Serbia</span>
				<span class='text'>These rulers were sometimes willing to yield to him, either under duress or in the hope of support against their internal opponents, but Louis's rule in these regions was only nominal during most of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>His attempts to convert his pagan or Orthodox subjects to Catholicism made him unpopular in the Balkan states</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis established a university in [[Pécs]] in 1367, but it was closed within two decades because he did not arrange for sufficient revenues to maintain it</span>
				<span class='text'>ouis inherited Poland after his uncle's death in 1370</span>
				<span class='text'>Since he fathered only daughters, he wanted his subjects to acknowledge the right of his daughters to succeed him in both Hungary and Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>For this purpose, he issued the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] in 1374 spelling out the liberties of [[Szlachta|Polish noblemen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his rule remained unpopular in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hungary, he authorized the [[royal free cities|royal free towns]] to delegate jurors to the high court hearing their cases and set up a new high court</span>
				<span class='text'>Suffering from a [[cutaneous condition|skin disease]], Louis became even more religious during the last years of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of the [[Western Schism]], he acknowledged [[Pope Urban VI]] as the legitimate [[pope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the pope dethroned Joanna I of Naples and made Louis's distant cousin, [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]], king of Naples, Louis helped Charles occupy the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hungarian historiography, Louis was regarded for centuries as the most powerful Hungarian monarch who ruled over an empire &quot;whose shores were washed by three seas&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2002|pp=45, 47}}He had a liberal education by the standards of his age and learned [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=48}} However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Engel|2001|p=170}} In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on his shoulders</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=48}}{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=47}} His two tutors, [[Nicholas Drugeth]] and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria|Andrew]], when [[Felician Záh]] attempted to assassinate the royal family in [[Visegrád]] on 17 April 1330</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=74}} A year later, Louis accompanied his father in invading [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=48}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=50}} On 1 March 1338, John of Bohemia's son and heir, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], [[Margrave of Moravia]], signed a new treaty with Charles I of Hungary and Louis in [[Visegrád]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=50}}{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=95}} According to the treaty, Charles of Moravia acknowledged the right of Charles I's sons to succeed their maternal uncle, [[Casimir III of Poland]], if Casimir died without a male issue</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=51}} Louis also pledged that he would marry the margrave's three-year-old daughter, [[Margaret of Bohemia, Queen of Hungary|Margaret]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=51}}Casimir III's first wife, [[Aldona of Lithuania]], died on 26 May 1339</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Knoll|1972|pp=97–98}} According to the 15th-century [[Jan Długosz]], Casimir held a [[general sejm]] in [[Cracow]] where &quot;the assembled prelates and nobles&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Długosz_1339_p289&quot;&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'' (A</span>

				<span class='text'>1339), p</span>
				<span class='text'>289</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed Louis as Casimir's heir, but the reference to the sejm is anachronistic</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=98}} Historian Paul W</span>
				<span class='text'>Knoll writes that Casimir preferred his sister's family to his own daughters or a member of a [[cadet branch]] of the [[Piast dynasty]], because he wanted to ensure the king of Hungary's support against the [[Teutonic Knights]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=98}} Louis's father and uncle signed a treaty in [[Visegrád]] in July whereby Casimir III made Louis his heir if he died without a son</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=206}} In exchange, Charles I pledged that Louis would reoccupy [[Pomerania]] and other Polish lands lost to the [[Teutonic Order]] without Polish funds and would only employ Poles in the royal administration in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=98}}Louis received the title of [[Duke of Transylvania]] from his father in 1339, but he did not administer the province</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=52}} Although Louis had attained the age of majority, his mother Elizabeth &quot;acted as a sort of co-regent&quot; for decades, because she exerted a powerful influence on him</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Engel|2001|p=171}} Louis inherited a rich treasury from his father, who had strengthened royal authority and ruled without holding [[Diet of Hungary|Diets]] during the last decades of his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=140, 157}}Louis introduced a new system of land grants, excluding the grantee's brothers and other kinsmen from the donation in contrast with customary law: such estates [[escheat]]ed to the Crown if the grantee's last male descendants died</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Engel|2001|p=178}} On the other hand, Louis often &quot;[[Prefection|promoted a daughter to a son]]&quot;, that is authorized a daughter to inherit her father's estates, although customary law prescribed that the landed property of a deceased nobleman who had no sons was to be inherited by his kinsmen</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=178–179}} Louis often granted this privilege to the wives of his favorites</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Engel|2001|p=179}} Louis also frequently [[jus gladii|authorized landowners to apply capital punishment]] in their estates, limiting the authority of the magistrates of the [[County (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=49}} Louis especially favored the [[Lackfi]]s: eight members of the family held high offices during his reign</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=182}} Louis and his mother regarded this as an infringement of a previous agreement between the late kings of Naples and Hungary</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=55}} He visited his bride's father, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Moravia]], in [[Prague]] to persuade him to intervene on Andrew's behalf with Charles's former tutor, [[Pope Clement VI]], the overlord of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=55}}{{sfn|Kristó|2002|pp=49–50}} Louis also sent envoys to his Neapolitan relatives and the high officials of the kingdom, urging them to promote his brother's interests</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=55}} Their mother, Elizabeth, left for Naples in the summer, taking with her almost the whole royal treasure, including more than {{convert|6628|kg|lb}} of silver and {{convert|5150|kg|lb}} of gold</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=76–77}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=156, 159}} During her seven-month-long stay in Italy, she was only able to persuade her daughter-in-law and the pope to promise that Andrew would be crowned as Joanna's husband</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=57}}According to the nearly contemporaneous chronicle of [[John of Küküllő]], Louis launched his first campaign against a group of [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who had refused to pay taxes, and forced them to yield in the summer of 1344</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=91, 94}} During his stay in Transylvania, [[Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia|Nicholas Alexander]]{{spaced ndash}}who was the son of [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab]], the ruling [[prince of Wallachia]]{{spaced ndash}}swore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in [[Brașov|Brassó]] (now Brașov in [[Romania]]); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over [[Wallachia]] was, at least outwardly, restored</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=208}} He dispatched Andrew Lackfi to invade the lands of the [[Golden Horde]] in retaliation for the [[Tatars]]' earlier plundering raids against Transylvania and the [[Szepesség]] (now Spiš in Slovakia)</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kłoczowski|1986|p=139}}John of Küküllő emphasized that Louis &quot;ruled neither with passion, nor with arbitrariness, but rather as the guardian of righteousness&quot;</span>
