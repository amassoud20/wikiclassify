				<span class='text'> Born and raised in [[Virginia]], Wilson earned a PhD in political science, working as a professor and scholar at various institutions before being chosen as [[President of Princeton University]], where he worked from 1902 to 1910</span>
				<span class='text'> In the election of 1910, he was the gubernatorial candidate of [[New Jersey]]'s Democratic Party, and was elected the 34th [[Governor of New Jersey]], serving from 1911 to 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>Running for president in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], a split in the Republican Party allowed his plurality, just over forty percent, to win him a large electoral college margin</span>
				<span class='text'>As President, Wilson was a leading force in the [[Progressive Movement]], bolstered by his [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party's]] winning control of both the White House and Congress in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>n office, Wilson reintroduced the spoken [[State of the Union]], which had been out of use since 1801</span>
				<span class='text'>Leading the Congress, now in Democratic hands, he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the [[New Deal]] in 1933</span>

				<span class='text'>201&lt;/ref&gt; Included among these were the [[Federal Reserve Act]], [[Federal Trade Commission Act]], the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], and the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Having taken office one month after ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], Wilson called a special session of Congress, whose work culminated in the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], reintroducing an [[Income Tax in the United States|income tax]] and lowering tariffs</span>
				<span class='text'> Through passage of the [[Adamson Act]], imposing an 8-hour workday for railroads, he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis</span>

				<span class='text'> Wilson's second term was dominated by [[American entry into World War I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1917, when Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make &quot;the world safe for democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The United States conducted military operations alongside the Allies, although without a formal alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>During the war, Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations, leaving military strategy to the generals, especially General [[John J</span>

				<span class='text'> Loaning billions of dollars to Britain, France, and other Allies, the United States aided their finance of the war effort</span>
				<span class='text'>Through the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], conscription sent 10,000 freshly trained soldiers to France, per day, by summer of 1918</span>
				<span class='text'> On the home front, he raised income taxes, borrowing billions of dollars through the public's purchase of [[Liberty Bonds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He set up the [[War Industries Board]], promoted [[Labor history of the United States|labor union]] cooperation, regulating agriculture and food production through the [[Food and Fuel Control Act|Lever Act]], and granting to the Secretary of the Treasury, [[William Gibbs McAdoo|William McAdoo]], direct control of the nation's railroad system</span>
				<span class='text'>n his 1915 State of the Union, Wilson asked Congress for what became the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], suppressing anti-draft activists</span>

				<span class='text'>Mitchell Palmer]] to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the [[First Red Scare]] of 1919–1920</span>
				<span class='text'>Following years of advocacy for suffrage on the state level, in 1918 he endorsed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] whose ratification provided [[Women's suffrage in the United States|all women the right to vote]] by its ratification in 1920, over Southern opposition</span>

				<span class='text'>Following his return from Europe, Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour in 1919 to campaign for the treaty, suffering a severe stroke</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty was met with serious concern by Senate Republicans, and Wilson rejected a compromise effort led by [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], leading to the Senate's rejection of the treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to his stroke, Wilson secluded himself in the White House, disability having diminished his power and influence</span>
				<span class='text'> Forming a strategy for reelection, Wilson deadlocked the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]], but his bid for a third term nomination was overlooked</span>

				<span class='text'>democratic republic and British parliament contrast===Wilson, a disciple of [[Walter Bagehot]], considered the [[United States Constitution]] to be cumbersome and open to corruption</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson favored a [[parliamentary system]] for the United States and in the early 1880s wrote, &quot;I ask you to put this question to yourselves, should we not draw the Executive and Legislature closer together? Should we not, on the one hand, give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president, and the president, on the other hand, a better chance to approve himself a statesman, and his advisers capable men of affairs, in the guidance of Congress</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of Woodrow Wilson'', 41–48&lt;/ref&gt;Wilson's first political work, ''Congressional Government'' (1885), advocated a parliamentary system</span>
				<span class='text'>He critically described the United States government, with frequent negative comparisons to [[Westminster system|Westminster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics contended the book was written without the benefit of the author observing any operational aspect of the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Congress, and supporters asserted the work was the product of the imagination of a future statesman</span>
				<span class='text'>The book reflected the greater power of the legislature, relative to the executive, during the post-bellum period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>75–76, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson later became a regular contributor to  ''[[Political Science Quarterly]],'' an academic journal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>83</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wilson's second publication in 1890 was a textbook, entitled ''The State'', used widely in college courses throughout the country until the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that government should not be deemed evil and advocated the use of government to allay social ills and advance society's welfare</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in 1889 Wilson contributed to a U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>historical series, covering the period from Pres</span>
				<span class='text'>Jackson through Reconstruction</span>
				<span class='text'>His third book, entitled ''Division and Reunion'', was published in 1893 and considered an outstanding contribution to American historical writing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>103</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's fourth publication, a five-volume work entitled ''History of the American People'', was the culmination of a series of articles written for ''[[Harper's]]'', and was published in 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Wilson wrote in &quot;The State&quot; that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare &quot;by forbidding child labor, by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories, by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to their health, by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold, by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades, [and] by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to out-do the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry</span>

				<span class='text'>186–187</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilson singled out the [[United States House of Representatives]] for particular criticism, saying,&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>divided up, as it were, into forty-seven seignories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the court-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor</span>
				<span class='text'>These petty barons, some of them not a little powerful, but none of them within reach [of] the full powers of rule, may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within their own shires, and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=PhD_p76&gt;Wilson ''Congressional Government'' 1885, p</span>
				<span class='text'>76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his last scholarly work, ''Constitutional Government of the United States'' (1908), Wilson said that the presidency &quot;will be as big as and as influential as the man who occupies it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; By the time of his presidency, Wilson hoped that presidents could be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological, not geographic, lines</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote, &quot;Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties: No leaders, no principles; no principles, no parties</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Frozen Republic'', 145&lt;/ref&gt;Wilson also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and &quot;made the imperative legal duty of the whole,&quot; a position which, according to Robert M</span>
				<span class='text'>Saunders, seemed to indicate that Wilson &quot;was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state</span>

				<span class='text'>k}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Public administration===Wilson also studied public administration, which he called &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>overnment in action; it is the executive, the operative, the most visible side of government, and is of course as old as government itself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson 3&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the study of public administration could enable officials to increase governmental efficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Study of Administration&quot; in ''Political Science Quarterly'', June 1887&lt;/ref&gt; He faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere &quot;practical detail&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations</span>
				<span class='text'>By his day, he thought, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 4&lt;/ref&gt; He thought it time &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>o straighten the paths of government, to make its business less unbusinesslike, to strengthen and purify its organization, and it to crown its dutifulness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilson 5&lt;/ref&gt; He summarized the growth of such foreign states as Prussia, France, and England, highlighting the events that led to advances in administration</span>
				<span class='text'>y contrast, he thought the United States required greater compromise because of the diversity of public opinion and the difficulty of forming a majority opinion; thus practical reform to the government was necessarily slow</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet Wilson insisted that &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>dministration lies outside the proper sphere of politics&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 10&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>eneral laws which direct these things to be done are as obviously outside of and above administration</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; He likened administration to a machine that functions independent of the changing mood of its leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a line of demarcation is intended to focus responsibility for actions taken on the people or persons in charge</span>
				<span class='text'>As Wilson put it, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ublic attention must be easily directed, in each case of good or bad administration, to just the man deserving of praise or blame</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no danger in power, if only it be not irresponsible</span>
				<span class='text'>If it be divided, dealt out in share to many, it is obscured</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the items under the discretion of administration must be limited in scope, as to not block, nullify, obfuscate, or modify the implementation of governmental decree made by the executive branch</span>

				<span class='text'>110&quot;/&gt;Although the school's endowment was barely $4&amp;nbsp;million, Wilson sought $2&amp;nbsp;million for a preceptorial system of teaching, $1&amp;nbsp;million for a school of science, and nearly $3&amp;nbsp;million for new buildings and salary increases</span>
				<span class='text'>As a long-term objective, Wilson sought $3&amp;nbsp;million for a graduate school and $2</span>

				<span class='text'>Students were to meet for these in groups of six with preceptors, followed by two years of concentration in a selected major</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to raise admission standards and to replace the &quot;gentleman's C&quot; with serious study</span>

				<span class='text'>Modern medical opinion surmises Wilson had suffered a stroke—he later was diagnosed, as his father had been, with [[arteriosclerosis|hardening of the arteries]]; he took a Bermuda vacation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>156</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 Wilson had, somewhat prophetically, described his problem, in the sesquicentennial speech at Princeton: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>our thorough Presbyterian is not subject to the ordinary laws of life, is of too stubborn a fiber, too unrelaxing a purpose, to suffer mere inconvenience to bring defeat&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Prospect House, Wilson's home on [[Princeton University|Princeton's]] campus]]When Wilson began vacationing in Bermuda in 1906, he met a socialite, Mary Hulbert Peck</span>
				<span class='text'>Their visits together became a regular occurrence on his return</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson in his letters home to Ellen openly related these gatherings as well his other social events</span>
				<span class='text'>According to biographer [[August Heckscher II|August Heckscher]], Ellen could sense a problem, and it became the topic of frank discussion between them</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson historians have not conclusively established there was an affair; but Wilson did on one occasion write a musing in shorthand—on the reverse side of a draft for an editorial: &quot;my precious one, my beloved Mary&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During his time at Princeton, he attempted to curtail the influence of social elites by abolishing the upper-class [[eating club]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed moving the students into colleges, also known as quadrangles</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson's Quad Plan was met with fierce opposition from Princeton's alumni</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson persisted, saying that giving in &quot;would be to temporize with evil&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walworth 1:109&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1907, due to the intensity of alumni opposition, the Board of Trustees withdrew its support for the Quad Plan and instructed Wilson to withdraw it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bragdon, ''Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years'', 326–327</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterward, Wilson suffered a recurrence of his 1906 ailment; as before, a vacation was prescribed and proved beneficial</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>173&quot;/&gt;Late in his tenure, Wilson had a confrontation with [[Andrew Fleming West]], dean of the graduate school, and also West's ally ex-President [[Grover Cleveland]], who was a trustee</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the campus core, while West preferred a more distant campus site</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1909 Wilson's final year at Princeton began with a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to the graduate school being located off campus; the acceptance of this condition by the board was a pivotal defeat for Wilson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>183</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The national press covered the confrontation as a battle between the elites, represented by West, versus the populists, represented by Wilson</span>
				<span class='text'>rom its outset, Wilson became disenchanted with resistance to his recommendations at Princeton; he ruminated on future political leadership</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to the Democratic presidential nominating convention in 1908, Wilson had dropped hints to some influential players in the Democratic Party of his interest in the Democratic ticket</span>
				<span class='text'>While he had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket, he did leave instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination</span>
				<span class='text'>And then he was off for a vacation in Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Party regulars considered his ideas politically as well as geographically detached and fanciful</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>

				<span class='text'>His campaign then increased its focus upon the elimination of monopoly in all forms</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Wilson's second wife Edith Bolling]]In a 1914 dispute between Colorado miners and [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|their company]], a confrontation resulted in the [[Ludlow Massacre]]—the deaths of eight strikers, eleven children and two mothers</span>
				<span class='text'>Part owner [[John D</span>
				<span class='text'>Rockefeller, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] refused Wilson's offer of mediation, conditioned upon collective bargaining, so Wilson sent in U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>troops</span>
				<span class='text'>While Wilson succeeded in bringing order to the situation, and demonstrated support for the labor union, the miners' unconditional surrender to the implacable owners was a defeat for Wilson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>330</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;His wife Ellen's failing health, due to [[Bright's disease|kidney failure]], worsened in the spring of 1914; after a fall, she was bedridden, then rallied briefly, but Wilson wrote &quot;my dear one… grows weaker and weaker, with a pathetic patience and sweetness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He was at her bedside to the end, which came August 6, when Wilson despairingly said &quot;Oh my God, what am I to do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Wilson later wrote accurately of his mourning and depression, &quot;Of course you know what has happened to me…God has stricken me almost beyond what I can bear&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Six months of depression followed for him, though mourning continued</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time that Wilson's private world shattered, World War I broke out in Europe, and this momentously changed his political life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>333–335</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In January 1915, Wilson emerged from his depression during a spirited speech in Indianapolis where he said, &quot;the trouble with the Republican Party is that it has not had a new idea for thirty years… the Republican Party is still a covert and a refuge for those who are afraid, for those who want to consult their grandfathers about everything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>345</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another sign of Wilson's emotional restoration was the aggressiveness with which he pursued passage of a ship-purchase bill to bulk up the inadequately equipped merchant marine</span>
				<span class='text'>This lasted until March 1915, when he moderated, drew back from the bill and, without its passage, congratulated the Congress for its work in the session just ended—his initial journey through mourning was evident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>347</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In February 1915 Wilson had met [[Edith Wilson|Edith Bolling Galt]], an attractive southern widow and jeweler</span>
				<span class='text'>After several meetings, he fell in love, and in May, Wilson proposed</span>
				<span class='text'>He was rebuffed initially but Wilson was undeterred and the courtship continued</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>348–350</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Edith initially did not pursue the furtherance of their physical interaction with the vigor of Wilson, but she gradually warmed to the relationship and they became secretly engaged in the fall of 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>352–353</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Many in Wilson's camp had become concerned about the appearance of a premature romance soon after the death of his wife; the engagement was made public in October and they were married on December 18</span>

				<span class='text'>to enter World War I]]From 1914 until early 1917, Wilson's primary objective was to keep America out of the [[World War I|war in Europe]], and his policy was, &quot;the true spirit of neutrality, which is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>339</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a 1914 address to Congress, Wilson argued, &quot;Such divisions amongst us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace, the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation, not as a partisan, but as a friend</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In early 1915 Germany declared the waters around Great Britain to be a war zone; Wilson dispatched a note of protest, imposing &quot;strict accountability&quot; on Germany for the safety of neutral ships</span>
				<span class='text'>The meaning of the policy, dubiously applied to specific incidents, evolved with the policy of neutrality, but ultimately formed the substance of U</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>361&quot;/&gt; In the spring of 1915 a German bomb struck an American ship, the ''Cushing'' and a German submarine torpedoed an American tanker, the ''Gulflight''</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson took the view, based on some reasonable evidence, that both incidents were accidental, and that a settlement of claims could be postponed to the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>362</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;A German submarine torpedoed and sank the British ocean liner RMS ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' in May 1915; over a thousand perished, including many Americans</span>
				<span class='text'>In a Philadelphia speech that weekend Wilson said, &quot;There is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight</span>
				<span class='text'>There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Many reacted to these remarks with contempt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>363, 365</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilson sent a subdued note to the Germans protesting its submarine warfare against commerce; the initial reply was evasive and received in the United States with indignation</span>
				<span class='text'>Secretary of State Bryan, a dedicated pacifist, sensing the country's path to war, resigned, and was replaced by [[Robert Lansing]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The White Star liner the ''Arabic'' was then torpedoed, with two American casualties</span>
				<span class='text'>The U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>threatened a diplomatic break unless Germany repudiated the action; the German ambassador then conveyed a note, &quot;liners will not be sunk by our submarines&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson had not stopped the submarine campaign, but won agreement that unarmed merchant ships would not be sunk without warning; and most importantly he had kept the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>out of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>366–369</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Wilson requested and received funds in the final 1916 appropriations bill to provide for 500,000 troops</span>
				<span class='text'>It also included a five-year Navy plan for major construction of battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines—showing Wilson's dedication to a big Navy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>378</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In March 1916 the ''Sussex'', an unarmed ferry under the French flag, was torpedoed in the English Channel and four Americans were counted among the dead; the Germans had flouted the post-''Lusitania'' exchanges</span>
				<span class='text'>The president demanded the Germans reject their submarine tactics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>384–385&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson drew praise when he succeeded in wringing from Germany a pledge to constrain their U-boat warfare to the rules of cruiser warfare</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a clear departure from existing practices—a diplomatic concession from which Germany could only more brazenly withdraw, and regrettably did</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>387</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Coincidentally, early 1916 brought two separate Mexican incidents in which thirty-six Americans were killed by the forces of Pancho Villa; Wilson ordered [[John J</span>
				<span class='text'>Pershing|Gen</span>
				<span class='text'>John Pershing]] and 4000 troops across the border to reinforce Carranza</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>388</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In early April, though Villa had not been captured, Pershing's forces had broken up and dispersed his bands; yet, the forces continued their pursuit</span>
				<span class='text'>Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion; a confrontation in Parral resulted in two dead Americans and two wounded, plus hundreds of Mexican casualties</span>
				<span class='text'>Pershing, recommending the railroads be seized and the country occupied, was ordered by Wilson to withdraw</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>389</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wilson made a plea for postwar union in May 1916; his speech recited the right of every nation to its sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom from aggression</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;So sincerely do we believe these things&quot;, Wilson said, &quot;that I am sure that I speak the mind and wish of the people of America when I say that the United States is willing to become a partner in any feasible association of nations formed in order to realize these objectives&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>At home the speech was seen as a turning point in policy</span>
				<span class='text'>In Europe the words were received by the British and the French without comment</span>
				<span class='text'>His harshest European critics rightly thought the speech reflected indifference on Wilson's part; indeed, Wilson never wavered from a belief that the war was the result of corrupt European power politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>392</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wilson made his final offer to mediate peace on December 18, 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>As a preliminary, he asked both sides to state their minimum terms necessary for future security</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Central Powers]] replied that victory was certain, and the Allies required the dismemberment of their enemies' empires; no desire for peace existed, and the offer lapsed</span>

				<span class='text'>Once the Congress passed the Adamson bill incorporating the president's proposal, the strike was cancelled</span>

				<span class='text'>Wilson is standing next to [[Georges Clemenceau]] at right</span>
				<span class='text'>]When the time came, Wilson spent six months in Paris for the Peace Conference—thereby the first U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>president to travel to Europe while in office, and the first to visit the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>458</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilson disembarked from the ''George Washington'' in Brest on December 13; he took a break from the negotiations and departed February 14, 1919 for home, then returned to Paris three weeks later and remained until the conclusion of a treaty in June</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>500&lt;/ref&gt;Heckscher describes Wilson, during the first four weeks of the Conference as, &quot;playing, with force and discretion, a commanding role…he established his priorities, secured accommodation on major issues and won preliminary acceptance of the League</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>536</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He promoted his plan in France, and then at home in February</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson gave a speech at the Metropolitan Opera House in defense of the League—he was more insistent about it than ever</span>
				<span class='text'>Heckscher contends that the enduring image of Wilson as a grim, unsmiling and unforgiving figure dates from this visit home during the conference</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>538</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While the general public along with editorial writers, churches and peace groups generally favored the League, the Republicans vowed to defeat the League and discredit Wilson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>539</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wilson notably did not address the Congress as to ongoing deliberations at the peace conference, as indeed his counterpart Lloyd George did with Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>Heckscher opines that this was a missed opportunity to forge the debate even though the Congressional majority had changed</span>
				<span class='text'>In France he was without the usual control over his message through the media; in fact, the French initiated an aggressive propaganda campaign in the midst of the Conference to affect its outcome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>541</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the conclusion of the visit home Wilson suffered an illness en route to France; the ensuing months brought a decline in health and in power and prestige</span>
				<span class='text'>On arrival, it was immediately clear the conference had struggled in his absence—Col</span>
				<span class='text'>House had compromised Wilson's prior gains, and Wilson set out to attempt to regain the lost ground</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p</span>
				<span class='text'>544–545</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During these &quot;dark days&quot; of the conference Taft cabled to Wilson three proposed amendments to the League covenant which he thought would considerably increase its acceptability to the Europeans—the right of withdrawal from the League, the exemption of domestic issues from the League and the inviolability of the Monroe Doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson very reluctantly accepted these amendments, explaining why he later was more inflexible in the Senate treaty negotiations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>551–553</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On April 3 Wilson fell violently ill during a conference meeting, in a narrow escape from influenza</span>
				<span class='text'>Though his symptoms receded within a couple of days, those around him noticed a distinct, lasting deterioration</span>
