				<span class='text'>3%}}'''George Herman''' &quot;'''Babe'''&quot; '''Ruth, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>'' (February 6, 1895&amp;nbsp;– August 16, 1948) was an American professional [[baseball]] player whose career in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) spanned 22&amp;nbsp;seasons, from 1914 through 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicknamed  &quot;'''The Bambino'''&quot; and &quot;'''The Sultan of Swat'''&quot;, he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed [[pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]], but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging [[outfielder]] for the [[New York Yankees]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career [[home run]]s (714), [[runs batted in]] (RBIs) (2,213), [[bases on balls]] (2,062), [[slugging percentage]] (</span>
				<span class='text'>90), and [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS) (1</span>
				<span class='text'>64); the latter two still stand today</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;99facts&quot; /&gt; Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the first five inductees into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>t age seven, Ruth was sent to [[Cardinal Gibbons School (Baltimore, Maryland)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a reformatory where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]], the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914, Ruth was signed to play [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] baseball for the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] but was soon sold to the Red Sox</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 [[dead-ball era]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Ruth twice [[Win–loss record (pitching)|won]] 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three [[World Series]] championship teams with Boston, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder</span>
				<span class='text'>With regular playing time, he broke the [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|MLB single-season home run record]] in 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>fter that season, Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] controversially sold Ruth to the Yankees, an act that, coupled with Boston's subsequent championship drought, popularized the &quot;[[Curse of the Bambino]]&quot; superstition</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 15 years with New York, Ruth helped the Yankees win seven [[List of American League pennant winners|American League (AL) championships]] and four World Series championships</span>
				<span class='text'>His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in the [[live-ball era]] of baseball, in which it evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of the Yankees' vaunted &quot;[[Murderer's Row]]&quot; lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, extending his MLB single-season record</span>
				<span class='text'>He retired in 1935 after a short stint with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his career, Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season twelve times</span>
				<span class='text'>uth's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure in the &quot;[[Roaring Twenties]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>During his career, he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing</span>
				<span class='text'>His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages</span>
				<span class='text'>He was denied a job in baseball for most of his retirement, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career</span>
				<span class='text'>In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946, he became ill with cancer, and died two years later</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright=1</span>
				<span class='text'>|Babe Ruth birthplace in Baltimore, Maryland]]George Herman Ruth, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> was born in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in [[Pigtown, Baltimore|Pigtown]], a working class section of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, named for its meat-packing plants</span>
				<span class='text'>Its population included recent immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Italy, and African Americans</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>(1871–1918), and Katherine Schamberger, were both of [[German American]] ancestry</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the 1880 census, his parents John and Mary were born in Maryland</span>
				<span class='text'>The paternal grandparents of Ruth, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>were from Prussia and Hanover, respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>had a series of jobs, including [[lightning rod]] salesman and [[streetcar]] operator, before becoming a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon on Frederick Street</span>
				<span class='text'>George Ruth, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> was born in the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smelser pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5–8&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Smelser, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>7–9&lt;/ref&gt;Many aspects of Ruth's childhood are undetermined, including the date of his parents' marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>11&lt;/ref&gt; When young George was a toddler, the family moved to 339 South Goodyear Street, not far from the rail yards; by the time the boy was six, his father had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street</span>
				<span class='text'>Details are equally scanty about why young George was sent at the age of seven to [[Cardinal Gibbons School (Baltimore, Maryland)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a reformatory and orphanage</span>
				<span class='text'>As an adult, Babe Ruth suggested that not only had he been running the streets and rarely attending school, he was drinking beer when his father was not looking</span>
				<span class='text'>Some accounts say that, after a violent incident at his father's saloon, the city authorities decided this environment was unsuitable for a small child</span>
				<span class='text'>At St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's, which George Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>entered on June 13, 1902, he was recorded as &quot;incorrigible&quot;; he spent much of the next twelve years there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>29–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>8–11&lt;/ref&gt;Although St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's inmates received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate the school, particularly once the boys turned 12</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth became a shirtmaker, and was also proficient as a carpenter</span>
				<span class='text'>He would adjust his own shirt collars, rather than having a tailor do it, even during his well-paid baseball career</span>
				<span class='text'>The boys, aged 5 to 21, did most work around the facility, from cooking to shoemaking, and renovated St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's in 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>The food was simple, and the [[Xaverian Brothers]] who ran the school insisted on strict discipline; corporal punishment was common</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth's nickname there was &quot;Niggerlips&quot;, as he had large facial features and was darker than most boys at the all-white reformatory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>19–23&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Babe Ruth - St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's Industrial School</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|left|Ruth (top row, center) at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's Industrial School for Boys in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1912]]Ruth was sometimes allowed to rejoin his family, or was placed at St</span>
				<span class='text'>James's Home, a supervised residence with work in the community, but he was always returned to St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>14&lt;/ref&gt; He rarely was visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's only to attend the funeral</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>32&lt;/ref&gt; How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long [[hit (baseball)|hits]] while playing [[stickball|street ball]]; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a [[catcher]] even though left-handers rarely play that position</span>
				<span class='text'>During his time there he also played [[third base]] and [[shortstop]], again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers</span>
				<span class='text'>He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia</span>
				<span class='text'>A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness</span>
				<span class='text'>For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>35–37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth stated, &quot;I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;c37&quot;&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37&lt;/ref&gt; The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer [[Robert W</span>
				<span class='text'>Creamer]] commented on the closeness between the two:{{quote |Ruth revered Brother Matthias&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>which is remarkable, considering that Matthias was in charge of making boys behave and that Ruth was one of the great natural misbehavers of all time</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>George Ruth caught Brother Matthias' attention early, and the calm, considerable attention the big man gave the young hellraiser from the waterfront struck a spark of response in the boy's soul&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[that may have] blunted a few of the more savage teeth in the gross man whom I have heard at least a half-dozen of his baseball contemporaries describe with admiring awe and wonder as &quot;an animal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;c37&quot; /&gt;}}The school's influence remained with Ruth in other ways: a lifelong [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], he would sometimes attend Mass after carousing all night, and he became a well-known member of the [[Knights of Columbus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He would visit orphanages, schools, and hospitals throughout his life, often avoiding publicity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt; He was generous to St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's as he became famous and rich, donating money and his presence at fundraisers, and spending $5,000 to buy Brother Matthias a Cadillac in 1926—subsequently replacing it when it was destroyed in an accident</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, his biographer Leigh Montville suggests that many of the off-the-field excesses of Ruth's career were driven by the deprivations of his time at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>28–29&lt;/ref&gt;Most of the boys at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's played baseball, with organized leagues at different levels of proficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he played all positions at one time or another (including [[infield]] positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a [[pitcher]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better</span>
				<span class='text'>After becoming the best pitcher at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's, in 1913, when Ruth was 18, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams drawn from the community</span>
				<span class='text'>He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long [[home run]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>26–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt;==Professional baseball=====Minor league, Baltimore Orioles===In early 1914, Ruth was signed to a professional baseball contract by [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn]], owner and manager of the [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]], an [[International League]] team</span>
				<span class='text'>The circumstances of Ruth's signing cannot be stated with certainty, with historical fact obscured by stories that cannot all be true</span>
				<span class='text'>By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, [[Mount St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's University|Mount St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's to victory as Dunn watched</span>
				<span class='text'>Others have [[Washington Senators (1901–1960)|Washington Senators]] pitcher [[Joe Engel]], a Mount St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's, including Ruth</span>
				<span class='text'>Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>48–51&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|Ruth long thought his birthday was February 7, 1894</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in fact the birthday of an elder brother of the same name, who died soon after birth</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth learned this when he needed a passport in 1934</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:1914 Babe Ruth baseball card</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baseball card]] depicting Ruth as a [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Oriole]], 1914]]The train journey to spring training in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], in early March was likely Ruth's first outside the Baltimore area</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>20–21&lt;/ref&gt; The rookie ballplayer was the subject of various pranks by the veterans, who were probably also the source of his famous nickname</span>
				<span class='text'>There are various accounts of how Ruth came to be called Babe, but most center on his being referred to as &quot;Dunnie's babe&quot; or a variant</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Babe&quot; was at that time a common nickname in baseball, with perhaps the most famous to that point being [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] pitcher and [[1909 World Series]] hero [[Babe Adams]], who appeared younger than he was</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, p</span>
				<span class='text'>36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt;Babe Ruth's first appearance as a professional ballplayer was in an intersquad game on March 7, 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth played shortstop, and pitched the last two [[Inning (baseball)|inning]]s of a 15–9 victory</span>
				<span class='text'>In his second at bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right, which was reported locally to be longer than a legendary shot hit in Fayetteville by [[Jim Thorpe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>61–62&lt;/ref&gt; His first appearance against a team in [[organized baseball]] was an exhibition against the major-league [[Philadelphia Phillies]]: Ruth pitched the middle three innings, giving up two runs in the fourth, but then settling down and pitching a scoreless fifth and sixth</span>
				<span class='text'>The following afternoon, Ruth was put in during the sixth inning against the Phillies and did not allow a run the rest of the way</span>
				<span class='text'>The Orioles scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth to overcome a 6–0 deficit, making Ruth the winning pitcher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66–67&lt;/ref&gt;Once the regular season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate</span>
				<span class='text'>The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press</span>
				<span class='text'>A third major league, the [[Federal League]], had begun play, and the local franchise, the [[Baltimore Terrapins]], restored that city to the major leagues for the first time since 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>Few fans visited [[Oriole Park]], where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>72–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>38–40&lt;/ref&gt;The competition from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses</span>
				<span class='text'>Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150</span>
				<span class='text'>Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to [[Richmond, Virginia]], as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club</span>
				<span class='text'>These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>78–80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He offered Ruth to the reigning [[World Series]] champions, [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack's]] [[Philadelphia Athletics]], but Mack had his own financial problems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[New York Giants]] expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers [[Ernie Shore]] and [[Ben Egan]], to the [[Boston Red Sox]] of the [[American League]] (AL) on July 4</span>
				<span class='text'>The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>40–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===MLB, Boston Red Sox (1914–19)=======Developing star====Ruth arrived in Boston on July 11, 1914, along with Egan and Shore</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth later told of meeting the woman he would first marry, Helen Woodford, that morning—she was then a 16-year-old waitress at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there</span>
				<span class='text'>Other stories, though, suggest the meeting happened on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game for the Red Sox that afternoon, he won his first game for the Red Sox, 4–3, over the [[Cleveland Naps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He pitched to catcher [[Bill Carrigan]], who was also the Red Sox manager</span>
				<span class='text'>Shore was given a [[Starting pitcher|start]] by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot; /&gt; As a batter, in his major-league debut, Ruth went [[batting average|0-for-2]] against left-hander [[Willie Mitchell (baseball)|Willie Mitchell]], [[Strikeout|striking out]] in his first [[at bat]], before being removed for a [[pinch hitter]] in the seventh inning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>

				<span class='text'>When he was traded, no one took his place as supervisor</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth's new teammates considered him brash, and would have preferred him, as a rookie, to remain quiet and inconspicuous</span>

				<span class='text'>His teammates nicknamed him &quot;the Big Baboon&quot;, a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname &quot;Niggerlips&quot; at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's, detested</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth had received a raise on promotion to the major leagues, and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>27–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>52–55&lt;/ref&gt;Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth to pitch two [[exhibition game]]s in mid-August</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, he was not restored to the pitching rotation</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch</span>
				<span class='text'>There are legends—filmed for the screen in ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]'' (1948)—that the young pitcher had a habit of signaling his intent to throw a [[curveball]] by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed</span>
				<span class='text'>Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all</span>
				<span class='text'>The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>89–90&lt;/ref&gt;On July 30, 1914, Boston owner [[Joseph Lannin]] had purchased the minor-league [[Providence Grays (minor league)|Providence Grays]], members of the International League</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, p</span>
				<span class='text'>44&lt;/ref&gt; The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the [[Detroit Tigers]], including star hitter [[Ty Cobb]], and as part of the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers</span>
				<span class='text'>To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays</span>
				<span class='text'>This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner [[Garry Herrmann]] [[Waivers (MLB)|claimed him off waivers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors</span>
				<span class='text'>Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] (league championship)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>92–93&lt;/ref&gt;Ruth joined the Grays on August 18, 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>What was left of the Baltimore Orioles after Dunn's deals had managed to hold on to first place until August 15, after which they continued to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and [[Rochester Red Wings|Rochester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth was deeply impressed by Providence manager [[Bill Donovan|&quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan]], previously a star pitcher with a 25–4 [[Win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]] for Detroit in 1907; in later years, he credited Donovan with teaching him much about pitching</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth was called upon often to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 5 in Toronto, Ruth pitched a one-hit 9–0 victory, and hit his first professional home run, his only one as a minor leaguer, off [[Ellis Johnson (baseball)|Ellis Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, he pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the [[New York Yankees]] on October 2, getting his first major league hit, a [[double (baseball)|double]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth finished the season with a record of 2–1 as a major leaguer and 23–8 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence)</span>
				<span class='text'>Once the season concluded, Ruth married Helen in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimore, where the newlyweds boarded with George Ruth, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'> to avoid possible interference from those at St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary's—both bride and groom were not yet of age&lt;ref name=&quot;99facts&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>99–100&lt;/ref&gt; and Ruth remained on parole from that institution until his 21st birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>103&lt;/ref&gt;Ruth reported to his first major league [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], in March 1915</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who had two stellar left-handed pitchers already: the established stars [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]], who had broken the record for the lowest [[earned run average]] (ERA) in a single season; and [[Ray Collins (baseball)|Ray Collins]], a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season</span>
				<span class='text'>Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good [[relief pitcher|relief]] appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game</span>
				<span class='text'>Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the [[Polo Grounds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in [[right fielder|right field]] off of [[Jack Warhop]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd</span>
				<span class='text'>The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to Babe Ruth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>106&lt;/ref&gt;Carrigan was sufficiently impressed by Ruth's pitching to give him a spot in the starting rotation</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth finished the 1915 season 18–8 as a pitcher; as a hitter, he batted </span>
				<span class='text'>15 and had four home runs</span>
				<span class='text'>The Red Sox won the [[List of American League pennant winners|AL pennant]], but with the pitching staff healthy, Ruth was not called upon to pitch in the [[1915 World Series]] against the Philadelphia Phillies</span>
				<span class='text'>Boston won in five games; Ruth was used as a pinch hitter in Game Five, but [[Ground out (baseball)|grounded out]] against Phillies ace [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>50–52&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his success as a pitcher, Ruth was acquiring a reputation for long home runs; at [[Sportsman's Park]] against the [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis Browns]], a Ruth hit soared over Grand Avenue, breaking the window of a [[Chevrolet]] dealership</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>33&lt;/ref&gt;In 1916, there was attention focused on Ruth for his pitching, as he engaged in repeated pitching duels with the ace of the Washington Senators, [[Walter Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The two met five times during the season, with Ruth winning four and Johnson one (Ruth had a [[Win–loss record (pitching)|no decision]] in Johnson's victory)</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of Ruth's victories were by the score of 1–0, one in a 13-inning game</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the 1–0 [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]] decided without extra innings, AL President [[Ban Johnson]] stated, &quot;That was one of the best ball games I have ever seen</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>56–57&lt;/ref&gt; For the season, Ruth went 23–12, with a 1</span>
				<span class='text'>5 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, p</span>
				<span class='text'>55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until [[Ron Guidry]] tied it in 1978</span>

				<span class='text'>On June 23 at Washington, Ruth made a memorable pitching start</span>
				<span class='text'>When the home plate umpire called the first four pitches as balls, Ruth threw a punch at him, and was ejected from the game and later suspended for ten days</span>
				<span class='text'>Ernie Shore was called in to relieve Ruth, and was allowed eight warm-up pitches</span>
				<span class='text'>The runner who had reached base on the [[base on balls|walk]] was [[caught stealing]], and Shore retired all 26 batters he faced to win the game</span>

				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Ruth was used little as a batter, other than his [[plate appearance]]s while pitching, and hit </span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Ruth in 1918, his penultimate year with the Red Sox]]The entry of the United States into World War I occurred at the start of the season, and overshadowed the sport</span>
				<span class='text'>Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age</span>
				<span class='text'>This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season</span>
				<span class='text'>Frazee hired International League President [[Ed Barrow]] as Red Sox manager</span>
				<span class='text'>Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally</span>
				<span class='text'>With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;m67plus&quot; /&gt;Ruth also noticed these vacancies in the lineup, and, dissatisfied in the role of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days, wanted to play every day at another position</span>
				<span class='text'>Barrow tried Ruth at [[first baseman|first base]] and in the [[outfield]] during the exhibition season, but as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener, restricted him to pitching</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball; allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;m67plus&quot; /&gt;Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player [[Harry Hooper]] advise him on baseball game strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position when he was not pitching,&lt;ref name=&quot;m67plus&quot; /&gt; arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c153&quot;&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>153&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;m67plus&quot;&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>67–69&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was allowed a place in the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]] higher than ninth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c153&quot; /&gt;Although Barrow predicted that Ruth would beg to return to pitching the first time he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur</span>
				<span class='text'>Barrow used Ruth primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth hit </span>
				<span class='text'>00, with 11 home runs, enough to secure him a share of the [[List of Major League Baseball home run champions|major league home run title]] with [[Tillie Walker]] of the Philadelphia Athletics</span>
				<span class='text'>He was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13–7 record with a 2</span>
				<span class='text'>2 ERA</span>

				<span class='text'>153–170&lt;/ref&gt;The Red Sox won their third pennant in four years, and faced the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[1918 World Series]], beginning on September 5, the earliest in history</span>
				<span class='text'>The season was shortened as the government had ruled that baseball players eligible for the military would have to be inducted or work in critical war industries, such as armaments plants</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth pitched Game One for the Red Sox, a 1–0 shutout</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Game Four, Ruth injured his left hand in a fight; he pitched anyway</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave up seven hits and six walks, but was helped by outstanding fielding behind him and by his own batting efforts, as a fourth-inning [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] by Ruth gave his team a 2–0 lead</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cubs tied the game in the eighth inning, but the Red Sox scored to take a 3–2 again in the bottom of that inning</span>
				<span class='text'>After Ruth gave up a hit and a walk to start the ninth inning, he was relieved on the mound by [[Bullet Joe Bush|Joe Bush]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To keep Ruth and his bat in the game, he was sent to play [[left fielder|left field]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bush retired the side to give Ruth his second win of the Series, and the third and last World Series pitching victory of his career, against no defeats, in three pitching appearances</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth's effort gave his team a three-games-to-one lead, and two days later the Red Sox won their third Series in four years, four games to two</span>
				<span class='text'>Before allowing the Cubs to score in Game Four, Ruth pitched {{frac|29|2|3}} consecutive scoreless innings, a record for the World Series that stood for more than 40 years until 1961, broken by [[Whitey Ford]] after Ruth's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth was prouder of that record than he was of any of his batting feats</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Ruth in 1919]]With the World Series over, Ruth gained exemption from the war draft by accepting a nominal position with a Pennsylvania steel mill</span>
				<span class='text'>Many industrial establishments took pride in their baseball teams and sought to hire major leaguers</span>
				<span class='text'>The end of the war in November set Ruth free to play baseball without such contrivances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>78–80&lt;/ref&gt;During the 1919 season, Ruth pitched in only 17 of his 130 games,&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot; /&gt; compiling an 8–5 record as Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the season, when the Red Sox manager still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant</span>
				<span class='text'>By late June, the Red Sox were clearly out of the race, and Barrow had no objection to Ruth concentrating on his hitting, if only because it drew people to the ballpark</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth had hit a home run against the Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed</span>
				<span class='text'>Relieved of his pitching duties, Ruth began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave him widespread public and press attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Even his failures were seen as majestic—one sportswriter noted, &quot;When Ruth misses a swipe at the ball, the stands quiver&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>196–197&lt;/ref&gt;Two home runs by Ruth on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by [[Socks Seybold|Ralph &quot;Socks&quot; Seybold]] in 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth matched that on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|major league record]] of 24, set by [[Buck Freeman]] in 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth reached this on September 8, by which time, writers had discovered that [[Ned Williamson]] of the 1884 [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]] had hit 27—though in a ballpark where the distance to right field was only {{convert|215|ft}}</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 20, &quot;Babe Ruth Day&quot; at Fenway Park, Ruth won the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying Williamson</span>
				<span class='text'>He broke the record four days later against the Yankees at the Polo Grounds, and hit one more against the Senators to finish with 29</span>
				<span class='text'>The home run at Washington made Ruth the first major league player to hit a home run at all eight ballparks in his league</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of Ruth's hitting heroics, the Red Sox finished sixth, {{frac|20|1|2}} games behind the league champion White Sox</span>

				<span class='text'>203&lt;/ref&gt;===Sale to New York===As an out-of-towner from New York City, Frazee had been regarded with suspicion by Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans when he bought the team</span>
				<span class='text'>He won them over with success on the field and a willingness to build the Red Sox by purchasing or trading for players</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered the Senators $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner [[Clark Griffith]] was unwilling</span>
				<span class='text'>Even so, Frazee was successful in bringing other players to Boston, especially as replacements for players in the military</span>
				<span class='text'>This willingness to spend for players helped the Red Sox secure the 1918 title</span>

				<span class='text'>4–5&lt;/ref&gt; The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Ruth's home runs for Boston made him a national sensation</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>204–205&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Babe Ruth by Paul Thompson, 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Ruth as a Yankee in 1920]]Not all of the circumstances concerning the sale are known, but brewer and former congressman [[Jacob Ruppert]], the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager [[Miller Huggins]] what the team needed to be successful</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Get Ruth from Boston&quot;, Huggins supposedly replied, noting that Frazee was perennially in need of money to finance his theatrical productions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–3&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, there was precedent for the Ruth transaction: when Boston pitcher [[Carl Mays]] left the Red Sox in a 1919 dispute, Frazee had settled the matter by selling Mays to the Yankees, though over the opposition of AL President Johnson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt;According to one of Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, &quot;why Frazee needed cash in 1919—and large infusions of it quickly—is still, more than 80 years later, a bit of a mystery&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;r5&quot; /&gt; The often-told story is that Frazee needed money to finance the musical ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security</span>
				<span class='text'>That play did not open until 1925, however, by which time Frazee had sold the Red Sox</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c20&quot; /&gt; Still, the story may be true in essence: ''No, No, Nanette'' was based on a Frazee-produced play, ''My Lady Friends'', which opened in 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>101–102&lt;/ref&gt;There were other financial pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth, fully aware of baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c20&quot;&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>20&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stout, p</span>
				<span class='text'>83&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;r5&quot;&gt;Reisler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston|Tillinghast Huston]], were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>205–207&lt;/ref&gt;Frazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player</span>
				<span class='text'>The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park</span>
				<span class='text'>Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain</span>

				<span class='text'>]The home runs kept coming; Ruth tied his own record of 29 on July 15, and broke it with home runs in both games of a doubleheader four days later</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of July, he had 37, but his pace slackened somewhat after that</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>226&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on September 4, he both tied and broke the organized baseball record for home runs in a season, snapping [[Perry Werden]]'s 1895 mark of 44 in the minor [[Western League (original)|Western League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75&lt;/ref&gt; The Yankees played well as a team, battling for the league lead early in the summer, but slumped in August in the AL pennant battle with Chicago and Cleveland</span>
				<span class='text'>The championship was won by Cleveland, surging ahead after the [[Black Sox Scandal]] broke on September 28 and led to the suspension of many of the team's top players, including Joe Jackson</span>
				<span class='text'>The Yankees finished third, but drew 1</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million fans to the Polo Grounds, the first time a team had drawn a seven figure attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest of the league sold 600,000 more tickets, many fans there to see Ruth, who led the league with 54 home runs, 158 [[Run (baseball)|runs]], and 137 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stout, p</span>
				<span class='text'>92&lt;/ref&gt;Ruth was aided in his exploits, in 1920 and afterwards, by the fact that the A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Reach Company, maker of baseballs used in the major leagues, was using a more efficient machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>When these went into play in 1920, the start of the [[live-ball era]], the number of home runs increased by 184 over the previous year across the major leagues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>100–101&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball statistician [[Bill James]] points out that while Ruth was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the [[spitball]] (accelerated after the death of [[Ray Chapman]], struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to Chapman's death)</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, James theorizes that Ruth's 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had Ruth refrained from pitching 133 innings that season, and if he were playing with any other home field but Fenway Park, where he hit only 9 of 29 home runs</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Montvillepp&quot; /&gt;During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth circled the world with his wife, including a barnstorming tour of the Far East</span>
				<span class='text'>At his final stop before returning home, in the United Kingdom, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player [[Alan Fairfax]], and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field&lt;!-- American lingo, we know it's a ground --&gt;, destroying the bat in the process</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Fairfax regretted that he could not have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week</span>

				<span class='text'>336</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Also during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take Ruth as a manager and/or a player</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Neyer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While the barnstorming tour was under way, Ruppert began negotiating with Boston Braves owner Judge [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]], who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing fourth in the National League in both 1933 and 1934, the team performed poorly at the box office</span>
				<span class='text'>Unable to afford the rent at [[Braves Field]], Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis</span>
				<span class='text'>After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruppert had stated that he would not release Ruth to go to another team as a full-time player</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper [[Bill McKechnie]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruppert called the deal &quot;the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;There was considerable attention as Ruth reported for spring training</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not hit his first home run of the spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah</span>
				<span class='text'>He hit two in an exhibition against the Bears</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, p</span>
				<span class='text'>339</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years</span>
				<span class='text'>Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted for all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth</span>
				<span class='text'>Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch in left field which sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>393</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Ruth had two hits in the second game of the season, but it quickly went downhill both for him and the Braves from there</span>
				<span class='text'>The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves losing most games</span>
				<span class='text'>As April passed into May, Ruth's deterioration became even more pronounced</span>
				<span class='text'>While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else</span>
				<span class='text'>His condition had deteriorated to the point that he could barely trot around the bases</span>
				<span class='text'>His fielding had become so poor that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup</span>
				<span class='text'>Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well</span>
				<span class='text'>He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Neyer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>43–45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline</span>

				<span class='text'>He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, p</span>
				<span class='text'>340</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;neyer44&quot;&gt;Neyer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>388–390</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the end of the first month of the season, Ruth concluded he was finished even as a part-time player</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;neyer44&quot;/&gt; Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the [[Memorial Day]] doubleheader in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him</span>
				<span class='text'>In Chicago and St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to </span>
				<span class='text'>55, with only three home runs</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by [[Paul Waner]] probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides [[Forbes Field]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>395–397&lt;/ref&gt;Ruth played in the third game of the Pittsburgh series on May 25, 1935, and added one more tale to his playing legend</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth went 4-for-4, including three home runs, though the Braves lost the game 11–7</span>
				<span class='text'>The last two were off Ruth's old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush</span>
				<span class='text'>The final home run, both of the game and of Ruth's career, sailed over the upper deck in right field and out of the ballpark, the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Forbes Field</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth was urged to make this his last game, but he had given his word to Fuchs and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia—the Braves lost both—was his final major league appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 2, after an argument with Fuchs, Ruth retired</span>
				<span class='text'>He finished 1935 with a </span>
				<span class='text'>81 average—easily his worst as a full-time position player—and the final six of his 714 home runs</span>
				<span class='text'>The Braves, 10–27 when Ruth left, finished 38–115, at </span>
				<span class='text'>48 the worst winning percentage in modern National League history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>396–400&lt;/ref&gt; Insolvent like his team, Fuchs gave up control of the Braves before the end of the season; the National League took over the franchise at the end of the year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, p</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Ruth with [[Gary Cooper]] in the 1942 film ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'']]Although Fuchs had given Ruth his unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring him in any capacity</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement and the end of the 1937 season</span>
				<span class='text'>Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner [[Alva Bradley]] replied negatively</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;c399a&quot; /&gt;The writer Creamer believed Ruth was unfairly treated in never being given an opportunity to manage a major league club</span>
				<span class='text'>The author believed there was not necessarily a relationship between personal conduct and managerial success, noting that [[John McGraw (baseball)|McGraw]], [[Billy Martin]], and [[Bobby Valentine]] were winners despite character flaws</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sherman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; Team owners and general managers assessed Ruth's flamboyant personal habits as a reason to exclude him from a managerial job; Barrow said of him, &quot;How can he manage other men when he can't even manage himself?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;99facts&quot; /&gt;Ruth played much golf and in a few exhibition baseball games, demonstrating a continuing ability to draw large crowds</span>
				<span class='text'>This appeal contributed to the Dodgers' hiring him as first base coach in 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>But Brooklyn general manager [[Larry MacPhail]] made it clear when Ruth was hired that he would not be considered for the manager's job if, as expected, [[Burleigh Grimes]] retired at the end of the season</span>
				<span class='text'>Although much was said about what Ruth could teach the younger players, in practice, his duties were to appear on the field in uniform and encourage base runners—he was not called upon to relay signs</span>
				<span class='text'>He got along well with everyone except team captain [[Leo Durocher]], who was hired as Grimes' replacement at season's end</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth returned to retirement, never again to work in baseball</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;c399a&quot;&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>399–405</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On July 4, 1939, Ruth spoke on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium as members of the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, forced into premature retirement by [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS disease]], which would kill him in two years</span>
				<span class='text'>The next week, Ruth went to [[Cooperstown, New York]], for the formal opening of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Three years earlier he was one of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first five players]] elected to it</span>
				<span class='text'>As radio broadcasts of baseball became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>247–249</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army–Navy Relief Fund</span>
				<span class='text'>He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball, contacting new Yankees boss MacPhail, but was sent a rejection letter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>355–356</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Cancer and death (1946–48)===As early as the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to take better care of his health, and he grudgingly followed their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>252–253</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye, and had difficulty swallowing</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1946, he entered French Hospital in New York for tests, which revealed Ruth had an inoperable [[cancer|malignant tumor]] at the base of his skull and in his neck</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a lesion known as [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], or &quot;lymphoepithelioma</span>

				<span class='text'>He returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started</span>
				<span class='text'>The new commissioner, [[Happy Chandler]] (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be in the Bronx</span>

				<span class='text'>418–419</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around this time, developments in [[chemotherapy]] offered some hope</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctors had not told Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;montville360&quot; /&gt; Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name</span>
				<span class='text'>He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on [[American Legion Baseball]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In and out of the hospital in New York, he left for Florida in February 1948, doing what activities he could</span>
				<span class='text'>After six weeks he returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party</span>

				<span class='text'>By this time he had lost much weight and had difficulty walking</span>
				<span class='text'>Introduced along with his surviving teammates from 1923, Ruth used a bat as a cane</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Nat Fein]]'s photo of Ruth taken from behind, standing near home plate and facing &quot;Ruthville&quot; (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs, and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]]</span>

				<span class='text'>267–268</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Ruth made one final trip on behalf of American Legion Baseball, then entered [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Hospital]], where he would die</span>
				<span class='text'>He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it</span>
				<span class='text'>He was able to leave the hospital for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time</span>
				<span class='text'>He was barely able to speak</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth's condition gradually became worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was [[National League]] president and future [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Ford Frick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable</span>
				<span class='text'>He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard&quot;, Frick said years later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Creamer, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>423–424&lt;/ref&gt;Thousands of New Yorkers, including many children, stood vigil outside the hospital in Ruth's final days</span>
				<span class='text'>On August 16, 1948, at 8:01&amp;nbsp;pm, Ruth died in his sleep at the age of 53</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of a wake at a funeral home, his casket was taken to Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute</span>
				<span class='text'>His funeral Mass took place at [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick's Cathedral (New York)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Patrick's Cathedral]]; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside</span>

				<span class='text'>Sometime in 1932, Gehrig's mother, during a conversation which she assumed was private, remarked, &quot;It's a shame [Claire] doesn't dress Dorothy as nicely as she dresses her own daughter</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;Creamer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wagenheim stated, &quot;He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Glenn Stout, &quot;Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for</span>
				<span class='text'>A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;st86&quot; /&gt;Ruth's penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]], and the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Advocates of what was dubbed &quot;inside baseball&quot;, such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on the purity of the game</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to sportswriter W</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Phelon after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, &quot;settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching</span>
				<span class='text'>Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reisler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>236</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bill James noted, &quot;When the owners discovered that the fans ''liked'' to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace [in the Black Sox Scandal], then there was no turning back</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;James, p</span>
				<span class='text'>122&lt;/ref&gt; While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>237–239</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to contemporary sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]], only two sports figures of the 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer [[Jack Dempsey]] and racehorse [[Man o' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reisler, p</span>
				<span class='text'>200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors that contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better than anyone else in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Montville notes that &quot;the fog [surrounding his childhood] will make him forever accessible, universal</span>
				<span class='text'>He will be the patron saint of American possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13–14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fact that Ruth played when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play, in the era before television coverage of baseball, allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Reisler notes that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Barry Bonds]], generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s; Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch</span>

				<span class='text'>At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974, timed to capitalize on the increase in public interest in Ruth as [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]] approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Montville, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Aaron stated as he approached Ruth's record, &quot;I can't remember a day this year or last when I did not hear the name of Babe Ruth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;c16&quot; /&gt;Montville suggests that Ruth is probably even more popular today than he was when his career home run record was broken by Aaron</span>
				<span class='text'>The longball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, to the delight of the fans</span>
				<span class='text'>Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on ''[[SportsCenter]]'' and ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' each evening during the season</span>
				<span class='text'>The questions of [[performance-enhancing drug]] use, which have dogged recent home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time</span>
