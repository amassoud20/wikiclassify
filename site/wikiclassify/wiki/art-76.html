				<span class='text'>Although Ruth twice  23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three  championship teams with Boston he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder</span>

				<span class='text'>fter that season Red Sox owner  controversially sold Ruth to the Yankees an act that coupled with Bostons subsequent championship drought popularized the  superstition</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 15 years with New York Ruth helped the Yankees win seven  and four World Series championships</span>
				<span class='text'>His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sports popularity but also helped usher in the  of baseball in which it evolved from a low scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor</span>

				<span class='text'>During his career he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off field penchants for drinking and womanizing</span>
				<span class='text'>His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages</span>
				<span class='text'>He was denied a job in baseball for most of his retirement most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career</span>
				<span class='text'>In his final years Ruth made many public appearances especially in support of American efforts in World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1946 he became ill with cancer and died two years later</span>

				<span class='text'>Details are equally scanty about why young George was sent at the age of seven to  a ormatory and orphanage</span>
				<span class='text'>As an adult Babe Ruth suggested that not only had he been running the streets and rarely attending school he was drinking beer when his father was not looking</span>

				<span class='text'>Ruth became a shirtmaker and was also proficient as a carpenter</span>
				<span class='text'>He would adjust his own shirt collars rather than having a tailor do it even during his well paid baseball career</span>

				<span class='text'>reamer p</span>
				<span class='text'>32  How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain according to one account his placement at St</span>

				<span class='text'>A large man Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness</span>

				<span class='text'>There are various accounts of how Ruth came to be called Babe but most center on his being erred to as Dunnies babe or a variant</span>
				<span class='text'>Babe was at that time a common nickname in baseball with perhaps the most famous to that point being  pitcher and  hero  who appeared younger than he was</span>

				<span class='text'>The following afternoon Ruth was put in during the sixth inning against the Phillies and did not allow a run the rest of the way</span>
				<span class='text'>The Orioles scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth to overcome a 6–0 deficit making Ruth the winning pitcher</span>

				<span class='text'>66–67 Once the regular season began Ruth was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate</span>

				<span class='text'>Few fans visited  where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date a Terrapins official denied it stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn</span>

				<span class='text'>72–77 Montville pp</span>
				<span class='text'>38–40 The competition from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses</span>
				<span class='text'>Although by late June the Orioles were in first place having won over two thirds of their games the paid attendance dropped as low as 150</span>
				<span class='text'>Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to  as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club</span>
				<span class='text'>These possibilities fell through leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money</span>

				<span class='text'>The sale price was announced as 25000 but other reports lower the amount to half that or possibly 8500 plus the cancellation of a 3000 loan</span>

				<span class='text'> Ruth arrived in Boston on July 11 1914 along with Egan and Shore</span>

				<span class='text'>There are legends—filmed for the screen in  1948—that the young pitcher had a habit of signaling his intent to throw a  by sticking out his tongue slightly and that he was easy to hit until this changed</span>
				<span class='text'>Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all</span>
				<span class='text'>The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie</span>

				<span class='text'>name History Contemporary impactRuth was the first baseball star to be the subject of overwhelming interest by the public</span>
				<span class='text'>Baseball had developed star players before such as Cobb and Shoeless Joe Jackson but both men had uneasy relations with fans in Cobbs case sometimes marked by violence</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruths biographers agree that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to Home Run King with an America hit hard by both the war and the  longing for something to help put these traumas behind it</span>
				<span class='text'>He also resonated in a country which felt in the aftermath of the war that it took second place to no one</span>
				<span class='text'>Montville argues that as a larger than life figure capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nations largest city Ruth became an icon of the significant social changes which marked the early 1920s</span>

				<span class='text'>name   st86Stout p</span>
				<span class='text'>86 Ruth became such a symbol of the United States during his lifetime that during World War II Japanese soldiers yelled in English To hell with Babe Ruth to anger American soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth replied that he hoped that every Jap that mentioned my name gets shot</span>

				<span class='text'> According to Glenn Stout Ruths home runs were exalted uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for</span>
				<span class='text'>A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself one that meant anything was possible</span>
				<span class='text'>name   st86  Ruths penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to 1920 home runs were unusual and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base the  and the </span>
				<span class='text'>Advocates of what was dubbed inside baseball such as Giants manager McGraw disliked the home run considering it a blot on the purity of the game</span>
				<span class='text'>eisler p</span>
				<span class='text'>18</span>
				<span class='text'> According to sportswriter W</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Phelon after the 1920 season Ruths breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance settled for all time to come that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching</span>
				<span class='text'>Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth exponent of the home run and overshadowing star</span>
				<span class='text'>eisler p</span>
				<span class='text'>236</span>
				<span class='text'> Bill James noted When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace in the Black Sox Scandal then there was no turning back</span>
				<span class='text'>ames p</span>
				<span class='text'>122  While a few such as McGraw and Cobb decried the passing of the old style play teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers</span>
				<span class='text'>eisler pp</span>
				<span class='text'>237–239</span>
				<span class='text'>According to contemporary sportswriter  only two sports figures of the 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer  and racehorse </span>
				<span class='text'>eisler p</span>
				<span class='text'>200</span>
				<span class='text'> One of the factors that contributed to Ruths broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story that even an uneducated unsophisticated youth without any family wealth or connections can do something better than anyone else in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Montville notes that the fog surrounding his childhood will make him forever accessible universal</span>
				<span class='text'>He will be the patron saint of American possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>ontville pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13–14</span>
				<span class='text'> Similarly the fact that Ruth played when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play in the era before television coverage of baseball allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters</span>
				<span class='text'>agenheim pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6–7</span>
				<span class='text'> Reisler notes that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruths 60 home run mark such as  and  generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single season home run record in the 1920s Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch</span>
				<span class='text'>eisler p</span>
				<span class='text'>xv</span>
				<span class='text'>LegacyCreamer termed Ruth a unique figure in the social history of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>name c16   Ruth has even entered the language a dominant figure in a field whether within or outside sports is often erred to as the Babe Ruth of that field</span>
				<span class='text'>name c16   Similarly Ruthian has come to mean in sports colossal dramatic prodigious magnificent with great power</span>
				<span class='text'>More books Montville noted in 2006 have been written about Ruth than about any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame</span>
				<span class='text'>At least five of these books including Creamers and Wagenheims were written in 1973 and 1974 timed to capitalize on the increase in public interest in Ruth as  approached his career home run mark which he broke on April 8 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>ontville pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1–6</span>
				<span class='text'> Aaron stated as he approached Ruths record I cant remember a day this year or last when I did not hear the name of Babe Ruth</span>
				<span class='text'>name c16  Montville suggests that Ruth is probably even more popular today than he was when his career home run record was broken by Aaron</span>
				<span class='text'>The longball era that Ruth started continues in baseball to the delight of the fans</span>
				<span class='text'>Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs which are featured on  and  each evening during the season</span>
				<span class='text'>The questions of  use which have dogged recent home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds do nothing to diminish Ruths reputation his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time</span>
				<span class='text'>ontville pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4–5</span>
				<span class='text'>Ruth has been named the greatest baseball player of all time in various surveys and rankings</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1998  ranked him number one on the list of Baseballs 100 Greatest Players</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1999 baseball fans named Ruth to the </span>

				<span class='text'>One long term survivor of the craze over Ruth may be the  candy bar</span>
				<span class='text'>The original company to market the confectionery the Curtis Candy Company maintained that the bar was named after  daughter of former president </span>
				<span class='text'> She died in 1904 and the bar was first marketed in 1921 at the height of the craze over the slugger</span>

				<span class='text'> The slugger later sought to market candy bearing his name he was used a trademark because of the Baby Ruth bar</span>
				<span class='text'>Corporate files from 1921 are no longer extant the brand has changed hands several times and is now owned by the  company</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ruth estate licensed his likeness for use in an advertising campaign for Baby Ruth in 1995</span>
