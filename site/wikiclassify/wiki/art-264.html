				<span class='text'>oyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique he utilized</span>
				<span class='text'>Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters</span>
				<span class='text'>oyce was born in 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]]—about half a mile from his mother's birthplace in [[Terenure]]—into a middle-class family on the way down</span>

				<span class='text'>He went on to attend [[University College Dublin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated permanently to continental Europe with his partner [[Nora Barnacle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They lived in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]], and [[Zurich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'', he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, &quot;For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world</span>

				<span class='text'>Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, which engendered in him a lifelong [[cynophobia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also suffered from [[astraphobia]], as a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms to him as a sign of God's wrath</span>

				<span class='text'> 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion</span>

				<span class='text'>268, 417</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Joyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin</span>
				<span class='text'>He also frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste</span>
				<span class='text'>Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in [[Dublin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence</span>
				<span class='text'>What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Zurich, Joyce met one of his most enduring and important friends, the English [[Socialism|socialist]] painter [[Frank Budgen]], whose opinion Joyce constantly sought through the writing of ''Ulysses'' and ''Finnegans Wake''</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also here that [[Ezra Pound]] brought him to the attention of English feminist and publisher [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], who would become Joyce's patron, providing him with thousands of pounds over the next 25 years and relieving him of the burden of teaching to focus on his writing</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Zurich he wrote ''Exiles'', published ''A Portrait</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', and began serious work on ''Ulysses''</span>
				<span class='text'>Zurich during the war was home to exiles and artists from across Europe, and its bohemian, multilingual atmosphere suited him</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, after four years he was restless, and after the war he returned to Trieste as he had originally planned</span>
				<span class='text'>He found the city had changed, and some of his old friends noted his maturing from teacher to artist</span>
				<span class='text'>His relations with his brother Stanislaus (who had been interned in an Austrian prison camp for most of the war due to his pro-Italian politics) were more strained than ever</span>
				<span class='text'>Joyce went to Paris in 1920 at an invitation from Ezra Pound, supposedly for a week, but the family ended up living there for the next twenty years</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Joyce's poetry and prose became an inspiration for composers and musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>There are at least five aspects to consider:'''1</span>
				<span class='text'>Joyce's musicality:''' Joyce had considerable musical talent, which expressed itself in his singing, piano and guitar playing, as well as in a melody that he composed</span>
				<span class='text'>His own musicality (which once made him consider music as a profession) is the root of his strong adoption of music as a major driving force in his fiction, in addition to his own experience of music in Ireland before he left in 1904</span>
				<span class='text'>Joyce had a light tenor voice; he was taught by [[Vincent O'Brien (composer)|Vincent O'Brien]] and Benedetto Palmieri; in 1904 won a bronze medal at the competitive music festival Feis Ceoil</span>
				<span class='text'>His only composition is a melody to his poem ''Bid adieu'', to which a piano accompaniment was added in the 1920s in Paris by the American composer [[Edmund J</span>
				<span class='text'>Pendleton]] (1899–1987)</span>
				<span class='text'>''2</span>
				<span class='text'>The music Joyce knew:''' Music frequently found its way into Joyce's poetry and prose</span>
				<span class='text'>Often this happens in the form of allusions to (or partial quotations from) texts of Irish traditional songs, popular ballads, Roman Catholic chant and opera arias</span>
				<span class='text'>His operatic references include works by [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]], [[Vincent Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], in addition to [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] (among many others)</span>
				<span class='text'>Joyce also makes frequent use of the ''Irish Melodies'' of [[Thomas Moore]] and ballads such as George Barker's ''Dublin Bay'' and [[James Lynam Molloy|J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Molloy]]'s ''Love's Old Sweet Song''</span>
				<span class='text'>''3</span>
				<span class='text'>Opera as a genre:''' Joyce had a lifelong preoccupation with opera as a generic precedent for his own fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Joyce scholarship has long identified an explicit recourse to musical structures in ''Ulysses'' (in particular the 'Sirens' episode) and ''Finnegans Wake'', more recent criticism has established a decisive reliance on Wagner's ''Ring'' in ''Finnegans Wake''&lt;ref&gt;Timothy P</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin: ''Joyce and Wagner</span>
				<span class='text'>A Study of Influence'' (Cambridge, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and an attempt to adapt the structures of opera and oratorio to the medium of fiction, notably in the 'Cyclops' episode of ''Ulysses''</span>

				<span class='text'>White: ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Antheil]]'s unfinished setting of 'Cyclops' as an opera attests this attempt</span>
				<span class='text'>''4</span>
				<span class='text'>Music to Joyce's words:''' Music that uses Joyce's texts most frequently appears as settings of his poems in songs, and occasionally as excerpts from prose works</span>
				<span class='text'>Irish composers were among the first to set Joyce's poetry, including [[Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer]] (1882–1957), [[Herbert Hughes (composer)|Herbert Hughes]] (1882–1937) and [[Brian Boydell]] (1917–2000),&lt;ref&gt;Axel Klein: &quot;'The Distant Music Mournfully Murmereth': The Influence of James Joyce on Irish Composers&quot;, in: ''Ars Lyrica'' 14 (2004), p</span>
				<span class='text'>71–94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but the musical qualities of Joyce's verse also attracted European and North American composers, with early settings by [[Karol Szymanowski]] (''Songs to Words by James Joyce'' op</span>
				<span class='text'>54, 1926) and [[Samuel Barber]] (''Three Songs'' op</span>
				<span class='text'>10, 1936) in addition to settings by major exponents of the 1950s and '60s avant-garde such as [[Elliot Carter]] (String Quartet No</span>
				<span class='text'>1, 1951) and [[Luciano Berio]] (''Chamber Music'', 1953; ''Thema (Ommagio a Joyce)'', 1958; etc</span>

				<span class='text'>Music inspired by Joyce:''' Often, instrumental music was also inspired by Joyce's writings, including works by [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Klaus Huber]], [[Rebecca Saunders]], [[Toru Takemitsu]] and [[Gerard Victory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With [[Luciano Berio]]'s ''[[Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)]]'' (1958) there is also a key work in the development of electro-acoustic music</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2014 the English composer [[Stephen Crowe (composer)|Stephen Crowe]] set Joyce's explicit letters to Nora as a song-cycle for tenor and ensemble</span>

				<span class='text'>A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition</span>
				<span class='text'>oyce also published a number of books of poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>His first mature published work was the satirical broadside &quot;The Holy Office&quot; (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic Revival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first full-length poetry collection ''[[Chamber Music (book)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907) (referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot) consisted of 36 short lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes &quot;Gas From A Burner&quot; (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927) and &quot;Ecce Puer&quot; (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father)</span>

				<span class='text'>]As he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>The writing was completed in October 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922)</span>

				<span class='text'>251–62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although the conviction was based on the &quot;Nausicaä&quot; episode of ''Ulysses'', ''The Little Review'' had fuelled the fires of controversy with [[dada]] poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'s defence of ''Ulysses'' in an essay &quot;The Modest Woman</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Partly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Rive Gauche]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of &quot;bootleg&quot; versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Bloom and Dedalus represent Joyce in difference ages: youth and middle age</span>
				<span class='text'> And both relate to each other symbolically in the novel as father and son</span>
				<span class='text'>The key to this father/son relationship is revealed by Stephen on the Sandymount strand when he contemplates the Nicene Creed and the 'consubstantial' relationship of God the Father to Son</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen&quot;&gt;Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of [[Thom's Directory]]—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[classical mythology]] as an organising framework, the near-obsessive focus on external detail, and the occurrence of significant action within the minds of characters have also contributed to the development of literary modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, &quot;I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',&quot; and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form</span>
				<span class='text'> It was only when [[Stuart Gilbert]] published his critical work on ''Ulysses'' in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably</span>
				<span class='text'>This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] and his own health problems, including failing eyesight</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1982), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>591–592</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Reaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, [[Stanislaus Joyce]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1982), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>577–85</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M</span>
				<span class='text'>Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work</span>
				<span class='text'>In his book, ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as &quot;a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-452-25341-1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''Finnegans Wake'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure language, based mainly on complex multi-level puns</span>
				<span class='text'>This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his &quot;usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Finnegans Wake'', 179</span>
				<span class='text'>6–27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Wake'' itself</span>
				<span class='text'>However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot</span>
				<span class='text'>uch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages</span>
				<span class='text'>The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gluck, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the &quot;characters</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos</span>
				<span class='text'>The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs</span>
