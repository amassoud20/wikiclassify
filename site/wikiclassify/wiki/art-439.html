				<span class='text'>gg}}; 13 June 1897 – 2 October 1973) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[middle-distance running|middle-]] and [[long-distance running|long-distance runner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was nicknamed the &quot;[[Flying Finn]]&quot; as he dominated distance running in the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Nurmi set 22 official [[List of world records in athletics|world records]] at distances between [[1500 metres]] and 20&amp;nbsp;kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the [[Olympic Games]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated at distances from [[800 m]] upwards for 121 races</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the [[10,000 m]]</span>
				<span class='text'>orn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at 12 to provide for his family</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of [[Hannes Kolehmainen]] and began developing a strict training program</span>
				<span class='text'>Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting [[Finnish records in athletics|national records]] en route to his international debut at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a silver medal in the [[5000 m]], he took gold in the 10,000 m and the [[cross country running|cross country]] events</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the [[mile run|mile]], the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals (the first athlete to ever do so at a single Olympics),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paavo Nurmi|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>truggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals [[Ville Ritola]] and [[Edvin Wide]] ever more serious challengers</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the [[3000 m steeplechase]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the [[one hour run]] and the 25-mile marathon</span>
				<span class='text'>Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done</span>
				<span class='text'>In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-[[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status</span>
				<span class='text'>Two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running</span>
				<span class='text'>urmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the [[Winter War]], and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and share trader, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952, he was the [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lighter of the Olympic Flame]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki</span>
				<span class='text'>Nurmi's speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the &quot;Phantom Finn&quot;, while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle and long distance runners</span>
				<span class='text'>Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the &quot;even pace&quot; strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SLU&quot;/&gt; As the unit commander [[Hugo Österman]] was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice</span>
