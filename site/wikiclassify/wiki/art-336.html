				<span class='text'>He graduated as Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1928 and became an assistant professor at the Institute of Anatomy until 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>He finished his zoological studies in 1933 and received his second doctorate (PhD)</span>

				<span class='text'>One result of these studies was that Lorenz &quot;realized that an overpowering increase in the drives of feeding as well as of copulation and a waning of more differentiated social instincts is characteristic of very many domestic animals&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Lorenz began to suspect and fear &quot;that analogous processes of deterioration may be at work with civilized humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This observation of bird hybrids caused Lorenz to believe that interbreeding between different [[Race (classification of humans)|human races]] might also cause [[dysgenic]] effects, and that the [[Nazi eugenics]] policies against &quot;race mixing&quot; were therefore scientifically justified</span>

				<span class='text'>He is best known for his discovery of the principle of attachment, or imprinting, through which in some species a bond is formed between a new born animal and its caregiver</span>
				<span class='text'>This principle had been discovered by [[Douglas Spalding]] in the 19th century, and Lorenz's mentor Oskar Heinroth had also worked on the topic, but Lorenz's description of ''Prägung'', imprinting, in [[nidifugous]] birds such as greylag geese in his 1935 book ''Der Kumpan in der Umwelt des Vogels'' (&quot;The Companion in the Environment of Birds&quot;) became the foundational description of the phenomenon</span>

				<span class='text'>University of Chicago Press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Here, Lorenz used [[Jakob von Uexküll]]'s concept of [[Umwelt]] to understand how the limited perception of animals filtered out certain phenomena with which they interacted instinctively</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, a young goose instinctively bonds with the first moving stimulus it perceives, whether it be its mother, a person or an inanimate object</span>
				<span class='text'>Lorenz showed that this behavior of imprinting is what allows the goose to learn to recognize members of its own species, enabling them to be the object of subsequent behavior patterns such as mating</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=species/&gt; He developed a theory of instinctive behavior that saw behavior patterns as largely innate but triggered through environmental stimuli</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that animals have an inner drive to carry out instinctive behaviors, and that if they do not encounter the right stimulus they will eventually engage in the behavior with an inappropriate stimulus</span>

				<span class='text'>183-4&lt;/ref&gt;Lorenz's approach to ethology derived from a skepticism towards the studies of animal behavior done in laboratory settings</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered that in order to understand the mechanisms of animal behavior, it was necessary to observe their full range of behaviors in their natural context</span>
				<span class='text'>Lorenz did not carry out much traditional fieldwork but observed animals near his home</span>
				<span class='text'>His method involved empathizing with animals, often using anthropomorphization to imagine their mental states</span>

				<span class='text'>They experimented with &quot;[[Supernormal stimulus|supernormal stimuli]]&quot; such as giant eggs or dummy bird beaks which they found could release the fixed action patterns more powerfully than the natural objects for which the behaviors were adapted</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by the ideas of [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], Lorenz developed this into a &quot;psychohydraulic&quot; model of the [[motivation]] of behavior, which tended towards [[group selection]]ist ideas, which were influential in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Another of his contributions to ethology  is his work on [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence on a younger generation of [[ethologists]]; and his popular works, were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public</span>
				<span class='text'>orenz claimed that there was widespread contempt for the descriptive sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>He attributed this to the denial of perception as the source of all scientific knowledge: &quot;a denial that has been evaluated to the status of religion</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;There are three Konrad Lorenz Institutes in Austria; one is housed in his family mansion at Altenberg [http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>li</span>
				<span class='text'>c</span>
				<span class='text'>t/], and another at his field station in Grünau</span>
				<span class='text'>orenz, like other ethologists, performed research largely by observation, or when experiments were conducted, they were conducted in a natural setting</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Animal welfare]] advocates like to point out that Lorenz won a Nobel Prize without ever using [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>==Lorenz's vision of the challenges facing humanity===Lorenz also predicted the relationship between market economics and the threat of ecological catastrophe</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 1973 book, ''Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins'', Konrad Lorenz addresses the following paradox::&quot;All the advantages that man has gained from his ever-deepening understanding of the natural world that surrounds him, his technological, chemical and medical progress, all of which should seem to alleviate human suffering</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>tends instead to favor humanity's destruction&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gli otto peccati capitali della nostra civiltà |trans_title=Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins |publisher=[[Adelphi Edizioni]] |location=Milano |year=1974 |page=26 }} The citation is translated from the Italian version of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Lorenz adopts an ecological model to attempt to grasp the mechanisms behind this contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus &quot;all species</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>are adapted to their environment</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>including not only inorganic components</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>but all the other living beings that inhabit the locality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; p31</span>
				<span class='text'>undamental to Lorenz's theory of ecology is the function of [[feedback]] mechanisms, especially [[Negative feedback|negative ones]] which, in hierarchical fashion, dampen impulses that occur beneath a certain threshold</span>
				<span class='text'>The thresholds themselves are the product of the interaction of contrasting mechanisms</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus pain and pleasure act as checks on each other::&quot;To gain a desired prey, a dog or wolf will do things that, in other contexts, they would shy away from: run through thorn bushes, jump into cold water and expose themselves to risks which would normally frighten them</span>
				<span class='text'>All these inhibitory mechanisms</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>act as a counterweight to the effects of learning mechanisms</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The organism cannot allow itself to pay a price which is not worth paying&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>p53</span>
				<span class='text'>n nature, these mechanisms tend towards a 'stable state' among the living beings of an ecology::&quot;A closer examination shows that these beings</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>not only do not damage each other, but often constitute a community of interests</span>
				<span class='text'>It is obvious that the predator is strongly interested in the survival of that species, animal or vegetable, which constitutes its prey</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is not uncommon that the prey species derives specific benefits from its interaction with the predator species</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; pp31–33</span>
				<span class='text'>orenz states that humanity is the one species not bound by these mechanisms, being the only one  that has defined its own environment::&quot;[The pace of human ecology] is determined by the progress of man's technology (p35)</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>human ecology (economy) is governed by mechanisms of POSITIVE feedback, defined  as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to attenuate it (p43)</span>
				<span class='text'>Positive feedback always involves the danger of an 'avalanche' effect</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>One particular kind of positive feedback occurs when individuals OF THE SAME SPECIES enter into competition among themselves</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>For many animal species, environmental factors keep</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>intraspecies selection from [leading to] disaster</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>But there is no force which exercises this type of healthy regulatory effect on humanity's cultural development; unfortunately for itself, humanity has learned to overcome  all those environmental forces which are external to itself&quot; p44</span>
				<span class='text'>orenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, he states that::&quot;A completely new [ecology] which corresponds in every way to [humanity's] desires</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>could, theoretically, prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention (36)</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, the principle of competition, typical of Western societies, destroys any chance of this::&quot;The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic brutality</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole, but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the thirst for money or consuming haste</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in either case, fear plays a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one's competitors,  the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; pp45–47</span>
				<span class='text'>n this book, Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>He illustrates this with a Jewish story, explicitly described as such</span>
				<span class='text'>orenz was one of the early scientists who recognised the significance of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The number one deadly sin of civilized man in his book is overpopulation, which is what leads to aggression</span>
				<span class='text'>==Philosophical speculations===In his 1973 book ''[[Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge]]'', Lorenz considers the old philosophical question of whether our senses correctly inform us about the world as it is, or provide us only with an illusion</span>
				<span class='text'>His answer comes from [[evolutionary biology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Only traits that help us survive and reproduce are transmitted</span>
				<span class='text'>If our senses gave us wrong information about our environment, we would soon be extinct</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, we can be sure that our senses give us correct information, for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived</span>
