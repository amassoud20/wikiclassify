				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', January 26, 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations</span>
				<span class='text'>His career flourished at [[RKO]] when [[David O</span>
				<span class='text'>Selznick]], the studio's Head of Production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO's major films, including ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'' (1932), ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932), ''[[Our Betters]]'' (1933), and ''[[Little Women (1933 film)|Little Women]]'' (1933)</span>
				<span class='text'>When Selznick moved to MGM in 1933, Cukor followed and directed ''[[Dinner at Eight (film)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1933) and ''[[David Copperfield (1935 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1935) for Selznick and ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936) and ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) for [[Irving Thalberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e was replaced as the director of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), but he went on to direct ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954), ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), and ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to work into the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Cukor was born on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in  [[New York City]], the younger child and only son of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Jewish]] immigrants Viktor, an assistant [[district attorney]], and Helén Ilona Gross ([[Married and maiden names|Cukor Viktorné]])</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents selected his middle name in honor of [[Spanish–American War]] hero [[George Dewey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The family was not particularly religious, pork was a staple on the dinner table, and when he started attending temple as a boy, Cukor learned [[Hebrew]] phonetically, with no real understanding of the meaning of the words or what they represented</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he was ambivalent about his faith and dismissive of old world traditions from childhood, and as an adult he embraced [[Anglophilia]] to remove himself even further from his roots</span>

				<span class='text'>5–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a child, Cukor appeared in several amateur plays and took dance lessons, and at the age of seven he performed in a recital with [[David O</span>
				<span class='text'>Selznick]], who in later years would become a mentor and friend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Cukor frequently was taken to the [[New York Hippodrome]] by his uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>Infatuated with [[theatre]], he often cut classes at [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] to attend afternoon matinees</span>

				<span class='text'>26–27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Following his graduation in 1917, Cukor was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in law</span>
				<span class='text'>He halfheartedly enrolled in the [[City College of New York]], where he entered the Students Army Training Corps in October 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>His military experience was limited; Germany surrendered in early November, and Cukor's duty ended after only two months</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after, he left school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cukor obtained a job as an assistant stage manager and bit player with a touring production of ''[[The Better 'Ole]]'', a popular British musical based on [[Old Bill (cartoon character)|Old Bill]], a cartoon character created by [[Bruce Bairnsfather]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he became the stage manager for the Knickerbocker Players, a troupe that shuttled between [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Rochester, New York]], and the following year he was hired as general manager of the newly formed Lyceum Players, an upstate [[summer stock]] company</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1925 he formed the C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and Z</span>
				<span class='text'>Production Company with Walter Folmer and John Zwicki, which gave him his first opportunity to direct</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levy, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>33–34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>34–35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following their first season, he made his [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] directorial debut with ''Antonia'' by Hungarian playwright [[Melchior Lengyel]], then returned to Rochester, where C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and Z</span>
				<span class='text'>evolved into the Cukor-Kondolf Stock Company, a troupe that included [[Louis Calhern]], [[Ilka Chase]], [[Phyllis Povah]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Reginald Owen]], [[Elizabeth Patterson (actress)|Elizabeth Patterson]] and [[Douglass Montgomery]], all of whom would work with Cukor in later years in Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Lasting only one season with the company was [[Bette Davis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor later recalled, &quot;Her talent was apparent, but she did buck at direction</span>
				<span class='text'>She had her own ideas, and though she only did bits and [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] roles, she didn't hesitate to express them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For the next several decades, Davis claimed she was fired, and although Cukor never understood why she placed so much importance on an incident he considered so minor, he never worked with her again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levy, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36–37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For the next few years, Cukor alternated between Rochester in the summer months and Broadway in the winter</span>
				<span class='text'>His direction of a 1926 stage adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[Owen Davis]] brought him to the attention of the New York critics</span>
				<span class='text'>Writing in the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'', drama critic Arthur Pollock called it &quot;an unusual piece of work by a director not nearly so well known as he should be</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cukor directed six more Broadway productions before departing for Hollywood in 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early Hollywood career==When Hollywood began to recruit New York theater talent for [[sound films]], Cukor immediately answered the call</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1928, [[Paramount Pictures]] signed him to a contract that reimbursed him for his airfare and initially paid him $600 per week with no screen credit during a six-month apprenticeship</span>
				<span class='text'>He arrived in Hollywood in February 1929, and his first assignment was to coach the cast of ''River of Romance'' to speak with an acceptable Southern accent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In October, the studio lent him to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] to conduct the screen tests and work as a dialogue director for ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' which was released in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>That year he co-directed three films at Paramount, and his weekly salary was increased to $1500</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>67–69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He made his solo directorial debut with ''[[Tarnished Lady]]'' (1931) starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ukor was then assigned to ''[[One Hour with You]]'' (1932), an [[operetta]] with [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Jeanette MacDonald]], when original director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] opted to concentrate on producing the film instead</span>
				<span class='text'>At first the two men worked well together, but two weeks into filming Lubitsch began arriving on the set on a regular basis, and he soon began directing scenes with Cukor's consent</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon the film's completion, Lubitsch approached Paramount general manager [[B</span>
				<span class='text'>P</span>
				<span class='text'>Schulberg]] and threatened to leave the studio if Cukor's name wasn't removed from the credits</span>
				<span class='text'>When Schulberg asked him to cooperate, Cukor filed suit</span>
				<span class='text'>He eventually settled for being billed as assistant director and then left Paramount to work with [[David O</span>
				<span class='text'>Selznick]] at [[RKO Studios]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>69–71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Cukor quickly earned a reputation as a director who could coax great performances from actresses and he became known as a 'woman's director', a title he resented</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this reputation, during his career, he oversaw more performances honored with the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] than any other director: [[James Stewart]] in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), [[Ronald Colman]] in ''[[A Double Life]]'' (1947), and [[Rex Harrison]] in ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Cukor's first ingenues was actress [[Katharine Hepburn]], who debuted in ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932) and whose looks and personality left RKO officials at a loss as to how to use her</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor directed her in several films, both successful, such as ''[[Little Women (1933 film)|Little Women]]'' (1933) and ''[[Holiday (1938 film)|Holiday]]'' (1938), and disastrous, such as ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1935)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor and Hepburn became close friends off the set</span>
				<span class='text'>ukor was hired to direct ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' by Selznick in 1936, even before the book was published</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next two years involved with pre-production, including supervision of the numerous [[screen test]]s of actresses anxious to portray [[Scarlett O'Hara]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor favored Hepburn for the role, but Selznick, concerned about her reputation as 'box office poison', would not consider her without a screen test, and the actress refused to film one</span>
				<span class='text'>Of those who did, Cukor preferred [[Paulette Goddard]], but her supposedly illicit relationship with [[Charlie Chaplin]] (they were, in fact, secretly married) concerned Selznick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>137–38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Between his ''Wind'' chores, the director assisted with other projects</span>
				<span class='text'>He filmed the cave scene for ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' (1938)&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>139–40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and, following the firing of its original director [[Richard Thorpe]], Cukor spent a week on the set of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he filmed no footage, he made crucial changes to the look of Dorothy by eliminating [[Judy Garland]]'s blonde wig and adjusting her makeup and costume, encouraging her to act in a more natural manner that greatly contributed to the success of the final film</span>

				<span class='text'>145</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Cukor softened the Scarecrow's makeup and gave [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]'s Wicked Witch of the West a different hairstyle, as well as altering her makeup and other facial features</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor also suggested that the studio cast [[Jack Haley]], on loan from [[20th Century Fox]], as the Tin Man</span>
				<span class='text'>ukor spent many hours coaching [[Vivien Leigh]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]] prior to the start of filming ''Wind'', but [[Clark Gable]] resisted his efforts to get him to master a Southern accent</span>
				<span class='text'>However, despite rumors about Gable being uncomfortable with Cukor on the set, nothing in the internal memos of David O</span>
				<span class='text'>Selznick indicates or suggests that Clark Gable played any role in Cukor's dismissal from the film</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, they show Selznick's mounting dissatisfaction with Cukor's slow pace and quality of work</span>
				<span class='text'>From a private letter from journalist Susan Myrick to [[Margaret Mitchell]] in February 1939: &quot;George [Cukor] finally told me all about it</span>
				<span class='text'>He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right</span>
				<span class='text'>For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the things did not click as it should</span>
				<span class='text'>Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the [Sidney] Howard script back</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And bull-headed David said 'OK get out!'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Myrick, Susan White (1986), ''Columns in Hollywood: Reports from the Gwtw Sets'', Mercer University Press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Selznick had already been unhappy with Cukor (&quot;a very expensive luxury&quot;) for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937; and in a confidential memo written in September 1938, four months before principal photography began, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with [[Victor Fleming]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I think the biggest black mark against our management to date is the Cukor situation and we can no longer be sentimental about it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> We are a business concern and not patrons of the arts</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Cukor was relieved of his duties, but he continued to work with Leigh and [[Olivia de Havilland]] off the set</span>
				<span class='text'>Various rumors about the reasons behind his dismissal circulated throughout Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>Selznick's friendship with Cukor had crumbled slightly when the director refused other assignments, including ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star is Born]]'' (1937) and ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Given that Gable and Cukor had worked together before (on ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'', 1934) and Gable had no objection to working with him then, and given Selznick's desperation to get Gable for Rhett Butler, if Gable had any objections to Cukor, certainly they would have been expressed before he signed his contract for the film</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Hollywood Studio Magazine'', &quot;The Great Directors&quot; September 1986</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, writer [[Gore Vidal]], in his autobiography ''Point to Point Navigation'', recounted that Gable demanded that Cukor be fired off ''Wind'' because, according to Cukor, the young Gable had been a male hustler and Cukor had been one of his johns</span>

				<span class='text'>He also directed another of his favorite actresses, [[Greta Garbo]], in ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), her last film before she retired from the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1942, at the age of forty-three, Cukor enlisted in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following basic training at [[Fort Monmouth]], he was assigned to the old [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Paramount]] studios in [[Astoria, Queens]] (where he had directed three films in the early 1930s), although he was permitted to lodge at the [[The St</span>
				<span class='text'>Regis Hotel|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Regis Hotel]] in Manhattan</span>
				<span class='text'>Working with [[Irwin Shaw]], [[John Cheever]] and [[William Saroyan]], among others, Cukor produced training and instructional films for army personnel</span>
				<span class='text'>Because he lacked an officer's commission, he found it difficult to give orders and directions to his superiors</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his efforts to rise above the rank of [[private (rank)|private]]—he even called upon [[Frank Capra]] to intercede on his behalf—he never achieved officer's status or any commendations during his six months of service</span>
				<span class='text'>In later years Cukor suspected his homosexuality impeded him from receiving any advances or honors,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>171–75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; although rumors to that effect could not be confirmed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levy, p</span>
				<span class='text'>150</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The remainder of the decade was a series of hits and misses for Cukor</span>
				<span class='text'>Both ''Two Faced Woman'' and ''[[Her Cardboard Lover]]'' (1942) were commercial failures</span>
				<span class='text'>More successful were ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941) with [[Joan Crawford]] and ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944) with [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Charles Boyer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this era, Cukor forged an alliance with screenwriters [[Garson Kanin]] and [[Ruth Gordon]], who had met in Cukor's home in 1939 and married three years later</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the course of seven years, the trio collaborated on seven films, including ''[[A Double Life]]'' (1947) starring [[Ronald Colman]], ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), ''[[The Marrying Kind]]'' (1952), and ''[[It Should Happen to You]]'' (1954), all featuring another Cukor favorite, [[Judy Holliday]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for ''Born Yesterday''</span>
				<span class='text'>=Later Hollywood career==In December 1952, Cukor was approached by [[Sidney Luft|Sid Luft]], who proposed the director helm a musical remake of ''A Star is Born'' (1937) with his then-wife Judy Garland in the lead role</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor had declined to direct the earlier film because it was too similar to his own ''What Price Hollywood?'' (1932), but the opportunity to direct his first [[Technicolor]] film, first musical, and work with screenwriter [[Moss Hart]] and especially Garland appealed to him, and he accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, 217-18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Getting the updated ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954) to the screen proved to be a challenge</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor wanted [[Cary Grant]] for the male lead and went so far as to read the entire script with him, but Grant, while agreeing it was the role of a lifetime, steadfastly refused to do it, and Cukor never forgave him</span>
				<span class='text'>The director then suggested either [[Humphrey Bogart]] or [[Frank Sinatra]] tackle the part, but [[Jack L</span>
				<span class='text'>Warner]] rejected both</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Stewart Granger]] was the front runner for a period of time, but he backed out when he was unable to adjust to Cukor's habit of acting out scenes as a form of direction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[James Mason]] was eventually contracted, and filming began on October 12, 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>As the months passed, Cukor was forced to deal not only with constant script changes but a very unstable Garland, who was plagued by chemical and alcohol dependencies, extreme weight fluctuations, and real and imagined illnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1954, a rough cut still missing several musical numbers was assembled, and Cukor had mixed feelings about it</span>
				<span class='text'>When the last scene finally was filmed in the early morning hours of July 28, 1954, Cukor already had departed the production and was unwinding in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>224–26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The first preview the following month ran 210 minutes and, despite ecstatic feedback from the audience, Cukor and editor Folmar Blangsted trimmed it to 182 minutes for its New York premiere in October</span>
				<span class='text'>The reviews were the best of Cukor's career, but Warner executives, concerned the running time would limit the number of daily showings, made drastic cuts without Cukor, who had departed for [[Pakistan]] to scout locations for the epic ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' in 1954-55</span>
				<span class='text'>At its final running time of 154 minutes, the film had lost musical numbers and crucial dramatic scenes, and Cukor called it &quot;very painful</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>236–37</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was not included in the film's six Oscar nominations, all of which were lost</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Rehearsing with [[Lee Remick]] in 1962]]Over the next ten years, Cukor directed a handful of films with varying success</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Les Girls]]'' (1957) won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]], and ''[[Wild Is the Wind]]'' (1957) earned Oscar nominations for [[Anna Magnani]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], but neither ''[[Heller in Pink Tights]]'' nor ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (both 1960) were box office hits</span>
				<span class='text'>Another project during this period was the ill-fated ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', an updated remake of the [[screwball comedy]] ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940)</span>
				<span class='text'>Cukor liked leading lady [[Marilyn Monroe]] but found it difficult to deal with her erratic work habits, frequent absences from the set, and the constant presence of her acting coach, [[Paula Strasberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After thirty-two days of shooting, the director had only 7½ minutes of usable film</span>

				<span class='text'>271&quot;&gt;Levy, p</span>
				<span class='text'>271</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Then Monroe travelled to New York to appear at a birthday celebration for [[John F</span>
				<span class='text'>Kennedy]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], where she serenaded the President</span>
				<span class='text'>Studio documents released after Monroe's death confirmed that her appearance at the political fundraising event was approved by Fox executives</span>
				<span class='text'>The production came to a halt when Cukor had filmed every scene not involving Monroe and the actress remained unavailable</span>
				<span class='text'>[[20th Century Fox]] executive Peter Levathes fired her and hired [[Lee Remick]] to replace her, prompting co-star [[Dean Martin]] to quit, since his contract guaranteed he would be playing opposite Monroe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>272</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With the production already $2 million over budget&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy, p</span>
				<span class='text'>271&quot;/&gt; and everyone back at the starting gate, the studio pulled the plug on the project</span>
				<span class='text'>Less than two months later, Monroe was found dead in her home</span>
				<span class='text'>wo years later, Cukor achieved one of his greatest successes with ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964)</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout filming there were mounting tensions between the director and designer [[Cecil Beaton]], but Cukor was thrilled with leading lady [[Audrey Hepburn]], although the crew was less enchanted with her diva-like demands</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Levy, p</span>
				<span class='text'>289</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although several reviews were critical of the film – [[Pauline Kael]] said it &quot;staggers along&quot; and [[Stanley Kauffmann]] thought Cukor's direction was like &quot;a rich gravy poured over everything, not remotely as delicately rich as in the [[Anthony Asquith|Asquith]]-[[Leslie Howard (actor)|Howard]] 1937 [sic] ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]''&quot; —&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p</span>
				<span class='text'>293</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the film was a box office hit which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]], and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] after having been nominated for each several times</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing ''My Fair Lady'', Cukor became less active</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed [[Maggie Smith]] in ''[[Travels with My Aunt (film)|Travels with My Aunt]]'' (1972) and helmed the critical and commercial flop ''[[The Blue Bird (1976 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1976), the first joint Soviet-American production</span>
				<span class='text'>He reunited twice with Katharine Hepburn for the [[television movie]]s ''[[Love Among the Ruins (film)|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Corn Is Green]]'' (1979)</span>
				<span class='text'>He directed his final film, ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]'' (1981) with [[Jacqueline Bisset]] and [[Candice Bergen]], at the age of eighty-two</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, Cukor was awarded the [[George Eastman Award]], given by [[George Eastman House]] for distinguished contribution to the art of film</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Cukor at home in 1973]]It was an [[open secret]] in Hollywood that Cukor was homosexual, although he was discreet about his sexual orientation and &quot;never carried it as a pin on his lapel,&quot; as producer [[Joseph L</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was a celebrated ''[[wikt:bon vivant|bon vivant]]'' whose luxurious home was the site of weekly Sunday afternoon parties attended by [[closeted]] celebrities and the attractive young men they met in bars and gyms and brought with them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>186–87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At least once, in the midst of his reign at MGM, he was arrested on [[vice]] charges, but studio executives managed to get the charges dropped and all records of it expunged, and the incident was never publicized by the press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s, Cukor became involved with a considerably younger man named George Towers</span>
				<span class='text'>He financed his education at the [[California State University, Los Angeles|Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences]] and the [[University of Southern California]], from which Towers graduated with a law degree in 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>277–78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; That fall Towers married, and his relationship with Cukor evolved into one of father and son, and for the remainder of Cukor's life the two remained very close</span>

				<span class='text'>307, 347–48</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By the mid-1930s, Cukor was not only established as a prominent director but, socially, as an unofficial head of Hollywood's gay subculture</span>
				<span class='text'>His home, redecorated in 1935 by gay actor-turned interior designer [[William Haines]] with gardens designed by [[Florence Yoch &amp; Lucile Council]], was the scene of many gatherings for the industry's homosexuals</span>
				<span class='text'>The close-knit group reputedly included Haines and his partner [[Jimmie Shields]], [[Alan Ladd]], writer [[Somerset Maugham]], director [[James Vincent]], screenwriter [[Rowland Leigh]], costume designers [[Orry-Kelly]] and Robert Le Maire, and actors [[John Darrow]], [[Anderson Lawler]], [[Grady Sutton]], Robert Seiter and Tom Douglas</span>
