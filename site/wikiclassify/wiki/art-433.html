				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>}, was a [[Russians|Russian]] composer of the [[Romantic music|late-Romantic]] period, some of whose works are among the most popular music in the [[classical music|classical]] repertoire</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884 by [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]], and awarded a lifetime pension</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a [[civil servant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education</span>
				<span class='text'>When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], from which he graduated in 1865</span>
				<span class='text'>The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement embodied by the Russian composers of [[The Five (composers)|The Five]], with whom his professional relationship was mixed</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>From this reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy</span>
				<span class='text'>The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or from forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence</span>
				<span class='text'>Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of [[Peter the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in uncertainty among the [[intelligentsia]] about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and [[depression (mood)|depression]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for [[boarding school]] followed by his mother's early death, the death of his close friend and colleague [[Nikolai Rubinstein]],  and the collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life, which was his 13-year association with the wealthy widow [[Nadezhda von Meck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[homosexuality|same-sex orientation]], which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some musicologists now downplay its importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to [[cholera]]; there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the [[Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|cause of death]], or if it was accidental or [[suicide|self-inflicted]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hile his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed</span>
				<span class='text'>Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements</span>
				<span class='text'>In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base [[exoticism]], and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music</span>
				<span class='text'>Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as &quot;lacking in elevated thought,&quot; according to longtime ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music critic [[Harold C</span>
				<span class='text'>Schonberg]], and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and would manage the [[Votkinsk|Kamsko-Votkinsk]] Ironworks</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, Petro Fedorovych Chaika, served first as a physician's assistant in the army and later as city governor of [[Glazov]] in Viatka</span>
				<span class='text'>His great-grandfather, a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks|Cossack]] named Fyodor Chaika (accordingly, 'Tchaikovsky' is the derivative of the Ukrainian family name 'Chaika'), distinguished himself under Peter the Great at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's mother, Alexandra Andreyevna {{née}} d'Assier, was the second of Ilya's three wives, 18 years her husband's junior and  [[French people|French]] on her father's side</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, ''Eyes'', 1; Holden, 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both Ilya and Alexandra were trained in the arts, including music—a necessity as a posting to a remote area of Russia also meant a need for entertainment, whether in private or at social gatherings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wiley_tchaik6&quot;&gt;Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Of Tchaikovsky's six siblings,&lt;ref group=a&gt;Tchaikovsky had four brothers (Nikolai, Ippolit, Anatoly and Modest), a sister (Alexandra) and a half-sister (Zinaida) from his father's first marriage (Holden, 6, 13; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 18)</span>
				<span class='text'>Anatoly would later have a prominent legal career, while Modest became a dramatist, [[librettist]], and translator (Poznansky, ''Eyes'', 2)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he was close to his sister Alexandra and twin brothers  Anatoly and [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Modest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexandra's marriage to Lev Davydov&lt;ref&gt;Holden, 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; would produce seven children and lend Tchaikovsky the only real family life he would know as an adult,&lt;ref name=&quot;holden43&quot;/&gt; especially during his years of wandering</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;holden43&quot;&gt;Holden, 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One of those children, [[Vladimir Davydov]], whom the composer would nickname 'Bob', would become very close to him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 202</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1844 the family hired Fanny Dürbach, a 22-year-old French governess</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 22; Holden, 7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was initially thought too young to study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family</span>
				<span class='text'>His insistence convinced Dürbach otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By the age of six, he had become fluent in French and German</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wiley_tchaik6&quot;/&gt; Tchaikovsky also became attached to the young woman; her affection for him was reportedly a counter to his mother's coldness and emotional distance from him,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 27; Holden, 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; though others assert that the mother doted on her son</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, ''Quest'', 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovsky's work from this period, which includes his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 25–26; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tchaikovsky began piano lessons at age five</span>
				<span class='text'>Precocious, within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>His parents, initially supportive, hired a tutor, bought an [[orchestrion]] (a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects), and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they decided in 1850 to send Tchaikovsky to the [[Imperial School of Jurisprudence]] in Saint Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence, which mainly served the lesser nobility, would prepare Tchaikovsky for a career as a civil servant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 31; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of talent, the only musical careers available in Russia at that time&amp;nbsp;– except for the affluent aristocracy&amp;nbsp;– were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters</span>
				<span class='text'>Both were considered on the lowest rung of the social ladder, with individuals in them enjoying no more rights than peasants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father's income was also growing increasingly uncertain, so both parents may have wanted Tchaikovsky to become independent as soon as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  As the minimum age for acceptance was 12 and Tchaikovsky was only 10 at the time, he was required to spend two years boarding at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school, {{convert|800|mi|km|order=flip}} from his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 14; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Once those two years had passed, Tchaikovsky transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Uchilische pravovedenia</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|alt=A row of large, stone three-story buildings alongside a large riverbank</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern view of the Imperial School of Jurisprudence]]Tchaikovsky's early separation from his mother caused an emotional trauma that lasted the rest his life and was intensified by her death from [[cholera]] in 1854, when he was fourteen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 15; Poznansky, ''Quest'', 11–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;Her death affected him so much that he could not inform Fanny Dürbach until two years later (Brown, ''Early'', 47; Holden, 23</span>
				<span class='text'> Warrack, 29)</span>
				<span class='text'>More than 25 years after his loss, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, &quot;Every moment of that appalling day is as vivid to me as though it were yesterday&quot; (As quoted in Holden, 23)&lt;/ref&gt; Her loss also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition, a [[Waltz (music)|waltz]] in her memory</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky's father, who had also contracted cholera but recovered fully, sent him back to school immediately in the hope that classwork would occupy the boy's mind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;holden23&quot;&gt;Holden, 23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Isolated, Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong; these included [[Aleksey Apukhtin]] and Vladimir Gerard</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 23–24, 26; Poznansky, ''Quest'', 32–37; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 30</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Music, while not an official priority at school, also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers</span>
				<span class='text'>They regularly attended the opera&lt;ref&gt;Holden, 24; Poznansky, ''Quest'', 26&lt;/ref&gt; and Tchaikovsky would improvise at the school's [[Pump organ|harmonium]] on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;We were amused,&quot; Vladimir Gerard later remembered, &quot;but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Holden, 25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies through Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school; however, the results, according to musicologist [[David Brown (musicologist)|David Brown]], were &quot;negligible&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger and questioned him about a musical career for his son</span>
				<span class='text'>While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 24–25; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, ''Eyes'', 17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 25; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Civil service; pursuing music===[[File:Youngtchaik</span>

				<span class='text'>Photo, 1863]]On 10 June 1859, the 19-year-old Tchaikovsky graduated as a titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder</span>
				<span class='text'>Appointed to the Ministry of Justice, he became a junior assistant within six months and a senior assistant two months after that</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained a senior assistant for the rest of his three-year civil service career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Man and Music'', 14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Meanwhile, the [[Russian Musical Society]] (RMS) was founded in 1859 by the [[Princess Charlotte of Württemberg|Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna]] (a German-born aunt of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]) and her protégé, pianist and composer [[Anton Rubinstein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Previous tsars and the aristocracy had focused almost exclusively on importing European talent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 31</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the RMS was to fulfill Alexander II's wish to foster native talent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It hosted a regular season of public concerts (previously held only during the six weeks of [[Lent]] when the Imperial Theaters were closed)&lt;ref&gt;Volkov, 71</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and provided basic professional training in music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 35; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended RMS classes in [[music theory]] taught by [[Nikolai Zaremba]] at the [[Russian Museum|Mikhailovsky Palace]] (now the Russian Museum)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 60&lt;/ref&gt; These classes were a precursor to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which opened in 1862</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky enrolled at the Conservatory as part of its premiere class</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] with Zaremba and instrumentation and composition with Rubinstein</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Man and Music'', 20; Holden, 38–39; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 36–38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Conservatory benefited Tchaikovsky in two ways</span>
				<span class='text'>It transformed him into a musical professional, with tools to help him thrive as a composer, and the in-depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively Russian or Western</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;taruskin_go4663&quot;&gt;Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:663–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This mindset became important in Tchaikovsky's reconciliation of Russian and European influences in his compositional style</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed and attempted to show that both these aspects were &quot;intertwined and mutually dependent&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Figes, xxxii; Volkov, 111–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His efforts became both an inspiration and a starting point for other Russian composers to build their own individual styles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hosking, 347</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Rubinstein N &amp; A Postcard-1910</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Anton (right) and Nikolai Rubinstein]]Rubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovsky's musical talent on the whole and cited him as &quot;a composer of genius&quot; in his autobiography&lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, ''Eyes'', 47–8; Rubinstein, 110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovsky's student work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 76; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovsky's reputation grew</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=a&gt;Tchaikovsky ascribed Rubinstein's coolness to a difference in musical temperaments</span>
				<span class='text'>Rubinstein could have been jealous professionally of Tchaikovsky's greater impact as a composer</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Homophobia]] might have been another factor (Poznansky, ''Eyes'', 29)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;An exception to Rubinstein's antipathy was the ''[[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky)|Serenade for Strings]]'', which he declared &quot;Tchaikovsky's best piece&quot; when he heard it in rehearsal</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;At last this St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg pundit, who had growled with such consistent disapproval at Tchaikovsky's successive compositions, had found a work by his former pupil which he could endorse,&quot; according to Tchaikovsky biographer [[David Brown (musicologist)|David Brown]] (Brown, ''Wandering'', 121)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Symphony]] for performance by the RMS in Saint Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 100–101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky, distressed that he had been treated as though he were still their student, withdrew the symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>It was given its first complete performance, minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested, in Moscow in February 1868</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:608</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Once Tchaikovsky graduated in 1865, Rubinstein's brother [[Nikolai Rubinstein|Nikolai]] offered him the post of Professor of Music Theory at the soon-to-open [[Moscow Conservatory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the salary for his professorship was only 50 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly</span>
				<span class='text'>He was further heartened by news of the first public performance of one of his works, his ''Characteristic Dances'', conducted by [[Johann Strauss II]] at a concert in [[Pavlovsk Park]] on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled, ''Dances of the Hay Maidens'', in his opera ''[[The Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 82–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;From 1867 to 1878, Tchaikovsky combined his professorial duties with [[Music journalism|music criticism]] while continuing to compose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 83; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This exposed him to a range of contemporary music and afforded him the opportunity to travel abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his reviews, he praised [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], considered [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] overrated and, despite his admiration, took [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] to task for poor orchestration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;His critique led Tchaikovsky to consider rescoring Schumann's symphonies, a project he never realized (Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 79)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He appreciated the staging of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' at its inaugural performance in [[Bayreuth]], [[Germany]], but not the music, calling ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' &quot;unlikely nonsense, through which, from time to time, sparkle unusually beautiful and astonishing details</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 95</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 8–9; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Balakirev, [[César Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]] became known as the ''moguchaya kuchka'', translated into English as the Mighty Handful or [[The Five (composers)|The Five]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Garden, ''New Grove (2001)'', 8:913</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While ambivalent about much of The Five's music, Tchaikovsky remained on friendly terms with most of its members</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Man and Music'', 49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The group also welcomed his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Tchaikovsky)|Second Symphony]], subtitled the ''Little Russian''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 255</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group as well as from the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 51–52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Growing fame; budding opera composer====The infrequency of Tchaikovsky's musical successes, won with tremendous effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Nikolai Rubinstein's private fits of rage critiquing his music, most famously attacking the [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Piano Concerto]], did not help matters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wiley25147&quot;/&gt; His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hans von Bülow]] premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 474–6; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:161</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other artists included [[Adele Aus der Ohe]], [[Max Erdmannsdörfer]], [[Eduard Nápravník]] and [[Sergei Taneyev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Hans von buelow</span>

				<span class='text'>The conductor [[Hans von Bülow]]]]Another factor that helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was a shift in attitude among Russian audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:153–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the late 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas</span>
				<span class='text'>His first, ''[[The Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]'', based on a play by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]], premiered in 1869</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Undina (Tchaikovsky)|Undina]]'' followed in 1870</span>
				<span class='text'>Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taruskin 665&quot;&gt;Taruskin, 665</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called ''Mandragora'', to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, 75–6; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 58–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact, ''[[The Oprichnik]]'', premiered in 1874</span>
				<span class='text'>During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky's part-finished libretto</span>
				<span class='text'> Tchaikovsky, too embarrassed to ask for another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modelling his dramatic technique on that of [[Eugène Scribe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Cui wrote a &quot;characteristically savage press attack&quot; on the opera</span>
				<span class='text'>Mussorgsky, writing to [[Vladimir Stasov]], disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, ''The Oprichnik'' continues to be performed from time to time in Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Taruskin 665&quot;/&gt;The last of the early operas, ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'' (Op</span>
				<span class='text'>4), was composed in the second half of 1874</span>
				<span class='text'>The libretto, based on [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]'s ''[[Christmas Eve (Gogol)|Christmas Eve]]'', was to have been set to music by [[Alexander Serov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With Serov's death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Viking'', 1086</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote an opera based on the same story, ''[[Christmas Eve (opera)|Christmas Eve]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 171</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Other works of this period include the ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' for [[cello]] and orchestra, the Second and [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>4 (Tchaikovsky)|Fourth Symphonies]], the ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and the opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It has also at times caused considerable confusion, from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] efforts to expunge all references to same-sex attraction and portray him as a heterosexual, to efforts at armchair analysis by Western biographers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 133–4; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', xvii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was gay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, ''Quest'', all</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods, &quot;associating openly and establishing professional connections with them</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, the degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual nature has remained open to debate</span>
				<span class='text'>It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to musicologist and biographer [[David Brown (musicologist)|David Brown]], &quot;felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced &quot;no unbearable guilt&quot; over his sexual nature&lt;ref name=&quot;wiley25147&quot;/&gt; and &quot;eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Nadezhda von Meck, Tchaikovsky's patroness and confidante from 1877 to 1890]]Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he completed ''Eugene Onegin'', orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 159, 170, 193</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Crisis'', 297</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;Rubinstein had actually been operating under the assumption that Tchaikovsky might leave from the onset of the composer's marital crisis and was prepared for it (Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 189–90)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his meddling in the Tchaikovsky–von Meck relationship might have contributed to the composer's actual departure</span>
				<span class='text'>Rubinstein's actions, which soured his relations with both Tchaikovsky and von Meck, included imploring von Meck in person to end Tchaikovsky's subsidy for the composer's own good (Brown, ''Crisis'', 250; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 188–9)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rubinstein's actions, in turn, had been spurred by Tchaikovsky's withdrawal from the Russian delegation for the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris World's Fair]], a position for which Rubinstein had lobbied on the composer's behalf (Brown, ''Crisis'', 249–50; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 180, 188–189)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rubinstein had been scheduled to conduct four concerts there; the first featured Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto (Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 190)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brmm219&quot;&gt;Brown, ''Man and Music'', 219</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s call for &quot;universal unity&quot; with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered &quot;overly dependent on the West</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;volkovsp126&quot;&gt;Volkov, 126</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Léon Bakst]] and [[Sergei Diaghilev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Volkov, 122–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Two musical works from this period stand out</span>
				<span class='text'>With the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881,&lt;ref group=a&gt;Celebration of this anniversary did not take place as [[Assassination of Alexander II|Alexander II was assassinated]] in March 1881</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the ''[[1812 Overture]]'', would be &quot;very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brwa119&quot;&gt;As quoted in Brown, ''Wandering'', 119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that &quot;I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brwa119&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, &quot;the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brmm224&quot;&gt;Brown, ''Man and Music'', 224</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 23 March 1881, Nikolai Rubinstein died in [[Paris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That December, Tchaikovsky started work on his [[Piano Trio (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Trio in A&amp;nbsp;minor]], &quot;dedicated to the memory of a great artist</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Brown, ''Wandering'', 151</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; First performed privately at the Moscow Conservatory on the first anniversary of Rubinstein's death, the piece became extremely popular during the composer's lifetime; in November 1893, it would become Tchaikovsky's own elegy at memorial concerts in Moscow and St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Wandering'', 151-2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;a&quot;&gt;The piece also fulfilled a long-standing request by von Meck for such a work, to be performed by her then-house pianist, [[Claude Debussy]] (Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:620)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|alt=A group of ballet dancers dressed in 17th-century costumes</span>
				<span class='text'>Original cast of Tchaikovsky's ballet, ''The Sleeping Beauty'', Saint Petersburg, 1890]]Tchaikovsky wrote many works that are popular with the classical music public, including his ''Romeo and Juliet'', the ''1812 Overture'', his three ballets (''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'') and ''[[Marche Slave]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]], the last three of his six numbered [[symphony|symphonies]] and his operas ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' and ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', are among his most familiar works</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost as popular are the [[Manfred Symphony|''Manfred'' Symphony]], ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Tchaikovsky)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', the ''[[Capriccio Italien]]'' and the [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky)|Serenade for Strings]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;schonberg367&quot;&gt;Schonberg, 367</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Creative range===Tchaikovsky displayed an unusually wide stylistic and emotional range, from [[Salon music|salon works]] of innocuous charm to symphonies of tremendous depth, power and grandeur</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his works, such as the ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'', employ a poised &quot;Classical&quot; form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite)</span>
				<span class='text'>Other compositions, such as his [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (Tchaikovsky)|''Little Russian'' symphony]] and his opera ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'', flirt with musical practices more akin to those of the Five, especially in their use of folk song</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other works, such as Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies, employ a personal musical idiom that facilitated intense emotional expression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:606</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Ukrainian folk elements===Many of Tchaikovsky's works have [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] subjects or incorporate Ukrainian folk songs or melodies</span>
				<span class='text'>Among these are the operas ''Mazepa'' (based on [[Pushkin, Aleksandr Sergeyevich|Aleksandr Pushkin's]] poem), ''Little Shoes'', and ''Night before Christmas'' (or ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'', based on [[Nikolai Gogol|Nikolai Gogol's]] story); symphonies No</span>

				<span class='text'>Schonberg]] wrote of Tchaikovsky's &quot;sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of [[melody]],&quot; a feature that has ensured his music's continued success with audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;schonberg366&quot;&gt;Schonberg, 366</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brown_ng18628&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately, Brown points out, Tchaikovsky's melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways</span>
				<span class='text'>The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained; they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development</span>
				<span class='text'>On a technical level, it made [[modulation (music)|modulating]] to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=brown_final424&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 424</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers</span>
				<span class='text'>They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with [[sonata form]], such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven, but were complete and independent in themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 26</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another</span>
				<span class='text'>This challenge was why, Cooper maintains, the Romantics &quot;were never natural symphonists</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest and satisfy listeners</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 8–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Harmony====Harmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 422, 432–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[modulation (music)|Modulation]], the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and [[sonata form]], the primary Western large-scale [[musical form|musical structure]] since the middle of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''New Grove (1980)'', 12:454</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One point in Tchaikovsky's favor was &quot;a flair for harmony&quot; that &quot;astonished&quot; Rudolph Kündinger, Tchaikovsky's music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Polyansky, ''Eyes'', 18</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the [[whole tone scale]] in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brown_ng18628&quot;/&gt;====Rhythm====[[Rhythm (music)|Rhythmically]], Tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual [[Meter (music)|meters]]</span>
				<span class='text'>More often, he used a firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music</span>
				<span class='text'>At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music</span>
				<span class='text'>They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements—a &quot;synthetic propulsion,&quot; as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements</span>
				<span class='text'>This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; ''Final'', 424</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (For more on this, please see '''[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Repetition|Repetition]]''' below</span>
				<span class='text'>====Structure====Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form</span>
				<span class='text'>Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brown_final424&quot;&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 424</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown and musicologists [[Hans Keller]] and [[Daniel Zhitomirsky]], Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony</span>
				<span class='text'>He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an &quot;outline,&quot; as Zhitomirsky phrases it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;zhitomirsky102&quot;&gt;Zhitomirsky, 102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls &quot;new and violent contrasts&quot; between [[Theme (music)|musical themes]], [[Key (music)|keys]] and harmonies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 426; Keller, 347</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum&lt;ref name=&quot;brown_final426&quot;&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 426</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and adds intense drama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Keller, 346–7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While the result, Warrack charges, is still &quot;an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them&quot; in the Germanic sense,&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Brown counters that it took the listener of the period &quot;through a succession of often highly charged sections which ''added up'' to a radically new kind of symphonic experience&quot; (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brown_final426&quot;/&gt;Partly due to the melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to the composer's nature, Tchaikovsky's music became intensely expressive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Keller, 346–7; Maes, 161</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovsky's name alongside that of Dostoyevsky</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Volkov, 115&lt;/ref&gt; German musicologist [[Hermann Kretzschmar]] credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering &quot;full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>This music has the mark of the truly lived and felt experience</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Botstein, 101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovsky's music &quot;became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener’s own emotional self</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This active engagement with the music &quot;opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one’s own 'truly lived and felt experience' or one’s search for intensity in a deeply personal sense</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Botstein, 101&quot;&gt;Botstein, 101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Repetition====[[File:Sequence ascending from C tonal</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|right|350px|Sequence ascending by step {{Audio|Sequence ascending from C tonal</span>
				<span class='text'>id|Play}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Note that there are only four segments, continuously higher, and that the segments continue by the same distance (seconds: C-D, D-E, etc</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]As mentioned above, repetition was a natural part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it is an integral part of Russian music</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 9</span>
				<span class='text'>Also see Brown, ''Final'', 422–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His use of [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] within melodies ([[repetition (music)|repeating]] a tune at a higher or lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in the same voice)&lt;ref&gt;Benward and Saker, 111–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; could go on for extreme length</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brown_ng18628&quot;/&gt; The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 423–4; Warrack, ''Symphonies'', 9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Maes161&quot;&gt;Maes, 161</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging</span>
				<span class='text'>By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building &quot;into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity,&quot; as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove'' (1980), 18:628</span>
				<span class='text'>Also see Bostrick, 105</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (For more on this practice, see the next section</span>
				<span class='text'>====Orchestration====Like other late Romantic composers, Tchaikovsky relied heavily on [[orchestration]] for musical effects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holoman, ''New Grove (2001)'', 12:413</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky, however, became noted for the &quot;sensual opulence&quot; and &quot;voluptuous timbrel virtuosity&quot; of his scoring</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:669</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Like Glinka, Tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary colors and sharply delineated contrasts of texture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Hopkins, ''New Grove (1980)'', 13:698</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning with the [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Tchaikovsky)|Third Symphony]], Tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of timbres&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers</span>
				<span class='text'>Rimsky-Korsakov regularly referred his students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to it and called it &quot;devoid of all striving after effect, [to] give a healthy, beautiful sonority</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Taruskin, ''Stravinsky'', 206</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This sonority, musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] points out, is essentially Germanic in effect</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky's expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously (a practice called doubling) and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in &quot;a generalized orchestral sonority in which the individual timbres of the instruments, being thoroughly mixed, would vanish</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, ''Stravinsky'', 206&lt;/ref&gt;====Pastiche (Passé-ism)====In works like the Serenade for Strings and the ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th century European [[pastiche]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In the ballet ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and the opera ''The Queen of Spades'', Tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full-scale evocation</span>
				<span class='text'>This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls &quot;passé-ism,&quot; lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem as though it were the present</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Volkov, 124</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them</span>
				<span class='text'>His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn</span>
				<span class='text'>(In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to [[Igor Stravinsky]], who turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] partly as a form of compositional self-discovery</span>
				<span class='text'> Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:613, 615</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Antecedents and influences===[[File:Robert Schumann 1839</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|180px|Robert Schumann, lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839]]Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist [[Roland John Wiley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:613, 18:620; Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 58</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Asafyev, 13–14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Botstein]] claims the music of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bostein, 103</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;As proof of Wagner's influence, Botstein cites a letter from Tchaikovsky to Taneyev, in which the composer &quot;readily admits the influence of the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Nibelungen]]'' on ''Francesca da Rimini''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This letter is quoted in Brown, ''Crisis'', 108</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by [[Franz Lachner]], [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Joachim Raff]] after the rediscovery of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:681–2; Maes, 155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera ''[[The Demon (opera)|The Demon]]'' became a model for the final tableau of ''Eugene Onegin''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:664</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; So did [[Léo Delibes]]' ballets ''[[Coppélia]]'' and ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' for ''The Sleeping Beauty''&lt;ref group=a&gt;While it is sometimes thought these two ballets also influenced Tchaikovsky's work on ''Swan Lake'', he had already composed that work before learning of them (Brown, ''Crisis'', 77)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]]'' (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for ''The Queen of Spades''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Final'', 189–9; Maes, 131, 138, 152</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiley_tchaik293&quot;/&gt; Mozart, whose music he loved;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiley_tchaik293&quot;&gt;Wiley, ''Tchaikovsky'', 293–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Glinka, whose opera ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 34, 97</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adolphe Adam]], whose ballet ''[[Giselle]]'' was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on ''The Sleeping Beauty''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 39, 52, ''Final'', 187</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:149</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] and [[Henry Litolff]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Early'', 72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Aesthetic impact===Maes maintains that, regardless of what he was writing, Tchaikovsky's main concern was how his music impacted his listeners on an aesthetic level, at specific moments in the piece and on a cumulative level once the music had finished</span>
				<span class='text'>What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 138</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart</span>
				<span class='text'>Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th century feudal nation, the statement is not actually that surprising</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Figes, 274; Maes, 139–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; And yet, even when writing so-called 'programme music, for example his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form</span>
				<span class='text'> His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;maes137&quot;&gt;Maes, 137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned ''The Sleeping Beauty'' from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for ''The Queen of Spades'' from Modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 146, 152</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;Vsevolozhsky originally intended the libretto for a now-unknown composer named Nikolai Klenovsky, not Tchaikovsky (Maes, 152)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky also used the [[polonaise]] frequently, the dance being a musical code for the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] and a symbol of Russian patriotism</span>
				<span class='text'>Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Figes, 274; Maes, 78–9, 137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Reception=======Dedicatees and collaborators====[[File:Marius Ivanovich Petipa -Feb</span>
				<span class='text'>14 1898</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|180px|thumb|upright|Marius Petipa]]Tchaikovsky's relationship with collaborators was mixed</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue [[Leopold Auer]] rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught it to his students, who included [[Jascha Heifetz]] and [[Nathan Milstein]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Fitzenhagen]] &quot;intervened considerably in shaping what he considered 'his' piece,&quot; the ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', according to music critic [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen's license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist's amendments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Crisis'', 122</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;The composer's original has since been published but most cellists still perform Fitzenhagen's version (Campbell, 77)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in [[Marius Petipa]], who worked with him on the last two, he might have found an advocate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref group=a&gt;Tchaikovsky's work with Julius Reisinger on ''Swan Lake'' was evidently also successful, since it left him with no qualms about working with Petipa, but very little is written about it (Maes, 146)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Sleeping Beauty'' was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort</span>
				<span class='text'>Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 145–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Critics====[[File:Hanslick</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|left|Eduard Hanslick]]Critical reception to Tchaikovsky's music has also varied but also improved over time</span>
				<span class='text'>Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;botstein99&quot;&gt;Botstein, 99</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There might have been a grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the &quot;indeterminacy of [Tchaikovsky's] artistic character </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>being truly at home in the non-Russian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Botstein, 100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, [[Eduard Hanslick]] lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition &quot;whose stink one can hear&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hanslick, Eduard, ''Music Criticisms 1850–1900'', ed</span>
				<span class='text'>and trans</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry Pleasants (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>As quoted in Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 487</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, &quot;The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a hoard of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker</span>
				<span class='text'>Pandemonium, [[delerium tremens]], raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Evening Transcript'', October 23, 1892</span>
				<span class='text'>As quoted in Steinberg, ''Symphony'', 631&lt;/ref&gt;The division between Russian and Western critics remained through much of the 20th century but for a different reason</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences—its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration—added up to compositional shallowness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:169</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;brown_ng18628&quot;/&gt; There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, &quot;spoke to the listener’s imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the &quot;violence and 'hysteria' &quot; they detected and felt such emotive displays &quot;attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation—the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment—and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Botstein, 101&quot;/&gt;There has also been the fact that the composer did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Maes161&quot;/&gt; Even with what Schonberg termed &quot;a professional reevaluaton&quot; of Tchaikovsky's work,&lt;ref name=&quot;schonberg367&quot;/&gt; the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1992 article, ''New York Times'' critic [[Allan Kozinn]] writes, &quot;It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded in the context of the whole literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The First Piano Concerto is a case in point</span>
				<span class='text'>It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression</span>
				<span class='text'>But it is entirely hollow</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;schonberg367&quot;/&gt; &quot;Tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence,&quot; according to [[Cultural history|cultural historian]] and author [[Joseph Horowitz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;horowitz&quot;/&gt; Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wiley_ng25169&quot;&gt;Wiley, ''New Grove (2001), 25:169</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We have acquired a different view of Romantic 'excess,'&quot; Horowitz says</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horowitz&quot;/&gt; Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, &quot;Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Botstein, 100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:606–7, 628</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including Great Britain and the United States, second only to that of Beethoven</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;wi25169&quot;/&gt; His music has also been used frequently in the realms of popular music and film</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''The Symphony'', 611</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Legacy===According to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Thanks in large part to Nadezhda von Meck&quot;, Wiley writes, &quot;he became the first full-time professional Russian composer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style</span>
				<span class='text'>He made an impact not only in absolute works such as the symphony but also in program music and, as Wiley phrases it, &quot;transformed Liszt's and Berlioz's achievements </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back</span>
				<span class='text'>They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook</span>
				<span class='text'>He was, they write, for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holden, xxi; Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Maes and Taruskin write that Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 4:663</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 73</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along at a time when the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded</span>
				<span class='text'>The composer's friend, music critic [[Hermann Laroche]], wrote of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' that the score contained &quot;an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody</span>
				<span class='text'>This basic element is undoubtedly Russian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Maes, 166</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Tchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maes, 73; Taruskin, ''Grove Opera'', 664</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged not just to Russia but to the world at large</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;taruskin_go4663&quot;/&gt; Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;volkovsp126&quot;/&gt; It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to personally acquaint foreign audiences with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Warrack, 209</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of Tchaikovsky, [[Anthony Holden]] recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: &quot;Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into [[20th-century music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Between these two very different worlds Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge</span>
