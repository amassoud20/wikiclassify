				<span class='text'>n June 1964 Brian began recording the bulk of The Beach Boys Christmas Album with a forty one piece studio orchestra in collaboration with  arranger </span>
				<span class='text'>Released in December it was divided between five new original Christmas themed songs and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs</span>

				<span class='text'>Some love songs remained but with a marked increase in depth along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements</span>
				<span class='text'>While the bands contemporaries grew more intellectually aware Capitol continued to bill them as America’s Top Surfin Group expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1965 the band released Summer Days And Summer Nights</span>
				<span class='text'>The album included a reworked arrangement of  which became the bands second number one single in the spring of 1965 displacing the Beatles </span>

				<span class='text'>In November 1965 the group followed their US number three charting California Girls from Summer Days And Summer Nights with another top twenty single </span>
				<span class='text'>It was considered the bands most experimental statement thus far using silence as a pre chorus clashing keyboards moody brass and vocal tics</span>
				<span class='text'>The single continued Brians ambitions for daring arrangements featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings</span>

				<span class='text'>Influenced by s Brian turned inward and probed his deep seated self doubts and emotional longings the piece did not address the problems in the world around them unlike other  groups</span>
				<span class='text'>As  wrote of the albums tone It vented Wilsons obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security</span>
				<span class='text'>The whole enterprise which smacked of  pretensions was streaked with regret and romantic langour</span>

				<span class='text'>This helped the Beach Boys become the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966 dethroning the three year reign of native bands such as the Beatles</span>

				<span class='text'>name pc37  Its failure to gain a wider recognition in the US combined with Capitols decision to issue  in July dispirited Brian who considered Pet Sounds an extremely personal work</span>

				<span class='text'>name Riding a wave   named it one of his favorite albums of all time on multiple occasions calling it the primary impetus for the Beatles album  1967</span>

				<span class='text'>eeking to expand on Pet Sounds advances Wilson began an even more ambitious project </span>
				<span class='text'>Like Pet Sounds Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music</span>
				<span class='text'>Described by Brian as a pocket symphony it contains a mixture of classical rock and exotic instruments structured around a  of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts</span>
				<span class='text'>It became the Beach Boys biggest hit to date and a US and UK number one single in 1966</span>
				<span class='text'>Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point</span>
				<span class='text'>The production costs were estimated between 50000 and 75000   and  today with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios</span>

				<span class='text'>he single was an unequivocal milestone in studio productions and continued in establishing Brian as an extender of popular tastes</span>
				<span class='text'>name Riding a wave  To the counterculture of the 1960s Good Vibrations served as an anthem</span>

				<span class='text'>  Upon release the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of s leading  to produce their own brand of  instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>Reflecting on this period in 1971  magazine wrote In the year and a half that followed Pet Sounds the Beach Boys were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture – psychedelia  a return to roots ecology organic food the cooled out sound – anticipating changes that rock didnt accomplish until 1969–1970</span>
				<span class='text'> The group established a short lived film  called Home Movies during this time</span>
				<span class='text'>It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys</span>

				<span class='text'>rian met lyricist and musician  while working on Pet Sounds</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later while in the midst of recording Good Vibrations the duo began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for the Beach Boys forthcoming album Smile intended to surpass Pet Sounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Recording for the album spanned about a year from 1966 to 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>It is known that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Surviving recordings have shown that the music incorporated  s explorations in  and  jazz s with classical elements  sound effects  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Parks has stated he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture and the two had felt estranged from it but it was necessary to adhere to because of a willingness to get out of the  mindset</span>
				<span class='text'>Parks stresses At the same time he didnt want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had</span>
				<span class='text'>He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing citing an instance when Brian instructed a banjo player to play only one string a gauche style of playing that just wasnt done</span>
				<span class='text'>mile would go on to become the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music</span>
				<span class='text'>In the decades following its non release it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique</span>
				<span class='text'>Many believe that had the album been released it would have substantially altered the groups direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators</span>
				<span class='text'>Writing about the album for the  book series Luis Sanchez stated If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were Smile was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music which if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966 might have had an incredible impact</span>
				<span class='text'>any factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as Smile neared completion his mental instability the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music the relatively unenthusiastic response to Pet Sounds in the United States Carl Wilsons  resistance and a major dispute with </span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore Wilsons reliance on both prescription drugs and s exacerbated his underlying mental health problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Comparable to  and  Brian Wilsons use of psychedelic drugs—especially —led to a nervous breakdown in the late 1960s</span>

				<span class='text'>Along with the single version of Good Vibrations these tracks were released on the album Smiley Smile which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1969 the group filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Capitol Records for over two million dollars and at the same time severed their relationship with the label</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite the cancellation of Smile several tracks—including   and —continued to trickle out in later albums often as  to offset Brians unwillingness to contribute</span>
				<span class='text'>The band was still expecting to complete and release Smile as late as 1973 before it became clear that only Brian could comprehend the endless fragments that had been recorded</span>
