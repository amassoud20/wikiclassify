				<span class='text'>]Johnson and [[Larry Bird]] were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] finals</span>
				<span class='text'>The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily [[box score]] was the first thing he checked in the morning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;magiclarryquotes&quot; /&gt;Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (&quot;Showtime&quot;) and Boston/Indiana [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] grit (&quot;Celtic Pride&quot;), and between blacks and whites</span>
