				<span class='text'>Taking power in a coup d'etat, he ruled as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977 and then as the &quot;[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brotherly Leader]]&quot; of the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011, when he was ousted in the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially developing his own variant of [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] known as the [[Third International Theory]], he later embraced [[Pan-Africanism]] and served as [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Early life and the republic--&gt;  The son of an impoverished [[Bedouin]] goat herder, Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], subsequently enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969 they seized power from the [[absolute monarchy]] of [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]] in a [[Nonviolent revolution|bloodless]] [[Libyan coup d'etat (1969)|coup]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Becoming Chairman of the governing [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]] (RCC), Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign [[imperialism|imperialist]] influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments</span>
				<span class='text'>Intent on pushing Libya towards &quot;[[Islamic socialism]]&quot;, he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1973 he initiated a &quot;Popular Revolution&quot; with the formation of [[General People's Committee]]s (GPCs), purported to be a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Jamahiriya and downfall--&gt;In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new [[socialist state]], the ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (&quot;state of the masses&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Officially adopting a symbolic role in governance, he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] led to Libya's label of &quot;international pariah&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 U</span>

				<span class='text'>Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments, from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations, also embracing Pan-Africanism and helping to establish the African Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Amid the [[Arab Spring]], in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) broke out, resulting in civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>[[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the NTC, bringing about the government's downfall</span>
				<span class='text'>Retreating to [[Sirte]], Gaddafi was [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!--Legacy and assessment:--&gt;Gaddafi was a controversial and highly divisive world figure</span>
				<span class='text'>Supporters lauded his [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] stance and his support for Pan-Africanism and [[Pan-Arabism]], and he was decorated with various awards</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversely, he was internationally condemned as a dictator and autocrat whose authoritarian administration violated the [[Human rights in Libya|human rights of Libyan citizens]], and supported [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements, tribal warfare and [[terrorism]] in many other nations</span>
