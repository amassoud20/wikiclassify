				<span class='text'>Acting teacher [[Lee Strasberg]] once observed: &quot;The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Cooper's performance in ''Sergeant York'', director Howard Hawks observed, &quot;He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>this isn't going to be any good</span>
				<span class='text'>But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-153&quot;/&gt; Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in ''Pride of the Yankees'', noting, &quot;What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach</span>
				<span class='text'>On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p</span>
				<span class='text'>165</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor</span>
				<span class='text'>Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, &quot;The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed</span>
				<span class='text'>You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was a major movie star from the end of the [[silent film|silent film era]] to the end of the golden age of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classical Hollywood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His natural and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres, including Westerns, war films, adventure films, drama films, crime films, romance films, comedy films, and romantic comedy films</span>
				<span class='text'>He appeared on the ''Motion Picture Herald'' exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, from 1936 to 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;arce-147&quot;/&gt; According to Quigley's annual poll, Cooper was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen years, appearing in the top ten in 1936–37, 1941–49, and 1951–57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;quigley&quot;/&gt; He topped the list in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;quigley&quot;/&gt; In Quigley's list of all-time money-making stars, Cooper is listed fourth, after John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Tom Cruise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;quigley&quot;/&gt; At the time of his death, it was estimated that his films grossed well over $200 million&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-2&quot;/&gt; (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000000|1961}}}} today)</span>
				<span class='text'>n over half of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action</span>

				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the rest he played a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-2&quot;/&gt; Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career</span>

				<span class='text'>219</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (''The Virginian'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot;/&gt; After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (''A Farewell to Arms'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot;/&gt; During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (''Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Deeds'', ''Meet John Doe'', and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;kaminsky-219&quot;/&gt; In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (''The Fountainhead'' and ''High Noon'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>219–220</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (''Friendly Persuasion'' and ''Man of the West'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>220–221</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man</span>

				<span class='text'>324</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On February 6, 1960, Cooper was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;walk-of-fame&quot;/&gt; He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ricker&quot;/&gt; On May 6, 1961, he was awarded the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]] in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-308&quot;/&gt; On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the [[David di Donatello]] Special Award in Italy for his career achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;david&quot;/&gt; In 1966, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City</span>
