				<span class='text'>One of the scientific developments during this era came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, beginning in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]—now generally known as [[radio waves]], at the time more commonly called &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; or &quot;aetheric waves&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries, and a renewed interest on the part of Marconi</span>
				<span class='text'>He was permitted to briefly study the subject under [[Augusto Righi]], a [[University of Bologna]] physicist and neighbour of Marconi who had done research on Hertz's work</span>

				<span class='text'>He also encouraged him to come to England where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert the findings from Marconi's experiment into a practical use</span>
				<span class='text'>inding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work; Marconi spoke fluent English in addition to Italian</span>

				<span class='text'>9625]&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;At the turn of the 20th century, Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at [[Marconi House]], Rosslare Strand, [[Co</span>
				<span class='text'>Wexford]] in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall and [[Clifden]] in [[Co</span>
				<span class='text'>Galway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon made the announcement that on 12 December 1901, using a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of Canada) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The distance between the two points was about {{convert|2200|mi|km}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Heralded as a great scientific advance, there was—and continues to be—considerable skepticism about this claim</span>
				<span class='text'>The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighborhood of 350 meters</span>
				<span class='text'>The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight</span>
				<span class='text'>We now know (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice</span>
				<span class='text'>At this medium wavelength, long distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not a blind test—Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter ''S''</span>
				<span class='text'>The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|Marconi caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1905]]Feeling challenged by [[Scientific skepticism|skeptics]], Marconi prepared a better organized and documented test</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1902, the SS ''Philadelphia'' sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station</span>
				<span class='text'>The test results produced [[Magnetic detector|coherer-tape]] reception up to {{convert|1550|mi|km}}, and audio reception up to {{convert|2100|mi|km}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that for [[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions, radio signals travel much farther at night than in the day</span>
				<span class='text'>During the daytime, signals had only been received up to about {{convert|700|mi|km}}, less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists' belief they were essentially limited to line-of-sight distances</span>
				<span class='text'>n 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1901, Marconi built a station near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|South Wellfleet, Massachusetts]] that on 18 January 1903 sent a message of greetings from [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>This station also was one of the first to receive the [[distress signals]] coming from the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish</span>
				<span class='text'>arconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1904 a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers</span>
				<span class='text'>A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marconi100</span>

				<span class='text'>Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter, the [[New Street Works]] factory in [[Chelmsford]] was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the United Kingdom, featuring Dame [[Nellie Melba]]</span>
