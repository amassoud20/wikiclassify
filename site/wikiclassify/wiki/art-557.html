				<span class='text'>While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period</span>
				<span class='text'>There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of &quot;general truth&quot; and &quot;general beauty&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the &quot;disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind&quot;; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that &quot;To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy</span>
				<span class='text'>Against Reynolds' fashionable oil painting, Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]]</span>
				<span class='text'>avid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather &quot;against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice</span>

				<span class='text'>Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium</span>
				<span class='text'>Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscripts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name)</span>
				<span class='text'>his is a reversal of the usual method of etching&lt;!--same article as relief etching--&gt;, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method</span>
				<span class='text'>Relief etching (which Blake referred to as &quot;[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]&quot; in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio</span>
				<span class='text'>Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different</span>
				<span class='text'>The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in water colours and stitched together to form a volume</span>
				<span class='text'>Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Engravings===Although Blake has become most famous for his relief etching, his commercial work largely consisted of [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio engraving]], the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate, a complex and laborious process, with plates taking months or years to complete, but as Blake's contemporary, [[John Boydell]], realised, such engraving offered a &quot;missing link with commerce&quot;, enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work, most notably for the [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations of the Book of Job]], completed just before his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as &quot;[[repoussage]]&quot;, a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate</span>
				<span class='text'>Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete</span>

				<span class='text'>Blake's vision of [[Hecate]], Greek goddess of black magic and the underworld]]===Felpham===In 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808)</span>
				<span class='text'>The preface to this work includes a poem beginning &quot;[[And did those feet in ancient time]]&quot;, which became the words for the anthem &quot;[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with &quot;the meer drudgery of business&quot; (E724)</span>
				<span class='text'>Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that &quot;Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right| Sketch of Blake from circa 1804 by [[John Flaxman]]]]Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]'' (1804–20), his most ambitious work</span>
				<span class='text'>Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving</span>
				<span class='text'>Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept</span>
				<span class='text'>When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard</span>
				<span class='text'>He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a &quot;brilliant analysis&quot; of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy|''Inferno'']]]]Blake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured</span>
				<span class='text'>Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, &quot;Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All &amp; the Goddess Nature &amp; not the Holy Ghost</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s)</span>
				<span class='text'>t the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially</span>
				<span class='text'>Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching</span>

				<span class='text'>Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]</span>

				<span class='text'>=Development of Blake's views==Because Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Gillham</span>
				<span class='text'>he earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the &quot;Devil&quot; is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity</span>
				<span class='text'>In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works</span>
				<span class='text'>sychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the &quot;Bible of Hell&quot; promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''</span>
				<span class='text'>Regarding Blake's final poem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, she writes: &quot;The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p</span>
				<span class='text'>229</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;John Middleton Murry notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a &quot;sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason&quot;, the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness</span>
				<span class='text'>This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works</span>
				<span class='text'>Murry characterises the later Blake as having found &quot;mutual understanding&quot; and &quot;mutual forgiveness&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Blake is sometimes considered (along with [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her husband [[William Godwin]]) a forerunner of the 19th-century &quot;[[free love]]&quot; movement, a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery, and advocated the removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality, prostitution, and adultery, culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsjö who moderately challenges this interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>The 19th-century &quot;free love&quot; movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was &quot;legal prostitution&quot; and monopolistic in character</span>

				<span class='text'>Poems such as &quot;Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?&quot; and &quot;Earth's Answer&quot; seem to advocate multiple sexual partners</span>
				<span class='text'>In his poem &quot;[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]&quot; he speaks of &quot;the Marriage-Hearse&quot; plagued by &quot;the youthful Harlot's curse&quot;, the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry</span>
				<span class='text'>''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love</span>
				<span class='text'>For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the &quot;frozen marriage-bed&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Visions'', Blake writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Till she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is boundIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chainOf life in weary lust? (5</span>
				<span class='text'>1-3, E49)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises &quot;sacred natural love&quot; that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a &quot;creeping skeleton&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Swinburne p</span>
				<span class='text'>260&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the &quot;pale religious letchery&quot; of advocates of traditional norms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, p</span>
				<span class='text'>249</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844–1929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,&lt;ref&gt;Berger pp</span>
				<span class='text'>188–190&lt;/ref&gt; the former being the true measure of purity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Irene Langridge notes that &quot;in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>11, 131</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Davis, p</span>
				<span class='text'>55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human &quot;fallenness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;S</span>
				<span class='text'>Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p</span>
				<span class='text'>105</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p</span>
				<span class='text'>57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy</span>
				<span class='text'>Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berger, p</span>
				<span class='text'>142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some scholars have noted that Blake's views on &quot;free love&quot; are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years</span>
				<span class='text'>Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''</span>
				<span class='text'>Magnus Ankarsjö notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying &quot;Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Ankarsjö on p</span>
				<span class='text'>68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''&lt;/ref&gt; Ankarsjö also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life</span>
				<span class='text'>In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsjö thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsjö, p</span>
				<span class='text'>129</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ankarsjö, p</span>
				<span class='text'>64&lt;/ref&gt; Ankarsjö records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;David Worrall, &quot;Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject&quot;, in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds</span>

				<span class='text'>London: Continuum, 2006, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17–29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Blake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of &quot;self-denial&quot;, though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake</span>
				<span class='text'>Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>112, 284&lt;/ref&gt; and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self</span>
				<span class='text'>Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships</span>

				<span class='text'>His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''</span>

				<span class='text'>5, E36)In ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;If he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,He'd have done anything to please us:Gone sneaking into SynagoguesAnd not us'd the Elders &amp; Priests like Dogs,But humble as a Lamb or Ass,Obey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>od wants not Man to Humble himself (55–61, E519–20)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jesus, for Blake, symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: &quot;All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel</span>

				<span class='text'>Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber</span>

				<span class='text'>]Blake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten when [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s</span>
				<span class='text'>The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the twentieth century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased</span>

				<span class='text'>hile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists</span>
				<span class='text'>[[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Hazard Adams</span>
				<span class='text'>''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work &quot;[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]&quot;) and ''[[The Tyger]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>any such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Jung's own words: &quot;Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies</span>
