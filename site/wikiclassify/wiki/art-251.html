				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|left|[[Rowena Morrill]]'s portrait of Asimov enthroned with symbols of his life's work]]{{Robotic laws}}Asimov's career can be divided into several periods</span>
				<span class='text'>His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series</span>
				<span class='text'>There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Asimov | first = Isaac | title = Prelude to Foundation | publisher=Bantam Books | date = 1988 | pages = xiii–xv | nopp = true | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;Asimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his &quot;[[Three Laws of Robotics]]&quot; and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]] (see ''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;329)</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing the words '[[positronic brain|positronic]]' (an entirely fictional technology), '[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]' (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations) and '[[robotics]]' into the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>Asimov coined the term 'robotics' without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his word 'psychohistory', the word 'robotics' continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with &quot;[[positronic brain]]s&quot;, giving Asimov credit for conceiving this fictional technology</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!-- Not &quot;inventing&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Campbell]] two days later</span>
				<span class='text'>Campbell rejected &quot;Cosmic Corkscrew&quot;, but encouraged Asimov to keep trying, and Asimov did</span>
				<span class='text'>In October, he sold the third story he finished,&lt;!--source does not cover that part--&gt; &quot;[[Marooned Off Vesta]]&quot;, to ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', then a monthly sci-fi magazine edited by [[Raymond A</span>

				<span class='text'>Asimov, there's a story I think you wrote, whose title I can't remember—' at which point I interrupted to tell him it was &quot;The Last Question&quot; and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after</span>
				<span class='text'>I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}}}In December 1974, former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[Paul McCartney]] approached Asimov and asked him if he could write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical</span>
				<span class='text'>McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials</span>
				<span class='text'>The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career</span>
				<span class='text'>Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a &quot;treatment&quot; or brief outline of the story</span>
				<span class='text'>He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story</span>
				<span class='text'>The treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Beginning in 1977, Asimov lent his name to ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' (now ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'') and penned an editorial for each issue</span>
				<span class='text'>There was also a short-lived ''[[Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine]]'' and a companion ''Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology'' reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as the stablemates ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'s'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'s'' &quot;anthologies&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}=== Popular science ===During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov shifted gears somewhat, and substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' and 1982's ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', two of which were mysteries)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he greatly increased his nonfiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 engendered public concern over a &quot;science gap&quot;, which Asimov's publishers were eager to fill with as much material as he could write</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Meanwhile, the monthly ''[[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' invited him to continue his regular nonfiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine]]'', ostensibly dedicated to [[popular science]], but with Asimov having complete editorial freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of the ''F&amp;SF'' columns appeared in November 1958, and they followed uninterrupted thereafter, with 399 entries, until Asimov's terminal illness</span>
				<span class='text'>These columns, periodically collected into books by his principal publisher, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], helped make Asimov's reputation as a &quot;Great Explainer&quot; of science, and were referred to by him as his only pop-science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects at hand on the part of his readers</span>
				<span class='text'>The popularity of his first wide-ranging reference work, ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science]]'', which was nominated for a [[National Book Award]], also allowed him to give up most of his academic responsibilities and become essentially a full-time [[freelance writer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Asimov wrote several essays on the social contentions of his time, including &quot;Thinking About Thinking&quot; and &quot;Science: Knock Plastic&quot; (1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}The great variety of information covered in Asimov's writings once prompted [[Kurt Vonnegut]] to ask, &quot;How does it feel to know everything?&quot; Asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the 'reputation' of omniscience—&quot;Uneasy&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C</span>
				<span class='text'>Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called &quot;Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]&quot;, put together as they shared a cab ride in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself)</span>

				<span class='text'>It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942–1944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, most notably ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965), ''The Roman Republic'' (1966), ''The Roman Empire'' (1967), ''The Egyptians'' (1967) and ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}He published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes—covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969— and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970), ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Asimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''</span>
				<span class='text'>He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing &quot;pure&quot; mysteries</span>
				<span class='text'>He only published two full-length mystery novels, but wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle</span>
				<span class='text'>He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends</span>

				<span class='text'>''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks</span>
				<span class='text'>Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of &quot;George&quot; and his friend Azazel</span>
				<span class='text'>Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Particularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by &quot;J&quot;) and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by &quot;M&quot;), Asimov published ''The Sensuous Dirty Old Man'' under the byline &quot;Dr</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Asimov published two volumes of autobiography: ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' (1979) and ''[[In Joy Still Felt]]'' (1980)</span>
				<span class='text'>A third autobiography, ''I</span>
				<span class='text'>Asimov: A Memoir'', was published in April 1994</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[It's Been a Good Life]]'' (2002), edited by Janet, is a condensed version of his three autobiographies</span>
				<span class='text'>He also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing, ''[[Opus 100]]'' (1969), ''[[Opus 200]]'' (1979), and ''Opus 300'' (1984)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}In 1987, the Asimovs co-wrote ''How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort''</span>

				<span class='text'>The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Asimov and ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] developed a unique relationship during ''Star Trek's'' initial launch in the late 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek's'' scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series</span>

				<span class='text'>= Writing style ===== Characteristics ===One of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':{{quote|Except for two stories—&quot;[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]&quot; and &quot;[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]&quot;—they are not stories in which character plays a significant part</span>
				<span class='text'>Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind</span>
				<span class='text'>The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction—play themselves on a relatively bare stage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;IASFM-Gunn&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Gunn | first = James | author-link = James Gunn (author) | title = On Variations on a Robot | periodical = Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine | date = July 1980 | pages = 56–81 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Gunn observes places where Asimov's style rises to the demands of the situation; he cites the climax of &quot;Liar!&quot; as an example</span>
				<span class='text'>Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in &quot;Liar!&quot; and &quot;Evidence&quot;, [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels</span>
				<span class='text'>Asimov addresses this criticism at the beginning of his book ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing—to be 'clear'</span>
				<span class='text'>I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize</span>
				<span class='text'>I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics—Well, they can do whatever they wish</span>

				<span class='text'>Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}}}In fairness, Gunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both take the stand that a clear, direct prose style is still a style</span>
				<span class='text'>Gunn's 1982 book goes into considerable depth commenting upon each of Asimov's novels published to that date</span>
				<span class='text'>He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but he does call some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' &quot;reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}Although he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}}=== Limitations ===Asimov was sometimes criticized for the general absence of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and of [[extraterrestrial life]] in his science fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]''{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} to respond to these criticisms, which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and mostly British) writers</span>
				<span class='text'>The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted</span>
				<span class='text'>Alien lifeAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans</span>

				<span class='text'>The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (&quot;Gregory Laborian&quot;) for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2014}};Gender and social issuesOthers have criticized him for a lack of strong female characters in his early work</span>
				<span class='text'>In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (&quot;Women and Science Fiction&quot;), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience</span>
				<span class='text'>His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early SF stories, brought this matter to a wider audience</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;Book World&quot; section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are</span>
				<span class='text'>His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R</span>
				<span class='text'>Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly</span>
				<span class='text'>}''The Naked Sun'' (1957) deals with [[social issue]]s as a core part of its central setting and motivation, depicts genetic engineering in the guise of [[eugenics]] as a fundamental part of that society, and presents the reader with inverted arcologies where a single person is the focal point of the artificial environment, as well as a hero who hails from a &quot;normal&quot; [[arcology]] on Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, totally artificial birth, although not specifically cloning, is the aim of the leaders of the society, sexual want is the major driving force of the main female character (albeit veiled in 1950s sensibilities), and the entire story is used to make the point that too much order is ultimately a stagnant dead end to be avoided</span>

				<span class='text'>It took me a long time to say it</span>
