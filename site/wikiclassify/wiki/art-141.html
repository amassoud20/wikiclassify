				<span class='text'>The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents in order to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling</span>

				<span class='text'>His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with producer [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Accompanied by guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], Presley was an early popularizer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed the singer for more than two decades</span>
				<span class='text'>Presley's first RCA single, &quot;[[Heartbreak Hotel]]&quot;, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He was regarded as the leading figure of [[rock and roll]] after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records</span>
				<span class='text'>His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights Movement]], made him enormously popular—and controversial</span>
				<span class='text'>n November 1956, he made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1958, he was drafted into military service</span>
				<span class='text'>He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}}In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his instructors regarded him as &quot;average&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15–16}} He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of [[Red Foley]]'s [[country music|country]] song &quot;[[Old Shep]]&quot; during morning prayers</span>
				<span class='text'>The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance: dressed as a cowboy, the ten-year-old Presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang &quot;Old Shep&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He recalled placing fifth</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17–18}} A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}Entering a new school, Milam, for sixth grade in September 1946, Presley was regarded as a loner</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19–21}} When his protégé was 12 years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances</span>

				<span class='text'>When his music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, &quot;Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me&quot;, in an effort to prove otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>A classmate later recalled that the teacher &quot;agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a &quot;mama's boy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35–38}} In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior</span>
				<span class='text'>They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny Burnette]]—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=20}} Other jobs followed, including Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=43, 44, 49}}During his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline</span>
				<span class='text'>On his own time, he would head down to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis's thriving [[blues]] scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of [[Lansky Brothers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By his senior year, he was wearing them</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual &quot;Minstrel&quot; show in April 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>Singing and playing guitar, he opened with &quot;[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]&quot;, a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46–48, 358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He would later claim that he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he &quot;sounded like&quot;, although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store</span>

				<span class='text'>Asked by receptionist [[Marion Keisker]] what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, &quot;I sing all kinds</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, &quot;I don't sound like nobody</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; After he recorded, Sun boss [[Sam Phillips]] asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: &quot;Good ballad singer</span>

				<span class='text'>Presley at first insisted on pursuing more serious roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the 27 films he made during the 1960s, there were few further exceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a &quot;pantheon of bad taste&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine of them, declared, &quot;A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Fields|2007}}Of Presley's films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs</span>
				<span class='text'>The films' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: &quot;three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew &quot;progressively worse&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be &quot;written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}} Regardless of the songs' quality, it has been argued that Presley generally sang them well, with commitment</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=66}} Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: &quot;Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and '[[Rock-A-Hula Baby|Rock-a-Hula Baby]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums hit number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as &quot;[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]&quot; (1961) and &quot;[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]&quot; (1962)</span>
				<span class='text'>(&quot;[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]&quot;, the title track to the 1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later</span>
				<span class='text'> But, as with artistic merit, the commercial returns steadily diminished</span>
				<span class='text'>During a five-year span—1964 through 1968—Presley had only one top-ten hit: &quot;[[Crying in the Chapel]]&quot; (1965), a gospel number recorded back in 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967)</span>
				<span class='text'>It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance</span>
				<span class='text'>As Marsh described, Presley was &quot;arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock &amp; roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261–63}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;By then, of course, the damage had been done&quot;, as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it</span>

				<span class='text'>Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings in 1954 at the age of 19</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}}At RCA, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard &quot;[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]&quot; at Sun to the country ballad &quot;How's the World Treating You?&quot; on his second LP to the blues of &quot;Santa Claus Is Back In Town&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''Peace in the Valley''</span>

				<span class='text'>His first post-Army single, the number one hit &quot;[[Stuck on You (Elvis Presley song)|Stuck on You]]&quot;, is typical of this shift</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The modern blues/R&amp;B sound captured so successfully on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as &quot;Down in the Alley&quot; and &quot;[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} The singer's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as &quot;[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight?]]&quot;, a number one in 1960</span>
				<span class='text'>While that was a dramatic number, most of what Presley recorded for his film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142–43}}While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was &quot;Burning Love&quot;, his last major hit on the pop charts</span>
				<span class='text'>Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations</span>
				<span class='text'>His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of ''Elvis In Memphis'', as well as &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, cut at the same sessions, reflected his new rock and soul fusion</span>
				<span class='text'>In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}===Vocal style and range===Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that &quot;Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An extraordinary compass&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, &quot;from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat</span>
				<span class='text'>Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was &quot;variable and unpredictable&quot; at the bottom, &quot;often brilliant&quot; at the top, with the capacity for &quot;full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|A]]s that an opera baritone might envy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as 2¼ octaves, emphasizes that &quot;his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear</span>
				<span class='text'>His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in [[decibel]]s; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always &quot;able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers,&quot; writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}==Racial issues==When Dewey Phillips first aired &quot;That's All Right&quot; on Memphis radio, many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–01}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South</span>
				<span class='text'>Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]—the originator of &quot;That's All Right&quot;—&quot;bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, &quot;the rock 'n' roll phenomenon&quot;, &quot;cracked Memphis's segregation laws&quot; by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its &quot;colored night&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} By contrast, many white adults, according to ''Billboard''{{'}}s Arnold Shaw, &quot;did not like him, and condemned him as depraved</span>
				<span class='text'>Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Denisoff|1975|p=22}}Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had at some point announced, &quot;The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes</span>
