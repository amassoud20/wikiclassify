				<span class='text'>Against Marx's &quot;[[historical materialism]]&quot;, Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The ''Protestant Ethic'' formed the earliest part in Weber's broader investigations into world religion; he went on to examine the [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|religions of China]], the [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism|religions of India]] and [[Ancient Judaism (book)|ancient Judaism]], with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of [[social stratification]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Ref label|a|a|none}}In another major work, ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'', Weber defined the [[State (polity)|state]] as an entity that successfully claims a &quot;[[monopoly on violence|monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force]] within a given territory&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms, which he labelled as charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal</span>
				<span class='text'>His analysis of [[bureaucracy]] emphasised that modern state institutions are increasingly based on [[rational-legal authority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eber also made a variety of other contributions in [[economic history]], as well as economic theory and methodology</span>
				<span class='text'>Weber's analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the [[First World War]], Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Max Weber and German Politics, 1890–1920&quot;/&gt; In 1890 the ''Verein'' established a research program to examine &quot;the Polish question&quot; or ''[[Ostflucht]]'': the influx of Polish farm workers into [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern Germany]] as local labourers migrated to Germany's rapidly [[industrialization|industrialising]] cities</span>

				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; From 1893 to 1899 Weber was a member of the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'' (Pan-German League), an organization that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers; the degree of Weber's support for the [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation of Poles]] and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars</span>

				<span class='text'>The model tries to explain bureaucracy from a rational point of view via nine (9) main characteristics or principles; these are as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibrahim, 2012&quot;&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 978-967-349-233-6&lt;/ref&gt;===Max Weber's Bureaucratic Model (Legal-Rational Model)===Weber wrote that the modern bureaucracy in both the public and private sector relies on the following principles</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;First, it is based on the general principle of precisely defined and organized across-the-board competencies of the various offices</span>
				<span class='text'> These competencies are underpinned by rules, laws, or administrative regulations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015:76, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;  For Weber, this means&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015:76 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;#  A rigid division of labor is established which clearly identifies the regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system</span>
				<span class='text'>  There are firmly established chains of command, and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply is described by regulation</span>
				<span class='text'>  Regular and continuous execution of the assigned duties is undertaken by hiring people with particular qualifications which are certified</span>
				<span class='text'>eber notes that these three aspects &quot;constitute the essence of bureaucratic administration</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n the public sector</span>
				<span class='text'> In the private sector, these three aspects constitute the essence of a bureaucratic management of a private company</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015:76-77 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;Main Principles (Characteristics):# Specialized roles</span>
				<span class='text'> Recruitment based on merit (e</span>

				<span class='text'> Uniform principles of placement, promotion, and transfer in an administrative system</span>

				<span class='text'>erits: Max Weber himself noted, real bureaucracy will be less optimal and effective than his ideal type model</span>
				<span class='text'>Each of Weber's principles can degenerate, more so, when it is utilized to analyze the individual level in the organization</span>
				<span class='text'>But when implemented in a group setting in organizational, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regards to better output</span>
				<span class='text'>This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasis on qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline</span>

				<span class='text'>163</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Demerits: However, competencies, efficiency and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory especially when dealing with oversimplified matters</span>
				<span class='text'>In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, employees can sometimes feel that they are not part of the organization's work vision and missions</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside, in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ibrahim, 2012&quot;/&gt;===Inspirations===Weber's thinking was strongly influenced by [[German idealism]] and particularly by [[neo-Kantianism]], to which he had been exposed through [[Heinrich Rickert]], his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford</span>
				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way in which the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford</span>
				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist [[Georg Simmel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Frisby |title=Georg Simmel |series=Key Sociologists |edition=Second |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-28535-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Weber was also influenced by [[Kantian ethics]], which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties</span>
				<span class='text'>In this last respect, the influence of [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy]] is evident</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford</span>
				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', the &quot;deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford</span>
				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt; Another major influence in Weber's life was the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics</span>
				<span class='text'>While Weber shares some of Marx's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy, Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-166&quot;/&gt; Weber's position was close to [[historicism]], as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002-166&quot;/&gt; Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of [[comparative history|comparative historical analysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-153&quot;/&gt; Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-148&quot;/&gt;===Rationalisation===Many scholars have described [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] and the question of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-148&quot;/&gt;By rationalisation, Weber understood first, the individual cost-benefit calculation, second, the wider, bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and finally, in the more general sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic ([[disenchantment]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-151&quot;/&gt;{{quote|The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the &quot;disenchantment of the world&quot;|Max Weber&lt;ref name=&quot;Koshul2005&quot;/&gt;}}Weber began his studies of the subject in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in [[ascetic]] [[Protestant]] [[Religious denomination|denominations]], particularly [[Calvinism]], shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-162&quot;/&gt; In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of [[calling (religious)|calling]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-162&quot;/&gt; The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded</span>

				<span class='text'>du&quot;/&gt;}}===Sociology of religion===Weber's work in the field of [[sociology of religion]] started with the essay ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and continued with the analysis of ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His work on other religions was interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following ''Ancient Judaism'' with studies of early Christianity and Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix285&quot;/&gt; His three main themes in the essays were the effect of religious ideas on economic activities, the relation between [[social stratification]] and religious ideas and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BendixChapter9&quot;/&gt;Weber saw religion as one of the core forces in the society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-153&quot;/&gt; His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the [[Western world|Occident]] and the [[Orient]], although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the [[Western culture|Western civilisation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BendixChapter9&quot;/&gt; In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that [[Calvinist]] (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the [[social innovation]] and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development</span>
				<span class='text'>Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the [[rationalism]] of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BendixChapter9&quot;/&gt; In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or what he referred to as &quot;[[disenchantment]] of the world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BendixChapter9&quot;/&gt;Weber also proposed a [[socioevolutionary]] model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to [[polytheism]], then to [[pantheism]], [[monotheism]] and finally, [[ethical monotheism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-154&quot;/&gt; According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed [[professionalisation]] and the evolution of ever more sophisticated [[priesthood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-155&quot;/&gt; As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Cover of a German edition of ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]Weber's essay ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' is his most famous work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EESoc-22&quot;/&gt; It is argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the [[economic system]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt; In ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', Weber put forward the thesis that [[Calvinism|Calvinist ethic]] and ideas influenced the development of capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt; He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt; Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]] elsewhere in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt;{{quote|The development of the concept of the calling quickly gave to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience&amp;nbsp;– and also industrious workers; he gave to his employees as the wages of their ascetic devotion to the calling and of co-operation in his ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect of eternal salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>Max Weber&lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-162&quot;/&gt;}}Christian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix57&quot;/&gt; Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism&amp;nbsp;– notably [[Calvinism]]&amp;nbsp;– were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix60&quot;/&gt; Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix54&quot;/&gt; In particular, the [[Protestant ethic]] (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt; The notion of [[Calling (religious)|calling]] meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation; just being a member of the Church was not enough</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-162&quot;/&gt; [[Predestination]] also reduced agonising over [[economic inequality]] and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of [[salvation]] in the afterlife</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-37-38&quot;/&gt; The believers thus justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt; This Weber called the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot;: it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind&amp;nbsp;– and inevitably led to&amp;nbsp;– the capitalist economic system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-35-37&quot;/&gt; This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the [[base and superstructure|economic &quot;base&quot;]] of society determines all other aspects of it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix60&quot;/&gt;Weber abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on the book ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''</span>
				<span class='text'>Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying the groundwork for a comparative analysis of religion and society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix49&quot;/&gt;The phrase &quot;[[Protestant work ethic|work ethic]]&quot; used in modern commentary is a derivative of the &quot;[[Protestant ethic]]&quot; discussed by Weber</span>
				<span class='text'>It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people, Jews and other non-Christians and thus lost its religious connotations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SwedbergAgevall2005&quot;/&gt;====''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism''===={{Main|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism}}''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism'' was Weber's second major work on the sociology of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>Hans H</span>
				<span class='text'>Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C</span>
				<span class='text'>K</span>
				<span class='text'>Wang</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Religion of China'', New York: Free Press, 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with [[Puritanism#Beliefs|Puritanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix98&quot;/&gt; He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese [[patrimonialism]] and [[officialdom]] and [[religion in China|Chinese religion]] and [[philosophy in China|philosophy]] (primarily, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix98&quot;/&gt;According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational thought]], each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix135&quot;/&gt; Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix135&quot;/&gt; However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-37-38&quot;/&gt; Confucianism's goal was &quot;a cultured status position&quot;, while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are &quot;tools of God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix135&quot;/&gt; The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix135&quot;/&gt; Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-37-38&quot;/&gt; Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix135&quot;/&gt;====''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism''===={{Main|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism}}''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix142&quot;/&gt; Like Confucianism in China, for Weber, Hinduism in India was a barrier for capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-37-38&quot;/&gt; The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-37-38&quot;/&gt; Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-37-38&quot;/&gt;Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|his previous work on China]] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix199&quot;/&gt; He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldly [[mysticism|mystical]] experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix199&quot;/&gt; The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a [[prophet]] or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix199&quot;/&gt; In Asia, there was no [[Messianic prophecy]] to give ''plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix199&quot;/&gt; Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (also called [[ethical prophecy|ethical prophecies]]), notably from the [[Near East]] region to the [[exemplary prophecy|exemplary prophecies]] found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix199&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix90&quot;/&gt; It was those differences that prevented the countries of the [[Western world|Occident]] from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations</span>
				<span class='text'>His next work, [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]] was an attempt to prove this theory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix199&quot;/&gt;====''Ancient Judaism''===={{Main|Ancient Judaism (book)}}In ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'', his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between [[Oriental]] and [[Western culture|Occidental]] [[religiosity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix200&quot;/&gt; He contrasted the innerworldly [[asceticism]] developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix200&quot;/&gt; Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix200&quot;/&gt; This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish [[prophecy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix204&quot;/&gt;Weber claimed that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occidental state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures</span>
				<span class='text'>eber's premature death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Job]], [[Talmudic]] Jewry, early Christianity and [[Islam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===''Economy and Society''===={{Main|Economy and Society}}In his magnum opus, ''[[Economy and Society]]'', Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of religious attitudes: world-flying mysticism, world-rejecting asceticism, and inner-worldly asceticism</span>

				<span class='text'>publisher=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;The concept of theodicy was expanded mainly with the thought of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>There is this ethical part of religion, including &quot;(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy</span>
				<span class='text'>These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves to be able to be in a ''correct'' relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc|location=New York|isbn=9780742561113|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 7&quot;/&gt; Weber also writes that &quot;the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>while] theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plye, Davidson&quot;/&gt; Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion</span>
				<span class='text'>eber defines the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the two theodicies and to what class structures they apply</span>
				<span class='text'>The concept of &quot;work ethic&quot; is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant &quot;work ethic&quot;, there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc|location=New York|isbn=9780742561113|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife</span>
				<span class='text'>Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Plye, Davidson&quot;/&gt;These two theodicies can be found in the denominational segregation within the religious community</span>
				<span class='text'>The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, mainline churches, with their upper class congregations, &quot;promote[d] order, stability, and conservatism, and in so doing proved to be a powerful source of legitimation of the status quo and of existing disparities in the distribution of wealth and power&quot; because much of the wealth of the church comes from the congregation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc|location=New York|isbn=9780742561113|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Pentecostal churches adopted the theodicy of misfortune</span>
				<span class='text'>They instead &quot;advocated change intended to advance the cause of justice and fairness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137&quot;/&gt; Thus the learned and upper class religious churches who preach the theodicy of fortune, ultimately support capitalism and corporation, while the churches who adopted the theodicy of misfortune, instead preached equality and fairness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;E-PoV&quot;/&gt; A politician must not be a man of the &quot;true Christian ethic&quot;, understood by Weber as being the ethic of the [[Sermon on the Mount]], that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PaV&quot;/&gt; An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a [[saint]], for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PaV&quot;/&gt; The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of ultimate ends and the ethic of responsibility and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PaV&quot;/&gt;Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of political leadership (alternatively referred to as three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibrahim, 2012&quot;/&gt;# [[charismatic domination]] ([[family|familial]] and [[religion and politics|religious]]),# [[traditional domination]] ([[patriarch]]s, [[patriarchy|patrimonialism]], [[feudalism]]) and# [[legal domination]] (modern law and state, [[bureaucracy]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;WolfJM&quot;/&gt;In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of [[tripartite classification of authority|this tripartite distinction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix296&quot;/&gt; He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to &quot;routinise&quot; into a more structured form of authority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-38-42&quot;/&gt; In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a &quot;traditional revolution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The move towards a [[rational-legal]] structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix303&quot;/&gt; Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>This ties to his broader concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction</span>

				<span class='text'>Max Weber&lt;ref name=&quot;Bureaucratic&quot;/&gt;}}Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922)</span>
				<span class='text'>His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-38-42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bureaucratic&quot;/&gt; It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;BuSach&quot;/&gt; Many aspects of modern [[public administration]] go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called &quot;Weberian civil service&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hooghe2001&quot;/&gt; As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2009-38-42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bureaucratic&quot;/&gt;Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy:&lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-172-176&quot;/&gt; The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a [[monetary economy]]&amp;nbsp;– these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-172-176&quot;/&gt; Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and [[democratisation]] and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;AllanAllan2005-172-176&quot;/&gt;Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bendix85&quot;/&gt;===The City===As part of his overarching effort to understand the unique development of the Western world, Weber produced a detailed general study of the city as the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations, political arrangements, and ideas that eventually came to define the West</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in a monograph titled ''[[The City (book)|The City]]'', which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–1913, and which was published posthumously in 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1924 it was incorporated into the second part of his ''[[Economy and Society]]'', as chapter XVI, &quot;The City (Non-legitimate Domination)&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Weber, the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity, employed in a variety of specialised trades, and physically separated from the surrounding countryside, only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution:{{quote|The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets [</span>

				<span class='text'>tm &quot;The German Historical School&quot;], New School for Social Research&lt;/ref&gt;Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism</span>
				<span class='text'>In earlier texts, [[Maximiliano Korstanje]] explores the American exceptionalism and its effects on the current means of productions</span>
				<span class='text'>This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism</span>
				<span class='text'>This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind</span>
				<span class='text'>In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone</span>
				<span class='text'>It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;====Methodological individualism====Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting [[economic history]], Weber's defence of &quot;[[methodological individualism]]&quot; in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by [[Carl Menger]], the founder of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, in the context of the academic ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' (&quot;debate over methods&quot;) of the late 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordIndividualism&quot;/&gt; The phrase &quot;methodological individualism&quot;, which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]], was coined by the Austrian-American economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordIndividualism&quot;/&gt; According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive]] or [[Analytic philosophy|descriptive]], because ''understanding'' some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and ''interpret'' it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract &quot;[[ideal type|ideal (pure) types]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;capa&quot;/&gt; This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see ''[[Verstehen]]''), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the &quot;[[rational economic man]]&quot; (''[[homo economicus]]''), which is at the heart of modern [[mainstream economics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordIndividualism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;capa&quot;/&gt;====Marginalism and psychophysics====Unlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the [[Marginalism|marginal theory of value]] (also called &quot;marginalism&quot;) and taught it to his students</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Swedberg-econ-soc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweitzer&quot;/&gt; In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the [[Weber-Fechner law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of [[psychophysics]] by [[Lionel Robbins]], [[George Stigler]],&lt;ref&gt;George Stigler, [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Economic history====Weber's best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly the relations between religion and capitalism, which he explored in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' as well as in his other works on the [[sociology of religion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;capa&quot;/&gt; He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of [[ancient world|ancient]] capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;capa&quot;/&gt;Although today Weber is primarily read by sociologists and [[Social philosophy|social philosophers]], Weber's work did have a significant influence on [[Frank Knight]], one of the founders of the neoclassical [[Chicago school of economics]], who translated Weber's ''General Economic History'' into English in 1927</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Emmett&quot;/&gt; Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism &quot;from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Schweitzer&quot; /&gt;====Economic calculation====Weber, like his colleague [[Werner Sombart]], regarded [[Cost-benefit analysis|economic calculation]] and especially the [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]] method of business accounting, as one of the most important forms of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] associated the development of modern capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;SwedbergAgevall2005-22&quot;/&gt; Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tribe&quot;/&gt; Socialist intellectuals like [[Otto Neurath]] had realised that in a completely socialised economy, [[price]]s would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) [[economic calculation problem|economic calculation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tribe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordNeurathSup&quot;/&gt; According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of [[Imputation (economics)|imputation]] (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>of accurately determining the relative values of [[capital good]]s)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tribe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordNeurathSup&quot;/&gt; Weber wrote that, under full socialism,{{quote|In order to make possible a rational utilisation of the means of production, a system of in-kind accounting would have to determine &quot;value&quot;&amp;nbsp;– indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the &quot;prices&quot; used in book valuation in modern business accounting</span>
				<span class='text'>But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular, verified; whether, for instance, they should vary from one production unit to the next (on the basis of economic location), or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy, on the basis of &quot;social utility&quot;, that is, of (present and future) consumption requirements [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Nothing is gained by assuming that, if only the problem of a non-monetary economy were seriously enough attacked, a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation</span>
				<span class='text'>We cannot speak of a rational &quot;planned economy&quot; so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational &quot;plan&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Max Weber&lt;ref name=&quot;EconSoc-calculation&quot;/&gt;}}This argument against socialism was made independently, at about the same time, by [[Ludwig von Mises]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tribe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hulsmann&quot;/&gt; Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises-Weber&quot;/&gt; and, through Mises, on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Haberler&quot;/&gt; [[Friedrich Hayek]] in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics's intellectual assault on socialism, as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of &quot;[[dispersed knowledge]]&quot; in markets</span>
