				<span class='text'>1513 – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish clergyman, [[Christian theology|theologian]], and writer who was a leader of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and is considered the founder of the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denomination in [[Scotland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is believed to have been educated at the [[University of St Andrews]] and worked as a notary-priest</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by early church reformers such as [[George Wishart]], he joined the movement to reform the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Scottish church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of [[David Cardinal Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] in 1546 and the intervention of the [[regent]] of Scotland [[Mary of Guise]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549</span>
				<span class='text'>hile in exile, Knox was licensed to work in the [[Church of England]], where he rose in the ranks to serve [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI of England]] as a royal chaplain</span>
				<span class='text'>He exerted a reforming influence on the text of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In England he met and married his first wife, Margery Bowes</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] ascended the throne and re-established Roman Catholicism, Knox was forced to resign his position and leave the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox moved to [[Geneva]] and then to [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Geneva he met [[John Calvin]], from whom he gained experience and knowledge of [[Reformed theology]] and [[Presbyterian polity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He created a new order of service, which was eventually adopted by the reformed church in Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Geneva to head the [[Marian exiles|English refugee]] church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], thus ending his association with the Church of England</span>
				<span class='text'>n his return to Scotland he led the [[Scottish Reformation|Protestant Reformation in Scotland]], in partnership with the Scottish Protestant [[Scottish nobility|nobility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox helped write the new [[Scots Confession|confession of faith]] and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, [[Church of Scotland|the Kirk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign</span>
				<span class='text'>In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices</span>
				<span class='text'>When she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], and [[James I of England|King James VI]] enthroned in her stead, he openly called for her execution</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to preach until his final days</span>

				<span class='text'>Until [[David Hay Fleming]] published new research in 1904, John Knox was thought to have been born in 1505</span>
				<span class='text'>Hay Fleming's conclusion was that Knox was born between 1513 and 1515</span>
				<span class='text'>Sources using this date include {{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=13}} and {{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=15}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Ridley notes additional research supports the later date which is now generally accepted by historians</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their eldest son, William, carried on his father's business, which helped in Knox's international communications</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson 2015 14, 150&quot;/&gt;Knox was probably educated at the grammar school in Haddington</span>
				<span class='text'>In this time, the priesthood was the only path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to further studies at the [[University of St Andrews]] or possibly at the [[University of Glasgow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He studied under [[John Mair|John Major]], one of the greatest scholars of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=229–231}}</span>
				<span class='text'>According to MacGregor, there is a &quot;John Knox&quot; recorded to have enrolled at the University of Glasgow in 1522</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the name John Knox was quite common, and the identification of the Glasgow student as the future reformer cannot be made with certainty</span>
				<span class='text'>John Major was known to have taught at the University of Glasgow and later at the University of St Andrews</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the birth date calculated by Hay Fleming, he would have been too young to have attended Glasgow at the time when Major was teaching there</span>
				<span class='text'>The time when Major was teaching at St Andrews is consistent both with Knox being of university age and with a statement made by [[Theodore Beza]] that Knox was taught by Major at St Andrews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Knox first appears in public records as a priest and a [[Notary public|notary]] in 1540</span>
				<span class='text'>He was still serving in these capacities as late as 1543 when he described himself as a &quot;minister of the sacred altar in the diocese of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Andrews, notary by apostolic authority&quot; in a notarial deed dated 27 March</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than taking up parochial duties in a parish, he became [[tutor]] to two sons of Hugh Douglas of [[Longniddry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also taught the son of [[John Cockburn of Ormiston|John Cockburn]] of [[Ormiston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Both of these [[laird]]s had embraced the new religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=31}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>He first moved to England, where in [[Bristol]] he preached against the [[Marian devotions|veneration]] of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in [[effigy]] at the [[St Nicholas, Bristol|Church of St Nicholas]] as a sign of his abjuration</span>
				<span class='text'>He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>While on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], he translated the [[First Helvetic Confession]] into English</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=27}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1543, [[James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault]], the appointed regent for the infant [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had decided with the Queen Mother, [[Mary of Guise]], and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[David Beaton]] to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the reformation and when he arrived in [[East Lothian]], Knox became one of his closest associates</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=29}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=39–40}}; {{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Cardinal Beaton's orders by the [[Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] and taken to the [[St Andrews Castle|Castle of St Andrews]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, &quot;Nay, return to your [[bairn]]s [children] and God bless you</span>
				<span class='text'>One is sufficient for a sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, [[Archdeacon]] [[John Lauder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Cardinal Beaton</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Ridley, this portrait is usually thought to be painted from memory by the Flemish painter [[Adrian Vanson]] and sent by [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]], an assistant of [[George Buchanan]], to Beza</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Knox had avoided being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice to return to tutoring</span>
				<span class='text'>He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=34}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later he was still in charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued</span>
				<span class='text'>He toyed with the idea of fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him</span>
				<span class='text'>While Knox remained a fugitive, Cardinal Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution</span>
				<span class='text'>The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all</span>
				<span class='text'>Among their friends was [[Henry Balnaves]], a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=43}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=44–45}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=52}}; {{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;Knox's powers as a preacher came to the attention of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough</span>
				<span class='text'>While Rough was preaching in the [[St Andrews#Parish Church of the Holy Trinity|parish church]] on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox did not relish the idea</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, [[John Mair|John Major]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expounded on the seventh chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]], comparing the Pope with the [[Antichrist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of [[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]], two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], [[Purgatory]], and prayers for the dead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=48–50}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Confinement in the French galleys, 1547–1549==John Knox's chaplaincy of the castle garrison was not to last long</span>
				<span class='text'>While Hamilton was willing to negotiate with England to stop their support of the rebels and bring the castle back under his control, Mary of Guise decided that it could only be taken by force and requested the king of France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] to intervene</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 1547, 21 French [[galley]]s approached St Andrews under the command of [[Leone Strozzi]], [[prior]] of [[Capua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The French [[Siege of St Andrews Castle|besieged the castle]] and forced the surrender of the garrison on 31 July</span>
				<span class='text'>The Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=53–55}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=60–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[galley slaves]] were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sailed to France and navigated up the [[Seine]] to [[Rouen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The nobles, some of whom would have an impact later in Knox's life such as [[William Kirkcaldy]] and Henry Balnaves, were sent to various castle-prisons in France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=55}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=66–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox and the other galley slaves continued to [[Nantes]] and stayed on the [[Loire River|Loire]] throughout the winter</span>
				<span class='text'>They were threatened with torture if they did not give proper signs of reverence when mass was performed on the ship</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox recounted an incident in which one Scot—possibly himself, as he tended to narrate personal anecdotes in the third person—was required to show devotion to a picture of the Virgin Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>The prisoner was told to give it a kiss of [[veneration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He refused and when the picture was pushed up to his face, the prisoner seized the picture and threw it into the sea, saying, &quot;Let our Lady now save herself: she is light enough: let her learn to swim</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, according to Knox, the Scottish prisoners were no longer forced to perform such devotions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;In summer 1548, the galleys returned to Scotland to scout for English ships</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox's health was now at its lowest point due to the severity of his confinement</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ill with a fever and others on the ship were afraid for his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release</span>
				<span class='text'>While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and [[Dundee]], the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view</span>
				<span class='text'>[[James Balfour (Pittendreich)|James Balfour]], a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark</span>
				<span class='text'>He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In February 1549, after spending a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released</span>
				<span class='text'>It is uncertain how he obtained his liberty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=68}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=81}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Reid suggests that some of Knox's friends may have appealed to the King of France</span>
				<span class='text'>Ridley surmises that Knox's health was so poor that he was of no use for the galleys</span>
				<span class='text'>Other theories include {{Harvnb|Guy|2004|p=39}} who claimed Somerset arranged for his release and safe conduct to London</span>
				<span class='text'>Another theory by {{Harvnb|Marshall|2000|p=30}} proposes that Somerset conducted a prisoner exchange that included Knox to get back English military experts captured at St Andrews</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Henry II arranged with [[Edward VI of England]] the release of all remaining Castilian prisoners</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[English Reformation|Reformation in England]] was a less radical movement than its Continental counterparts, but there was a definite breach with Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], and the regent of [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], were decidedly Protestant-minded</span>
				<span class='text'>However, much work remained to bring reformed ideas to the clergy and to the people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=71–74}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1549, Knox was licensed to work in the [[Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first commission was in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was obliged to use the recently released ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which was mainly a translation of the Latin mass into English and was largely left intact and unreformed</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore modified its use along Protestant lines</span>

				<span class='text'>The following year he was appointed one of the six [[Chapel Royal|royal chaplains]] serving the King</span>
				<span class='text'>On 16 October 1551, [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox condemned the ''coup d'état'' in a sermon on [[All Saints Day]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the fire-brand preacher, but he saw Knox as a potential asset</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the second edition of the ''Book of Common Prayer''</span>
				<span class='text'>The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during [[Eucharist|communion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be idolatry</span>
				<span class='text'>It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice</span>
				<span class='text'>The end result was a compromise in which the famous [[Black Rubric]], which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition</span>

				<span class='text'>When Knox arrived Calvin was in a difficult position</span>
				<span class='text'>He had recently prosecuted the execution of the scholar [[Michael Servetus]] for heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox asked Calvin four difficult political questions: whether a minor could rule by divine right, whether a female could rule and transfer sovereignty to her husband, whether people should obey ungodly or idolatrous rulers, and what party godly persons should follow if they resisted an idolatrous ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin gave cautious replies and referred him to the Swiss reformer [[Heinrich Bullinger]] in [[Zürich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bullinger's responses were equally cautious; but Knox had already made up his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 July 1554, he published a pamphlet attacking Mary Tudor and the bishops who had brought her to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|p=111}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=178–188}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The title of the pamphlet is ''A Faithful Admonition unto the Professors of God's Truth in England''&lt;/ref&gt; He also attacked the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], calling him &quot;no less enemy to Christ than was Nero&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;In a letter dated 24 September 1554, Knox received an invitation from a congregation of [[Marian exiles|English exiles]] in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] to become one of their ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing</span>
				<span class='text'>But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version of the ''Book of Common Prayer''</span>
				<span class='text'>More recently arrived refugees, however, including [[Edmund Grindal]], the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>When Knox and a supporting colleague, [[William Whittingham]], wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides</span>
				<span class='text'>This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]], one of the principal authors of the ''Book of Common Prayer''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave</span>
				<span class='text'>His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=123–127}}; {{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;After his return to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the minister at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin</span>
				<span class='text'>In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking him to return to Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=78}}, Elizabeth informed Knox that her husband, Richard, had died</span>
				<span class='text'>According to {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=265–266}}, however, Richard did not die until 1558 and Elizabeth left her husband to go with Margery and Knox</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial doubts about the state of the Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547</span>
				<span class='text'>When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]] and the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (d</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|pp=223–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;Though the Queen Regent, [[Mary of Guise]], made no move to act against Knox, his activities caused concern among the church authorities</span>

				<span class='text'>He preached three sermons a week, each lasting well over two hours</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The church in which he preached, the ''Église de Notre Dame la Neuve''—now known as the [[Auditoire de Calvin]]—had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, for the use of the English and Italian congregations</span>

				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;In the summer of 1558, Knox published his best known pamphlet, ''[[The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In calling the &quot;regiment&quot; or rule of women &quot;monstruous&quot;, he meant that it was &quot;unnatural&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The pamphlet has been called a classic of [[misogyny]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox states that his purpose was to demonstrate &quot;how abominable before God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traiteresse and bastard&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kingdon|1995|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women rulers that Knox had in mind were [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I of England]] and [[Mary of Guise]], the [[Dowager Queen]] of Scotland and regent on behalf of her daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox's prejudices against women were not unusual in his day; however, even he was aware that the pamphlet was dangerously seditious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore published it anonymously and did not tell Calvin, who denied knowledge of it until a year after its publication, that he had written it</span>
				<span class='text'>In England, the pamphlet was officially condemned by royal proclamation</span>
				<span class='text'>The impact of the document was complicated later that year, when [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth Tudor]] became Queen of England</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Knox had not targeted Elizabeth, he had deeply offended her, and she never forgave him</span>

				<span class='text'>Before his departure, various honours were conferred on him, including the freedom of the city of Geneva</span>

				<span class='text'>Knox was declared an outlaw, and the [[Mary of Guise|Queen Regent]] summoned the Protestants to [[Stirling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing the possibility of a summary trial and execution, the Protestants proceeded instead to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege</span>
				<span class='text'>At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon and a small incident precipitated into a riot</span>
				<span class='text'>A mob poured into the church and it was soon gutted</span>
				<span class='text'>The mob then attacked two friaries in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images</span>

				<span class='text'>She dispatched the [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] and [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Lord Moray]] to offer terms and avert a war</span>
				<span class='text'>She promised not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants evacuated the town</span>
				<span class='text'>The Protestants agreed, but when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish soldiers on the French pay roll</span>
				<span class='text'>This was seen as treacherous by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both switched sides and joined Knox, who now based himself in [[St Andrews]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Knox and five other ministers were called upon to draw up a new [[confession of faith]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Within four days, the [[Scots Confession]] was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved</span>
				<span class='text'>A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland</span>

				<span class='text'>Much of this was now in the hands of the nobles, who were reluctant to give up their possessions</span>

				<span class='text'>The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=222–223}}; {{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few details are known of their domestic life</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=208–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;When the General Assembly convened in June 1564, an argument broke out between Knox and Maitland over the authority of the civil government</span>
				<span class='text'>Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from [[Martin Luther]] and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox retorted that the Bible notes that [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the [[Anabaptists]] who rejected all forms of government</span>
				<span class='text'>The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1974|pp=233–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 29 July 1565 when Mary married [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], some of the Protestant nobles, including [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]], rose up in rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox revealed his own objection while preaching in the presence of the new [[King Consort]] on 19 August 1565</span>
				<span class='text'>He made passing allusions on ungodly rulers which caused Darnley to walk out</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox was summoned and prohibited from preaching while the court was in Edinburgh</span>

				<span class='text'>]On 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, [[David Rizzio]], was murdered by conspirators loyal to Darnley</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March returned with a formidable force</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox fled to [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]] in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his ''magnum opus'', ''[[History of the Reformation in Scotland]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Other old friends of Knox's, [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Lord Argyll]] and [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange|William Kirkcaldy]], stood by Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church in [[Stirling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, even to the point of calling for her death</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568</span>

				<span class='text'>Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570</span>
				<span class='text'>The regent who succeeded him, the [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], was also a victim of violence</span>
				<span class='text'>On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, [[Kirkcaldy of Grange]], ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city</span>
				<span class='text'>But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley-slave, he made an exception</span>
				<span class='text'>If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his ''History''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh</span>
				<span class='text'>Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=216–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;After inducting his successor, Lawson of [[Aberdeen]], as minister of St Giles' on 9 November, Knox returned to his home for the last time</span>
				<span class='text'>With his friends and some of the greatest Scottish nobles around him, he asked for the Bible to be read aloud</span>
				<span class='text'>On his last day, 24 November 1572, his young wife read from [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Paul's first letter to the Corinthians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGregor|1957|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; A testimony to Knox was pronounced at his grave in the churchyard of St Giles' by [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]] and newly elected regent of Scotland: &quot;Here lies one who never feared any flesh&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The regent, Lord Morton, asked the General Assembly to continue paying his [[stipend]] to his widow for one year after his death, and the regent ensured that Knox's dependents were decently supported</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor226&quot;/&gt;Knox was survived by his five children and his second wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Nathaniel and Eleazar, his two sons by his first wife, attended [[St John's College, Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nathaniel became a Fellow of St John's but died early in 1580</span>
				<span class='text'>Eleazar was ordained into the [[Church of England]] and served in the parish of [[Great Clacton|Clacton Magna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also died young, and was buried in the chapel of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] in 1591</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;(Dawson, 2015, p 311)&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's second wife, Margaret Stewart, got remarried to Andrew Ker, one of those involved in the murder of David Rizzio</span>
				<span class='text'>Knox's three daughters also married: Martha to Alexander Fairlie; Margaret to Zachary Pont, son of [[Robert Pont (Scottish politician)|Robert Pont]] and brother of [[Timothy Pont]]; and Elizabeth to [[John Welsh of Ayr|John Welsh]], a minister of the Kirk</span>

				<span class='text'>Although his funeral was attended by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters</span>

				<span class='text'>He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary and it was this revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English [[Puritans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ridley 1968 522–523, 527, 529–530&quot;/&gt;Knox was notable not so much for the overthrow of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring the replacement of the papal religion with [[Presbyterianism]] rather than [[Anglicanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was thanks to Knox that the Presbyterian polity was established,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridley|1968|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the protestant [[Archbishop of St Andrews]] [[John Douglas (archbishop of St Andrews)|John Douglas]] in 1571</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;(Dawson, 2015, p 301)&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide</span>
