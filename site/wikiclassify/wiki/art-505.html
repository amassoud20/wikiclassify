				<span class='text'>He was born in [[Scania]], then part of Denmark, now part of modern-day Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[astrologer]] and [[alchemy|alchemist]], and has been described more recently as &quot;the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact empirical facts</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Arthur Burtt]], ''[[wikiquote:The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science|The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science]]; a Historical and Critical Essay'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;In his ''De nova stella'' (On the new star) of 1573, he refuted the [[Aristotelian physics#celestial unchanging|Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His precise measurements indicated that &quot;new stars,&quot; (stellae [[nova]]e, now known as [[supernova]]e) in particular [[SN 1572|that of 1572]], lacked the [[parallax]] expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore not tailless [[Comet#History of study|comets]] in the atmosphere as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon</span>
				<span class='text'>Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly immutable [[celestial spheres]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Blind Watchers of the Sky, p</span>
				<span class='text'>19-42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the [[geometry|geometrical]] benefits of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] with the philosophical benefits of the [[Ptolemaic system]] into his own model of the universe, the [[Tychonic system]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, he was the last of the major [[naked eye]] astronomers, working without [[telescope]]s for his observations</span>
				<span class='text'>ycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hven]] and the funding to build [[Uraniborg]], an early [[research institute]], where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later [[Stjerneborg]], underground, when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady</span>
				<span class='text'>On the island (where he behaved autocratically toward the residents) he founded manufactories such as a [[paper mill]] to provide material for printing his results</span>
				<span class='text'>fter disagreements with the new Danish king Christian IV in 1597, he was invited by the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] king and [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] emperor [[Rudolph II]] to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer</span>
				<span class='text'>He built the new observatory at [[Benátky nad Jizerou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by [[Johannes Kepler]] who later used Tycho's astronomical data to develop [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|his three laws of planetary motion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>is body has been exhumed twice, in 1901 and 2010, to examine the circumstances of his death and to verify what material his artificial nose was made of</span>
				<span class='text'>The conclusion was that his death was likely caused by a burst bladder as first suggested and that the artificial nose was more likely made of brass than silver or gold as believed in his time</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life=====Early years===Tycho was born at his family's ancestral seat of [[Knutstorp Castle]] (Danish: ''Knudstrup borg''; Swedish: ''Knutstorps borg''),&lt;ref&gt;Bricka 1888, p</span>

				<span class='text'>His [[twin]] brother died before being [[baptized]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho wrote a Latin ode to his dead twin,&lt;ref&gt;Wittendorff 1994, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; which was printed in 1572 as his first published work</span>
				<span class='text'>He also had two sisters, one older (Kirstine Brahe) and one younger ([[Sophia Brahe]])</span>
				<span class='text'>tte Brahe, Tycho's father, was a [[nobleman]] and an important figure at the court of the Danish king</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Beate Bille, came from an important family that had produced leading churchmen and politicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Both parents are buried under the floor of [[Kågeröd|Kågeröd Church]], four kilometres east of Knutstorp</span>
				<span class='text'>An [[epitaph]], originally from Knutstorp, but now on a plaque near the church door, shows the whole family, including Tycho as a boy</span>
				<span class='text'>ycho later wrote that when he was around age two, his uncle, Danish nobleman [[Jørgen Thygesen Brahe]], &quot;without the knowledge of my parents took me away with him while I was in my earliest youth to become a scholar&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>It is also thought he may have been taught by a private tutor between these ages</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 12, on 19 April 1559, Tycho began studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, following his uncle's wishes, he studied law, but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in [[astronomy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>07&lt;/ref&gt; so impressed him that he began to make his own studies of astronomy, helped by some of the professors</span>
				<span class='text'>He purchased an [[ephemeris]] and books on astronomy, including [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]'s ''[[De sphaera mundi]]'', [[Petrus Apianus]]'s ''Cosmographia seu descriptio totius orbis'' and [[Regiomontanus]]'s ''De triangulis omnimodis''</span>
				<span class='text'>Jørgen Thygesen Brahe, however, wanted Tycho to educate himself in order to become a civil servant, and sent him on a study tour of Europe in early 1562</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho was given the 19-year-old [[Anders Sørensen Vedel]] as mentor, whom he eventually talked into allowing the pursuit of astronomy during the tour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bricka 1888, p</span>
				<span class='text'>08&lt;/ref&gt;Tycho realized that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable</span>
				<span class='text'>This program became his life's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho improved and enlarged existing instruments, and built entirely new ones</span>
				<span class='text'>His sister Sophia assisted Tycho in many of his measurements</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a [[telescope]], soon to be turned skyward by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and others</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Star map of the constellation Cassiopeia showing the position of the supernova of 1572 (the topmost star, labelled ''I''); from Tycho Brahe's ''De nova stella'']]On 11 November 1572, Tycho observed (from [[Herrevad Abbey]]) a very bright star, now named [[SN 1572]], which had unexpectedly appeared in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because it had been maintained since [[Ancient history|antiquity]] that the world beyond the Moon's orbit was eternally unchangeable (celestial immutability was a fundamental axiom of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] world-view), other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the terrestrial sphere below the Moon</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in the first instance Tycho observed that the object showed no daily [[parallax]] against the background of the fixed stars</span>
				<span class='text'>This implied it was at least farther away than the Moon and those planets that do show such parallax</span>
				<span class='text'>He also found the object did not change its position relative to the fixed stars over several months as all planets did in their periodic orbital motions, even the outer planets for which no daily parallax was detectable</span>
				<span class='text'>This suggested it was not even a planet, but a fixed star in the stellar sphere beyond all the planets</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1573 he published a small book, ''De nova stella''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|[[Valentin Naboth]]'s drawing of [[Martianus Capella]]'s geo-heliocentric astronomical model (1573)]]Tycho was not a Copernican, but proposed a &quot;geo-heliocentric&quot; system in which the [[Sun]] and Moon orbited the [[Earth]], while the other planets orbited the [[Sun]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His system provided a safe position for astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models but were reluctant to accept the Earth's motion</span>
				<span class='text'>It gained a considerable following after 1616 when Rome decided officially that the heliocentric model was contrary to both philosophy and Scripture, and could be discussed only as a computational convenience that had no connection to fact</span>
				<span class='text'>His system also offered a major innovation: while both the purely [[geocentric model]] and the heliocentric model as set forth by Copernicus relied on the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits, Tycho eliminated the spheres entirely</span>
				<span class='text'>Kepler tried, but was unable, to persuade Tycho to adopt the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho advocated for a system with an immobile Earth for both scientific and religious reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Tycho, the idea of a rotating and revolving Earth would be ''&quot;in violation not only of all physical truth but also of the authority of Holy Scripture, which ought to be paramount</span>

				<span class='text'>187&lt;/ref&gt;With respect to physics, Tycho held that the Earth was just too sluggish and heavy to be continuously in motion</span>
				<span class='text'> According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens (whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending) were made of [[Aether (classical element)|&quot;Aether&quot; or &quot;Quintessence&quot;]]; this substance, not found on Earth, was light, strong, unchanging, and its natural state was circular motion</span>
				<span class='text'> By contrast, the Earth (where objects seem to have motion only when moved) and things on it were composed of substances that were heavy and whose natural state was rest</span>
				<span class='text'> Accordingly, Tycho said the Earth was a &quot;lazy&quot; body that was not readily moved</span>

				<span class='text'>Moesgaard, 1972, 40</span>
				<span class='text'>Gingerich, 1973, 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus while Tycho acknowledged that the daily rising and setting of the sun and stars could be explained by the Earth's rotation, as Copernicus had said, still &lt;blockquote&gt;such a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blair, 1990, 361</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;With respect to the stars, Tycho also believed that if the Earth orbited the Sun annually there should be an observable [[stellar parallax]] over any period of six months, during which the angular orientation of a given star would change thanks to Earth's changing position</span>
				<span class='text'>(This parallax does exist, but is so small it was not detected until 1838, when [[Friedrich Bessel]] discovered a parallax of 0</span>

				<span class='text'>[[University of St Andrews]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrieved 2008-09-28&lt;/ref&gt;)  The Copernican explanation for this lack of parallax was that the stars were such a great distance from Earth that Earth's orbit was almost insignificant by comparison</span>
				<span class='text'> However, Tycho noted that this explanation introduced another problem: Stars as seen by the naked eye appear small, but of some size, with more prominent stars such as [[Vega]] appearing larger than lesser stars such as [[Polaris]], which in turn appear larger than many others</span>
				<span class='text'> Tycho had determined that a typical star measured approximately a minute of arc in size, with more prominent ones being two or three times as large</span>
				<span class='text'> In writing to [[Christoph Rothmann]], a Copernican astronomer, Tycho used basic geometry to show that, assuming a small parallax that just escaped detection, the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the sun to Saturn</span>
				<span class='text'> Moreover, the only way the stars could be so distant and still appear the sizes they do in the sky would be if even average stars were gigantic — at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the sun</span>
				<span class='text'> And, Tycho said, the more prominent stars would have to be even larger still</span>
				<span class='text'> And what if the parallax was even smaller than anyone thought, so the stars were yet more distant?  Then they would all have to be even larger still</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blair, 1990, 364</span>
				<span class='text'>Moesgaard, 1972, 51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Tycho said&lt;blockquote&gt;Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blair, 1990, 364</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Copernicans offered a religious response to Tycho's geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if He wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moesgaard, 1972, 52</span>
				<span class='text'>Vermij, 2007, 124-125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho's by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from here anything of the absurd</span>
				<span class='text'>These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant the vastness of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be asgreat as you like — these will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator</span>
				<span class='text'>It reckons that the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his majesty</span>
				<span class='text'>So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Graney, 2012, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Religion played a role in Tycho's geocentrism also – he cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest</span>
				<span class='text'> He rarely used Biblical arguments alone (to him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth's motion) and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blair, 1990,362-364&lt;/ref&gt;Tycho advocated an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system: A &quot;geo-heliocentric&quot; system now known as the [[Tychonic system]], which he developed in the late 1570s</span>
				<span class='text'>In such a system, the sun, moon, and stars circle a central Earth, while the five planets orbit the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>Moesgaard, 1972, 40-43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The essential difference between the heavens (including the planets) and the Earth remained:  Motion stayed in the aethereal heavens; immobility stayed with the heavy sluggish Earth</span>
				<span class='text'> It was a system that Tycho said violated neither the laws of physics nor sacred scripture — with stars located just beyond Saturn and of reasonable size</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Moesgaard 40, 44&lt;/ref&gt;Tycho was not the first to propose a geoheliocentric system</span>
				<span class='text'>It used to be thought that [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] in the 4th century BC had suggested that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The difference to both these systems was that Tycho's model of the Earth does not rotate daily, as Heraclides and Nilakantha claimed, but is static</span>
				<span class='text'>nother crucial difference between Tycho's 1587 geo-heliocentric model and those of other geo-heliocentric astronomers, such as [[Paul Wittich]], [[Reimarus Ursus]], [[Helisaeus Roeslin]] and [[David Origanus]], was that the orbits of Mars and the Sun intersected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; This was because Tycho had come to believe the distance of Mars from the Earth at opposition (that is, when Mars is on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun) was less than that of the Sun from the Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Tycho believed this because he came to believe Mars had a greater daily parallax than the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>But in 1584 in a letter to a fellow astronomer, Brucaeus, he had claimed that Mars had been further than the Sun at the opposition of 1582, because he had observed that Mars had little or no daily parallax</span>
				<span class='text'>He said he had therefore rejected Copernicus's model because it predicted Mars would be at only two-thirds the distance of the Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See p178-80 of Dreyer's 1890 'Tycho Brahe'&lt;/ref&gt; But he apparently later changed his mind to the opinion that Mars at opposition was indeed nearer the Earth than the Sun was, but apparently without any valid observational evidence in any discernible Martian parallax</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See p171 ''The Wittich Connection'' Gingerich and Westman 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Such intersecting Martian and solar orbits meant that there could be no solid rotating celestial spheres, because they could not possibly interpenetrate</span>
				<span class='text'>Arguably this conclusion was independently supported by the conclusion that the comet of 1577 was superlunary, because it showed less daily parallax than the Moon and thus must pass through any celestial spheres in its transit</span>
				<span class='text'>=Tychonic astronomy after Tycho==[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] 1610 telescopic discovery that Venus shows a full set of phases refuted the pure geocentric Ptolemaic model</span>
				<span class='text'>After that it seems 17th century astronomy mostly converted to geo-heliocentric planetary models that could explain these phases just as well as the heliocentric model could, but without the latter's disadvantage of the failure to detect any annual [[stellar parallax]] that Tycho and others regarded as refuting it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Taton &amp; Wilson 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The three main geo-heliocentric models were the Tychonic, the Capellan with just Mercury and Venus orbiting the Sun such as favoured by Francis Bacon, for example, and the extended Capellan model of [[Riccioli]] with Mars also orbiting the Sun whilst Saturn and Jupiter orbit the fixed Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>But the Tychonic model was probably the most popular, albeit probably in what was known as 'the semi-Tychonic' version with a daily rotating Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>This model was advocated by Tycho's ex-assistant and disciple [[Longomontanus]] in his 1622 ''Astronomia Danica'' that was the intended completion of Tycho's planetary model with his observational data, and which was regarded as the canonical statement of the complete Tychonic planetary system</span>
				<span class='text'> conversion of astronomers to geo-rotational geo-heliocentric models with a daily rotating Earth such as that of Longomontanus may have been precipitated by Francesco Sizzi's 1613 discovery of annually periodic seasonal variations of sunspot trajectories across the sun's disc</span>
				<span class='text'>They appear to oscillate above and below its apparent equator over the course of the four seasons</span>
				<span class='text'>This seasonal variation is explained much better by the hypothesis of a daily rotating Earth together with that of the sun's axis being tilted throughout its supposed annual orbit than by that of a daily orbiting sun, if not even refuting the latter hypothesis because it predicts a daily vertical oscillation of a sunspot's position, contrary to observation</span>
				<span class='text'>This discovery and its import for heliocentrism, but not for geo-heliocentrism, is discussed in the Third Day of Galileo's 1632 ''Dialogo''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See p345-56 of [[Stillman Drake]]'s 1967 ''Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems''</span>
				<span class='text'>But see Drake's ''Sunspots, Sizzi and Scheiner' in his 1970 ''Galileo Studies'' for its critical discussion of Galileo's misleading presentation of this phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to that discovery, in the late 16th century the geo-heliocentric models of Ursus and Roslin had featured a daily rotating Earth, unlike Tycho's geo-static model, as indeed had that of Heraclides in antiquity, for whatever reason</span>
				<span class='text'>he fact that Longomontanus's book was republished in two later editions in 1640 and 1663 no doubt reflected the popularity of Tychonic astronomy in the 17th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Its adherents included [[John Donne]] and the atomist and astronomer Pierre Gassendi</span>
