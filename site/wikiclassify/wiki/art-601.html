				<span class='text'>A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague [[Enrico Fermi]] about the prospects of [[Nuclear warfare|atomic warfare]], and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on [[nuclear fission]] could be used to set off an even larger [[nuclear fusion]] reaction</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of &quot;just&quot; an atomic bomb even though this was not yet anywhere near completion</span>
				<span class='text'>At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon—what he called the &quot;Super&quot;, an early concept of what was later to be known as a [[hydrogen bomb]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Oppenheimer had him investigate unusual approaches to building fission weapons, such as [[autocatalysis]], in which the efficiency of the bomb would increase as the [[nuclear chain reaction]] progressed, but proved to be impractical</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=85-87}} He also investigated using [[uranium hydride]] instead of uranium metal, but its efficiency turned out to be &quot;negligible or less&quot;</span>
