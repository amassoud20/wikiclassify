				<span class='text'>To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with ''Common Sense'' serving as a primary example</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries</span>

				<span class='text'>He synthesized various philosophical and political uses of the term in a way that permanently impacted American political thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He used two ideas from [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]: that ordinary people can indeed make sound judgments on major political issues, and that there exists a body of popular wisdom that is readily apparent to anyone</span>
				<span class='text'>Paine also used a notion of &quot;common sense&quot; favored by [[philosophe]]s in the Continental Enlightenment</span>
				<span class='text'>They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, Paine used &quot;common sense&quot; as a weapon to delegitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom</span>

				<span class='text'>Monarchy, he said, was preposterous, and it had a heathenish origin</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an institution of the devil</span>
				<span class='text'>Paine pointed to the [[Old Testament]], where almost all kings had seduced the Israelites to worship idols instead of God</span>
				<span class='text'>Paine also denounced aristocracy, which together with monarchy were &quot;two ancient tyrannies&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They violated the laws of nature, human reason, and the &quot;universal order of things&quot;, which began with God</span>

				<span class='text'>Eventually, after much pleading from Paine, New York State recognized his political services by presenting him with an estate, at [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], New York, and Paine received money from Pennsylvania and from Congress at Washington's suggestion</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Revolutionary War, Paine served as an aide to the important general, [[Nathanael Greene]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===The Silas Deane Affair====In what may have been an error, and perhaps even contributed to his resignation as the secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was openly critical of [[Silas Deane]], an American diplomat who had been appointed in March 1776 by the Congress to travel to France in secret</span>
				<span class='text'>Deane's goal was to influence the French government to finance the colonists in their fight for independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Paine largely saw Deane as a war profiteer who had little respect for principle, having been under the employ of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], one of the primary financiers of the American Revolution, and working with [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a French royal agent sent to the colonies by King Louis to investigate the Anglo-American conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>Paine labelled Deane as unpatriotic, and demanded that there be a public investigation into Morris' financing of the Revolution, as he had contracted with his own company for around $500,000</span>
				<span class='text'>nfortunately, Paine's criticisms turned against him</span>
				<span class='text'>Amongst his criticisms, he had written in the [[Pennsylvania Packet]] that France had &quot;''prefaced [their] alliance by an early and generous friendship''&quot;, referring to aid that had been provided to American colonies prior to the recognition of the Franco-American treaties</span>
				<span class='text'>It was effectively an embarrassment on France, which potentially could have jeopardised the alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Jay]], the President of the Congress who had been a fervent supporter of Deane, immediately spoke out against Paine's comments</span>
				<span class='text'>The controversy eventually became public, and Paine was then denounced as unpatriotic for criticising an American revolutionary</span>
				<span class='text'>He was even physically assaulted twice in the street by Deane supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>his much added stress took a large toll on Paine, who was generally of a sensitive character, and resigned as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs in 1779</span>

				<span class='text'>When he was later exchanged for the prisoner [[Lord Cornwallis]] (in late 1781), Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to &quot;organize&quot; the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|In 1969, a [[Prominent Americans series]] stamp honoring Paine was issued</span>
				<span class='text'>]Paine's writing greatly influenced his contemporaries and, especially, the American revolutionaries</span>
				<span class='text'>His books provoked an upsurge in Deism in America, but in the long term inspired [[Philosophical radicals|philosophic]] and working-class [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in the UK and US</span>

				<span class='text'>Paine's critique of institutionalized religion and advocacy of rational thinking influenced many British free thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as [[William Cobbett]], [[George Holyoake]], [[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In style, Paine above all others affords the variety of eloquence which, chastened and adapted to Lincoln's own mood, is revealed in Lincoln's formal writings</span>

				<span class='text'>Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought</span>

				<span class='text'>Volume I contains the major works, and volume II contains shorter writings, both published essays and a selection of letters, but confusingly organized; in addition, Foner's attributions of writings to Paine have come in for some criticism in that Foner may have included writings that Paine edited but did not write and omitted some writings that later scholars have attributed to Paine</span>
