				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Modern commentators are divided over More's religious actions as Chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>While biographers such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], a Catholic English biographer, have taken a relatively tolerant view of More's campaign against Protestantism by placing his actions within the turbulent religious climate of the time, other eminent historians, such as [[Richard Marius]], an American scholar of the Reformation, have been more critical, believing that persecutions—including More's zealous and well-documented advocacy of extermination for Protestants—were a betrayal of More's earlier humanist convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Marius&quot; /&gt;{{rp |386–406}} Some Protestants take a different view—in 1980, despite being a fierce opponent of the [[English Reformation]] that created the Church of England, More was added to the Church of England's calendar of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church, jointly with [[John Fisher]], to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More's execution) as &quot;Thomas More, Scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=CofEholyDays /&gt; When honouring him by making him [[patron saint]] of statesmen and politicians in October 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] stated: &quot;It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>even if, in his actions against heretics, he reflected the limits of the culture of his time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=JP2PatronSaint /&gt;===Resignation===As the conflict over supremacy between the Papacy and the King reached its apogee, More continued to remain steadfast in supporting the supremacy of the Pope as Successor of Peter over that of the King of England</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1530, More refused to sign a letter by the leading English churchmen and aristocrats asking [[Pope Clement VII]] to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, and also quarrelled with Henry VIII over the heresy laws</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1531, Henry had isolated More by purging most clergy who supported the papal stance from senior positions in the church</span>
				<span class='text'>Parliament's reinstatement of the charge of [[praemunire]] in 1529 had made it a crime to support in public or office the claim of any authority outside the realm (such as the Papacy) to have a legal jurisdiction superior to the King's</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King as &quot;Supreme Head&quot;]] of the Church in England</span>
				<span class='text'>As a layperson, More did not need to take the oath and the clergy, after some initial resistance, took the oath with the addition of the clause &quot;as far as the law of Christ allows</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, More saw he could not render the support Henry expected from his Lord Chancellor for the policy the King was developing to support the annulment of his marriage with Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1532 he petitioned the King to relieve him of his office, alleging failing health</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry granted his request</span>
				<span class='text'>=Trial and execution==In 1533, More refused to attend the [[coronation]] of [[Anne Boleyn]] as the [[Queen consort|Queen of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Technically, this was not an act of treason, as More had written to Henry acknowledging Anne's queenship and expressing his desire for the King's happiness and the new Queen's health</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, his refusal to attend was widely interpreted as a snub against Anne, and Henry took action against him</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly thereafter, More was charged with accepting bribes, but the charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1534, More was accused of conspiring with the &quot;Holy Maid of Kent,&quot; [[Elizabeth Barton]], a nun who had prophesied against the king's annulment, but More was able to produce a letter in which he had instructed Barton not to interfere with state matters</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed |date=January 2013}}On 13 April 1534, More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary [[First Succession Act|Act of Succession]]</span>
				<span class='text'>More accepted Parliament's right to declare [[Anne Boleyn]] the legitimate Queen of England, but he steadfastly refused to take the oath of supremacy of the Crown in the relationship between the kingdom and the church in England</span>
				<span class='text'>Holding fast to the teaching of [[papal supremacy]], More refused to take the oath and furthermore publicly refused to uphold Henry's annulment from Catherine</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===''Utopia''==={{Main|Utopia (book)}}More's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a novel written in Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>More completed and Erasmus published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (long after More's execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited</span>
				<span class='text'>More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place], 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical &quot;Utopian alphabet&quot; omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt at [[cryptography]] or precursor of [[shorthand]]</span>
				<span class='text'>topia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle)</span>
				<span class='text'>In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised)</span>
				<span class='text'>More may have used monastic communalism (rather than the biblical communalism in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]) as his model, although other concepts such as legalizing [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty</span>
				<span class='text'>Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality</span>
				<span class='text'>'Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite</span>
				<span class='text'>Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included [[New Atlantis]] by [[Francis Bacon]], [[Erewhon]] by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and [[Candide]] by [[Voltaire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern [[science fiction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Religious polemics===In 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ackroyd&quot; /&gt;{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Ackroyd&quot; /&gt;{{rp|225–6}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther’s criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance</span>

				<span class='text'>In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions</span>
				<span class='text'>More’s language, like Luther’s, was virulent: he branded Luther an &quot;ape&quot;, a &quot;drunkard&quot;, and a &quot;lousy little friar&quot; amongst other insults</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ackroyd&quot; /&gt;{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ackroyd&quot; /&gt;{{rp|279–81}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]’s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''</span>

				<span class='text'>' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale’s Answer''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale’s criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines</span>

				<span class='text'>However, as in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived</span>
				<span class='text'>These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called &quot;prison-letters&quot; (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter, [[Margaret Roper]] while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard&quot; /&gt; More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519)</span>

				<span class='text'>==Crosby Hall===The Crown confiscated More's home and estate along the Thames in Chelsea after his execution</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby Hall, which was part of More's London residence, was eventually relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect [[Walter Godfrey]] in 1910</span>
				<span class='text'>Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site</span>
				<span class='text'>Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public</span>
				<span class='text'>The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim</span>
				<span class='text'>Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be</span>
				<span class='text'>No other remnants exist of the More estate</span>
				<span class='text'>==Chelsea Old Church===[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]Across a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir</span>
				<span class='text'>Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958</span>
				<span class='text'>The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office</span>
				<span class='text'>On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the Christian nations of Europe as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it</span>
				<span class='text'>He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be</span>
				<span class='text'>It is open to the public at specific times</span>
				<span class='text'>Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L</span>
				<span class='text'>Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as &quot;saint&quot;, &quot;scholar&quot;, and &quot;statesman&quot;; the back displays his coat-of-arms</span>

				<span class='text'>More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill</span>
				<span class='text'>The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors</span>
				<span class='text'>==St Katharine Docks===Thomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed</span>
				<span class='text'>The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of &quot;Knighten Guild&quot;, derived from the original owners of the land</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives</span>
				<span class='text'>Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life</span>
