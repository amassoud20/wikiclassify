				<span class='text'>According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality</span>

				<span class='text'>k/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jul/07/masacciothegreatestrenaissa The Guardian, ''Masaccio, the old master who died young'']&lt;/ref&gt;The name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning &quot;clumsy&quot; or &quot;messy&quot; Tom</span>
				<span class='text'>The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as [[Masolino]] (&quot;little/delicate Tom&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>espite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the first to use linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in his painting, employing techniques such as [[vanishing point]] in art for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>He also moved away from the [[International Gothic]] style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like [[Gentile da Fabriano]] to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and [[chiaroscuro]] for greater [[realism (arts)|realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Masaccio was born to Giovanni di Simone Cassai and Jacopa di Martinozzo in Castel San Giovanni di Altura, now [[San Giovanni Valdarno]] (today part of the [[province of Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John T</span>
				<span class='text'>Spike, ''Masaccio,'' New York: 1996, 21-64, and Diane Cole Ahl, ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' Cambridge, 2002, 3-5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[notary]] and his mother the daughter of an innkeeper of [[Barberino di Mugello]], a town a few miles north of [[Florence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His family name, Cassai, comes from the trade of his paternal grandfather Simone and granduncle Lorenzo, who were carpenters/cabinet makers (''casse'', hence ''cassai'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Masaccio's father died in 1406, when he was only five; later that same year a brother was born, named Giovanni (1406–1486) after his father</span>
				<span class='text'>He also was to become a painter, with the nickname of [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi|lo Scheggia]] meaning &quot;the splinter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;On Giovanni's career, see Luciano Bellosi and Margaret Haines, ''Lo Scheggia,'' Florence, 1999</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1412 Monna Jacopa married an elderly [[apothecary]], Tedesco di maestro Feo, who already had several daughters, one of whom grew up to marry the only other documented painter from Castel San Giovanni, Mariotto di Cristofano (1393–1457)</span>
				<span class='text'>here is no evidence for Masaccio's artistic education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Vasari (II, 295) implies that Masolino was Masaccio's teacher, but the earliest known work by Masaccio (the ''San Giovenale Triptych'') is painted in a style so different from Masolino's approach that it is hard to tie the two together (Luciano Berti, &quot;Masaccio 1422,&quot; ''Commentari'' 12 (1961) 84-107</span>
				<span class='text'> Scholars cannot agree on any teacher for the young artist, though several names (Mariotto di Cristofano, Bicci di Lorenzo, Niccolo di ser Lapo) have been put forward</span>
				<span class='text'>Recently scholars have also suggested that he may have trained as a manuscript illuminator</span>

				<span class='text'>Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 105-122</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  (Renaissance painters traditionally began an apprenticeship with an established master at about the age of 12</span>
				<span class='text'> Masaccio would likely have had to move to Florence to receive his training, but he was not documented in the city until he joined the painters guild (the Arte de' Medici e Speziali) as an independent master on January 7, 1422, signing as &quot;Masus S</span>
				<span class='text'>Johannis Simonis pictor populi S</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicholae de Florentia</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;==First works==The first works attributed to Masaccio are the [[San Giovenale Triptych]] (1422), now in the Museum of Cascia di Reggello, near Florence, and the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (Masaccio)|''Virgin and Child with Saint Anne'']] (Sant'Anna Metterza) (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1424) at the [[Uffizi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Image:San Giovenale Masaccio</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|360px|''[[San Giovenale Triptych]]'' (1422)]] The San Giovenale altarpiece was only discovered in 1961 in the church of San Giovenale at Cascia di Reggello, which is very close to Masaccio's hometown</span>
				<span class='text'> It represents the Virgin and Child with angels in the central panel, Sts</span>
				<span class='text'>Bartholomew and Blaise on the left panel, and Sts</span>
				<span class='text'>Juvenal (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>San Giovenale) and Anthony Abbot in the right panel</span>
				<span class='text'> The painting has lost much of its original framing, and its surface is badly abraded</span>

				<span class='text'>Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 124-126</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Masaccio's concern to suggest three-dimensionality through volumetric figures and foreshortened forms (a revival of Giotto's approach, rather than a continuation of contemporary trends) is already apparent</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Image:Masolino 008</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Masolino &amp; Masaccio, ''[[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (Masaccio)|Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1424), Uffizi]] The second work was perhaps Masaccio's first collaboration with the older and already-renowned artist, [[Masolino|Masolino da Panicale]] (1383/4-c</span>
				<span class='text'>1436)</span>
				<span class='text'>The circumstances of the 2 artists' collaboration are unclear; since Masolino was considerably older, it seems likely that he brought Masaccio under his wing, but the division of hands in the ''Virgin and Child with Saint Anne'' is so marked - Masolino is believed to have painted the figure of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Anne and the angels that hold the cloth of honor behind her, while Masaccio painted the more important Virgin and Child on their throne - that it is hard to see the older artist as the controlling figure in this commission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Roberto Longhi, &quot;Fatti di Masolino e di Masaccio,&quot; ''Critica d'arte'' 25-6 (1940) 145-191</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Masolino's figures are delicate, graceful and somewhat flat, while Masaccio's are solid and hefty</span>
				<span class='text'>=Maturity==In Florence, Masaccio could study the works of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] and become friends with [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Donatello]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], at their prompting in 1423 Masaccio travelled to Rome with Masolino: from that point he was freed of all [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence, as may be seen in his [[altarpiece]] for the Carmelite Church in [[Pisa]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The traces of influences from ancient Roman and Greek art that are present in some of Masaccio's works presumably originated from this trip: they should also have been present in a lost ''Sagra'', (today known through some drawings, including one by [[Michelangelo]]), a fresco commissioned for the consecration ceremony of the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in Florence (April 19, 1422)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was destroyed when the church's cloister was rebuilt at the end of the 16th century</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|400px|''The Tribute Money'', fresco in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence]]==Brancacci Chapel==In 1424 the &quot;duo preciso e noto&quot; (&quot;well and known duo&quot;) of Masaccio and Masolino was commissioned by the powerful and rich Felice Brancacci to execute a cycle of frescoes for the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>Painting began around 1425 with the two artists probably working simultaneously</span>
				<span class='text'>For reasons that are unclear they left the chapel unfinished, and it was completed by Filippino Lippi in the 1480s</span>
				<span class='text'>The iconography of the fresco decoration is somewhat unusual; while the majority of the frescoes represent the life of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter, 2 scenes, on either side of the threshold of the chapel space, depict the temptation and expulsion of Adam and Eve</span>
				<span class='text'> As a whole the frescoes represent human sin and its redemption through the actions of Peter, the first pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza, ''The Brancacci Chapel,'' New York, 1990; Diane Cole Ahl, &quot;The Brancacci Chapel,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 138-157</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The style of Masaccio's scenes shows the influence of Giotto especially</span>
				<span class='text'>Figures are large, heavy, and solid; emotions are expressed through faces and gestures; and there is a strong impression of naturalism throughout the paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Giotto, however, Masaccio uses linear and atmospheric perspective, directional light, and ''chiaroscuro,'' which is the representation of form through light and color without outlines</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his frescoes are even more convincingly lifelike than those of his trecento predecessor</span>
				<span class='text'>== Works of the chapel ===[[Image:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|When it was cleaned in the 1980s, Masaccio's [[fresco]] of ''[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Masaccio)|The Expulsion]]'' (1426–1427) lost the added fig leaves</span>
				<span class='text'>][[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Masaccio)|''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'']], depicts a distressed [[Adam and Eve]], chased from the garden by a threatening angel</span>
				<span class='text'> Adam covers his entire face to express his shame, while Eve's shame requires her to cover certain areas of her body</span>
				<span class='text'>The fresco had a huge influence on [[Michelangelo]] and his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Another major work is ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'' in which [[Jesus]] and the Apostles are depicted as neo-classical archetypes</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window, as if the figures are lit by it; this is an added stroke of verisimilitude and further tribute to Masaccio's innovative genius</span>
				<span class='text'>n the ''Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'' he painted a pavement in perspective, framed by large buildings to obtain a three-dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportionate to their surroundings</span>
				<span class='text'>In this he was a pioneer in applying the newly discovered rules of perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1425 Masolino left the work and went to [[Hungary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not known if this was because of money quarrels with Felice or even if there was an artistic divergence with Masaccio</span>
				<span class='text'>It has also been supposed that Masolino planned this trip from the very beginning, and needed a close collaborator who could continue the work after his departure</span>
				<span class='text'> But Masaccio left the frescoes [[unfinished work|unfinished]] in 1426 in order to respond to other commissions, probably coming from the same patron</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it has also been suggested that the declining finances of Felice Brancacci were insufficient to pay for any more work, so the painter therefore sought work elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Filippino Lippi 011</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus]]Masaccio returned in 1427 to work again in the Carmine, beginning the ''Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'', but apparently left it, too, unfinished, though it has also been suggested that the painting was severely damaged later in the century because it contained portraits of the Brancacci family, at that time excoriated as enemies of the [[Medici]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The work was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century, and only eleven of about twenty original panels have been rediscovered in various collections around the world</span>

				<span class='text'>Carl Brandon Strehlke, Milan, 2002, 89-109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The central panel of the altarpiece (''[[The Madonna and Child (Masaccio)|The Madonna and Child]]'') is now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it is very damaged, the work features a sculptural and human Madonna as well as a convincing perspectival depiction of her throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Masaccio probably worked on it entirely in Pisa, shuttling back and forth to Florence, where he was still working on the Brancacci Chapel</span>
				<span class='text'>In these years [[Donatello]] was also working in Pisa at a monument for Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci, to be sent to [[Naples]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been suggested that Masaccio's first ventures in plasticity and perspective were based on Donatello's sculpture, before he could study [[Brunelleschi]]'s more scientific approach to perspective</span>

				<span class='text'>1427) - Fresco, [[Santa Maria Novella, Florence]]]]Around 1427 Masaccio won a prestigious commission to produce a ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' for the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>No contemporary documents record the patron of the fresco, but recently references to ownership of a tomb at the foot of the fresco have been found in the records of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella Quarter of Florence; this working-class family expressed a long-standing devotion to the Trinity, and may well have commissioned Masaccio's painting</span>

				<span class='text'> Most scholars had thought that the Lenzi family commissioned the fresco:  Ugo Procacci, &quot;Nuove testimonianze su Masaccio,&quot; ''Commentari'', 27 (1976) 233-4; Rona Goffen, ''Masaccio's &quot;Trinity,&quot;'' Cambridge, 1998; Timothy Verdon, &quot;Masaccio's ''Trinity,''&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 158-160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Probably it is the male patron who is represented to the left of the Virgin in the painting, while his wife is right of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John the Evangelist</span>
				<span class='text'>The fresco, considered by many to be Masaccio's masterwork, is the earliest surviving painting to use systematic linear perspective, possibly devised by Masaccio with the assistance of Brunelleschi himself</span>

				<span class='text'>244-246&lt;/ref&gt; Masaccio started by producing a rough drawing of the composition and perspective lines on the wall</span>
				<span class='text'>The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco</span>
				<span class='text'>To ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the [[vanishing point]] under the base of the cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster</span>

				<span class='text'> This skeleton is at once a reference to Adam, whose sin brought humans to death and a reminder to viewers that their time on earth is transitory</span>

				<span class='text'>Catherine in the [[Basilica di San Clemente]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It has never been confirmed that Masaccio collaborated on that work, even though it is possible that he contributed to Masolino's polyptych for the altar of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] with his panel portraying ''[[St</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Vasari, all &quot;most celebrated&quot; Florentine &quot;sculptors and painters&quot; studied his frescoes extensively in order to &quot;learn the precepts and rules for painting well&quot;</span>
