				<span class='text'>A [[humanism|humanist]], he was a part of the transition between [[transcendentalism]] and [[literary realism|realism]], incorporating both views in his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of [[free verse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds314/&gt; His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>orn in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]] on [[Long Island]], Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the [[American Civil War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Early in his career, he also produced a [[temperance novel]], ''[[Franklin Evans]]'' (1842)</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitman's major work, ''Leaves of Grass'', was first published in 1855 with his own money</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American [[epic poetry|epic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892</span>
				<span class='text'>After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where his health further declined</span>
				<span class='text'>When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving480/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reynolds589&gt;Reynolds, 589&lt;/ref&gt;Whitman's sexuality is often discussed alongside his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Though biographers continue to debate his sexuality, he is usually described as either [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] in his feelings and attractions</span>
				<span class='text'>However, there is disagreement among biographers as to whether Whitman had actual sexual experiences with men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving19&gt;Loving, 19&lt;/ref&gt;Whitman was concerned with politics throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]] and opposed the extension of slavery generally</span>
				<span class='text'>His poetry presented an egalitarian view of the races, though his attitude in life reflected many of the racial prejudices common to nineteenth-century America and his opposition to slavery was not necessarily based on belief in the equality of races ''per se''</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |title=The Walt Whitman Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Life and work=====Early life===Walter Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in [[West Hills, New York|West Hills]], [[Huntington, New York|Town of Huntington]], [[Long Island]], to parents with interests in [[Quaker]] thought, Walter and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman</span>
				<span class='text'>The second of nine children,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 17&lt;/ref&gt; he was immediately nicknamed &quot;Walt&quot; to distinguish him from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving29&gt;Loving, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Whitman, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>named three of his seven sons after American leaders: [[Andrew Jackson]], [[George Washington]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed at the age of six months</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple's sixth son, the youngest, was named Edward</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving29/&gt; At age four, Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to [[Brooklyn]], living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 24&lt;/ref&gt; One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;At age eleven Whitman concluded formal schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 32&lt;/ref&gt; He then sought employment for further income for his family; he was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] and [[printer's devil]] for the weekly Long Island newspaper the ''Patriot'', edited by Samuel E</span>
				<span class='text'>Clements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 44&lt;/ref&gt; There, Whitman learned about the printing press and [[typesetting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have written &quot;sentimental bits&quot; of filler material for occasional issues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of [[Elias Hicks]] to create a plaster mold of his head</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Clements left the ''Patriot'' shortly afterward, possibly as a result of the controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 34&lt;/ref&gt;===Early career===[[File:Walt Whitman, age 28, 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|upright|Whitman, age 28]]The following summer Whitman worked for another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds45&gt;Reynolds, 45&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved back to West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] weekly newspaper the ''Long-Island Star''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds45/&gt; While at the ''Star'', Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 32&lt;/ref&gt; and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the ''[[New York Mirror]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 79&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the ''Star'' and Brooklyn</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 77&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] to work as a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 35&lt;/ref&gt; though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kaplan81&gt;Kaplan, 81&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district,&lt;ref name=Kaplan81/&gt; and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the [[Panic of 1837]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 36&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 37&lt;/ref&gt;After his teaching attempts, Whitman went back to Huntington, New York to found his own newspaper, the ''[[Long Islander News|Long Islander]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitman served as publisher, editor, pressman, and distributor and even provided home delivery</span>
				<span class='text'>After ten months, he sold the publication to E</span>
				<span class='text'>O</span>
				<span class='text'>Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds60&gt;Reynolds, 60&lt;/ref&gt; There are no known surviving copies of the ''Long-Islander'' published under Whitman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 38&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in [[Jamaica, Queens]] with the ''Long Island Democrat'', edited by James J</span>
				<span class='text'>Brenton</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds60/&gt; He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; One story, possibly apocryphal, tells of Whitman's being chased away from a teaching job in [[Southold, New York]] in 1840</span>
				<span class='text'>After a local preacher called him a &quot;[[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodomite]]&quot;, Whitman was allegedly [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographer Justin Kaplan notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Jerome Loving calls the incident a &quot;myth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 514&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called &quot;Sun-Down Papers—From the Desk of a Schoolmaster&quot;, in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841</span>
				<span class='text'>In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stacy, 25&lt;/ref&gt;Whitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the ''New World'', working under [[Park Benjamin, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>] and [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 56&lt;/ref&gt; He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the ''Aurora'' and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stacy, 6&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Brooklyn Daily Eagle2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Brooklyn Daily Eagle, c</span>
				<span class='text'>1915]]He also contributed freelance fiction and poetry throughout the 1840s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman lost his position at the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' in 1848 after siding with the free-soil &quot;[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburner]]&quot; wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper's owner, Isaac Van Anden, who belonged to the conservative, or &quot;[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Hunker]]&quot;, wing of the party</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stacy, 87–91&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the [[Free Soil Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Leaves of Grass''==={{main|Leaves of Grass}}Whitman claimed that after years of competing for &quot;the usual rewards&quot;, he determined to become a poet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 185&lt;/ref&gt; He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 85&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1850, he began writing what would become ''Leaves of Grass'',&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 154&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman intended to write a distinctly American [[epic poetry|epic]]&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 155&lt;/ref&gt; and used [[free verse]] with a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] based on the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 187&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of June 1855, Whitman surprised his brothers with the already-printed first edition of ''Leaves of Grass''</span>
				<span class='text'>George &quot;didn't think it worth reading&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>rg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines</span>
				<span class='text'> The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines—1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called &quot;Song of Myself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The book received its strongest praise from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 203&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 340&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to Emerson's approval,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 232&lt;/ref&gt; but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly &quot;obscene&quot; nature of the poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 414&lt;/ref&gt; Geologist [[John Peter Lesley]] wrote to Emerson, calling the book &quot;trashy, profane &amp; obscene&quot; and the author &quot;a pretentious ass&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 211&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 1855, a few days after ''Leaves of Grass'' was published,  Whitman's father died at the age of 65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 229&lt;/ref&gt;In the months following the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 348&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 238&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1856</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 207&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leaves of Grass'' was revised and re-released in 1860&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 238&lt;/ref&gt; again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life</span>
				<span class='text'>Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including [[Bronson Alcott]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 363&lt;/ref&gt;During the first publications of ''Leaves of Grass'', Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's ''Daily Times'' starting in May 1857</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 225&lt;/ref&gt; As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 368&lt;/ref&gt; He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear if he was fired or chose to leave</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 228&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s</span>

				<span class='text'>]As the [[American Civil War]] was beginning, Whitman published his poem &quot;[[s:Leaves of Grass/Book XXI#Beat! Beat! Drums!|Beat! Beat! Drums!]]&quot; as a patriotic rally call for the North</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 283&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's brother George had joined the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 410&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' included &quot;First Lieutenant G</span>
				<span class='text'>W</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitmore&quot;, which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kaplan268&gt;Kaplan, 268&lt;/ref&gt; He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds411&gt;Reynolds, 411&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people&quot;, Whitman later wrote,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 286&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound on his cheek</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Kaplan268/&gt; Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington on December 28, 1862 with the intention of never returning to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds411/&gt;In Washington, D</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Whitman's friend Charley Eldridge helped him obtain part-time work in the army paymaster's office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 293&lt;/ref&gt; He would write of this experience in &quot;The Great Army of the Sick&quot;, published in a New York newspaper in 1863&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 273&lt;/ref&gt; and, 12&amp;nbsp;years later, in a book called ''Memoranda During the War''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 297&lt;/ref&gt; He then contacted Emerson, this time to ask for help in obtaining a government post</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds411/&gt; Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to [[Salmon P</span>
				<span class='text'>Chase]], Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department</span>
				<span class='text'>Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as ''Leaves of Grass''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 295&lt;/ref&gt;The Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864</span>
				<span class='text'>On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 281&lt;/ref&gt; and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of [[tuberculosis]] compounded by [[alcoholism]] on December 3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 454&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in the [[Department of the Interior]], thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor</span>
				<span class='text'>O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', had written to [[William Tod Otto]], Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], on Whitman's behalf</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving283&gt;Loving, 283&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds455&gt;Reynolds, 455&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a [[furlough]] because of his poor health</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving283/&gt; By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship&lt;ref name=Reynolds455/&gt; and published ''Drum-Taps''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving290&gt;Loving, 290&lt;/ref&gt;Effective June 30, 1865, however, Whitman was fired from his job</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Loving290/&gt; His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior, former [[Iowa]] Senator [[James Harlan (senator)|James Harlan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds455/&gt; Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who &quot;were seldom at their respective desks&quot;, he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of ''Leaves of Grass''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 291&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor protested until J</span>
				<span class='text'>Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General's office on July 1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 304&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor, though, was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study, ''The Good Gray Poet'', in January 1866</span>
				<span class='text'>The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet's nickname and increased his popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 456-457&lt;/ref&gt; Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of &quot;[[O Captain! My Captain!]]&quot;, a relatively conventional poem on the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman's lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 309&lt;/ref&gt;Part of Whitman's role at the Attorney General's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential [[pardon]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There are real characters among them&quot;, he later wrote, &quot;and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 293&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 318–319&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped it would be its last edition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Loving, 314&quot;&gt;Loving, 314&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1868, ''Poems of Walt Whitman'' was published in England thanks to the influence of [[William Michael Rossetti]],&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 326&lt;/ref&gt; with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 324&lt;/ref&gt; The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer [[Anne Gilchrist (writer)|Anne Gilchrist]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 75&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including ''The Madman'' and a short story &quot;Reuben's Last Wish&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds117&gt;Reynolds, 117&lt;/ref&gt; At first he was opposed to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], believing the movement did more harm than good</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their &quot;[[wikt:ultraism|ultraism]] and officiousness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Reynolds117/&gt; In 1856, in his unpublished ''The Eighteenth Presidency'', addressing the men of the South, he wrote &quot;you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote&lt;ref name=Reynolds473&gt;Reynolds, 473&lt;/ref&gt; and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature</span>

				<span class='text'>]Walt Whitman has been claimed as America's first &quot;poet of democracy&quot;, a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character</span>
				<span class='text'>A British friend of Walt Whitman, Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: &quot;You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without ''Leaves of Grass''</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Callow, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that &quot;people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 475&lt;/ref&gt;The literary critic, [[Harold Bloom]] wrote, as the introduction for the 150th anniversary of ''Leaves of Grass'':{{quote|If you are American, then Walt Whitman is your imaginative father and mother, even if, like myself, you have never composed a line of verse</span>
				<span class='text'>You can nominate a fair number of literary works as candidates for the secular Scripture of the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>They might include [[Herman Melville|Melville's]] ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Mark Twain|Twain's]] ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', and Emerson's two series of ''Essays'' and ''[[The Conduct of Life]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>None of those, not even Emerson's, are as central as the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Loving, 181&lt;/ref&gt;[[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] numbered himself among Whitman's &quot;wild children&quot;, and the title of his 1961 collection ''[[Starting from San Francisco]]'' is a deliberate reference to Whitman's ''Starting from Paumanok''</span>

				<span class='text'>Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death</span>
