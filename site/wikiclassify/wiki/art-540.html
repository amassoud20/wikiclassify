				<span class='text'>His father was the liberal lawyer, statesman, and journalist [[Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov]] (1870–1922) and his mother was the heiress Yelena Ivanovna ''née'' Rukavishnikova, the granddaughter of a millionaire [[gold-mine]] owner</span>
				<span class='text'> His cousins included the composer [[Nicolas Nabokov]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The youngest daughter Elena, who would in later years become Vladimir's favourite sibling, published her correspondence with her brother in 1985 and would become an important living source for later biographers of Nabokov</span>
				<span class='text'>abokov spent his childhood and youth in [[Saint Petersburg]] and at the country estate ''Vyra'' near [[Siverskaya]], to the south of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>His childhood, which he had called &quot;perfect&quot;, was remarkable in several ways</span>
				<span class='text'>The family spoke Russian, English, and French in their household, and Nabokov was trilingual from an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>He relates that the first English book his mother read to him was ''Misunderstood'' (1869) by [[Florence Montgomery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, much to his patriotic father's chagrin, Nabokov could read and write in English before he could in Russian</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Speak, Memory]]'' Nabokov recalls numerous details of his privileged childhood, and his ability to recall in vivid detail memories of his past was a boon to him during his permanent exile, and it provided a theme that echoes from his first book ''[[Mary (novel)|Mary]]'' to later works such as ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While the family was nominally [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], they felt no religious fervor, and Vladimir was not forced to attend church after he lost interest</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916, Nabokov inherited the estate [[Rozhdestveno Memorial Estate|Rozhdestveno]], next to Vyra, from his uncle Vasily Ivanovich Rukavishnikov (&quot;Uncle Ruka&quot; in ''Speak, Memory''), but lost it in the [[October Revolution]] one year later; this was the only house he ever owned</span>

				<span class='text'>Nabokov possessed it for less than a year before losing it in the October Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>]Nabokov's adolescence was also the period in which his first serious literary endeavors were made</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1916, Nabokov had his first collection of poetry published, ''Stikhi'' (&quot;Poems&quot;), a collection of 68 Russian poems</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, Nabokov was attending Tenishev school in Saint Petersburg, where his literature teacher Vladimir Vasilievich Gippius had been critical toward his literary accomplishments</span>
				<span class='text'>Some time after the publication of ''Stikhi'', [[Zinaida Gippius]], renowned poet and first cousin of Vladimir Gippius, told Nabokov's father at a social event, &quot;Please tell your son that he will never be a writer</span>

				<span class='text'>They lived at a friend's estate and in September 1918 moved to [[Livadiya, Ukraine|Livadiya]], at the time part of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian Republic]]; Nabokov's father became a minister of justice in the [[Crimean Regional Government]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the withdrawal of the German Army (November 1918) and the defeat of the [[White Army]] (early 1919), the Nabokovs sought exile in western Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>They settled briefly in England and Vladimir enrolled in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], first studying [[zoology]], then [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Romance languages]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His examination results on the first part of the [[Tripos]], taken at the end of second year, were a [[starred first]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He sat the second part of the exam in his third year, just after his father's death</span>
				<span class='text'> Nabokov feared that he might fail the exam, but his script was marked [[Second class honours|second-class]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His final examination result was second-class, and his BA conferred in 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>Nabokov later drew on his Cambridge experiences to write several works, including the novels ''[[Glory (novel)|Glory]]'' and ''[[The Real Life of Sebastian Knight]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1920, Nabokov's family moved to Berlin, where his father set up the émigré newspaper ''Rul''' (&quot;Rudder&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Nabokov followed them to Berlin two years later, after completing his studies at Cambridge</span>
				<span class='text'>==Berlin years (1922–37)===In March 1922, Nabokov's father was fatally shot in Berlin by the Russian monarchist [[Piotr Shabelsky-Bork]] as he was trying to shield the real target, [[Pavel Milyukov]], a leader of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]]-in-exile</span>
				<span class='text'>This mistaken, violent death would echo again and again in Nabokov's fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms</span>
				<span class='text'>(In ''[[Pale Fire]]'', for example, one interpretation of the novel has an assassin mistakenly kill the poet John Shade, when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch</span>
				<span class='text'> Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to [[Prague]]</span>
				<span class='text'>abokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer within the émigré community and published under the nom de plume ''V</span>
				<span class='text'>Sirin'' (a reference to the [[sirin|fabulous bird]] of Russian folklore)</span>
				<span class='text'>To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons</span>

				<span class='text'> He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Nabokov in 1973]]Nabokov's first writings were in Russian, but he achieved his greatest fame with the novels he wrote in the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>As a bilingual master, he has been compared to [[Joseph Conrad]]; Nabokov, however, disliked both the comparison and Conrad's work</span>
				<span class='text'>He lamented to the critic Edmund Wilson, &quot;I am too old to change Conradically&quot; – which John Updike later called, &quot;itself a jest of genius&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This lament came in 1941, when Nabokov had been an apprentice American for less than one year</span>

				<span class='text'>221</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in the Wilson letters, Nabokov offers a solid, non-comic appraisal: &quot;Conrad knew how to handle readymade English better than I; but I know better the other kind</span>
				<span class='text'>He never sinks to the depths of my solecisms, but neither does he scale my verbal peaks</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This is in November 1950, p</span>
				<span class='text'>282</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nabokov translated many of his own early works into English, sometimes in cooperation with his son Dmitri</span>
				<span class='text'>His trilingual upbringing had a profound influence on his artistry</span>
				<span class='text'>abokov himself translated into Russian two books that he had originally written in English, ''Conclusive Evidence'' and ''Lolita''</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;translation&quot; of ''Conclusive Evidence'' was made because of Nabokov's feeling of imperfection in the English version</span>
				<span class='text'>Writing the book, he noted that he needed to translate his own memories into English, and to spend a lot of time explaining things that are well known in Russia; then he decided to re-write the book once again, in his first native language, and after that he made the final version, ''Speak, Memory'' (Nabokov first wanted to name it &quot;Speak, [[Mnemosyne]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Nabokov was a proponent of [[individualism]], and rejected concepts and ideologies that curtailed individual freedom and expression, such as [[totalitarianism]] in its various forms, as well as [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Garland Companion to VN'', ibid, pages 412ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poshlost]], or as he transcribed it, ''poshlust'', is disdained and frequently mocked in his works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Garland Companion to VN, ibid, pages 628ff&lt;/ref&gt; On translating ''Lolita'', Nabokov writes, &quot;I imagined that in some distant future somebody might produce a Russian version of Lolita</span>
				<span class='text'>I trained my inner telescope upon that particular point in the distant future and I saw that every paragraph, pock-marked as it is with pitfalls, could lend itself to hideous mistranslation</span>
				<span class='text'>In the hands of a harmful drudge, the Russian version of Lolita would be entirely degraded and botched by vulgar paraphrases or blunders</span>
				<span class='text'>So I decided to translate it myself</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;Nabokov is noted for his complex plots, clever word play, daring metaphors, and prose style capable of both parody and intense lyricism</span>
				<span class='text'>He gained both fame and notoriety with his novel ''Lolita'' (1955), which tells of a grown man's devouring passion for a twelve-year-old girl</span>
				<span class='text'>This and his other novels, particularly ''Pale Fire'' (1962), won him a place among the greatest novelists of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His longest novel, which met with a mixed response, is ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada]]'' (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>He devoted more time to the composition of this novel than any of his others</span>
				<span class='text'>Nabokov's fiction is characterized by linguistic playfulness</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, his short story &quot;[[The Vane Sisters]]&quot; is famous in part for its [[acrostic]] final paragraph, in which the first letters of each word spell out a message from beyond the grave</span>
				<span class='text'>abokov's stature as a literary critic is founded largely on his four-volume translation and commentary for [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s novel in verse, ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', published in 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>That commentary ended with an appendix titled ''[[Notes on Prosody]]'', which has developed a reputation of its own</span>
				<span class='text'>It stemmed from his observation that while Pushkin's [[iambic tetrameter]]s had been a part of [[Russian literature]] for a fairly short two centuries, they were clearly understood by the Russian prosodists</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, he viewed the much older English iambic tetrameters as muddled and poorly documented</span>
				<span class='text'>In his own words:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been forced to invent a simple little terminology of my own, explain its application to English verse forms, and indulge in certain rather copious details of classification before even tackling the limited object of these notes to my translation of Pushkin's ''Eugene Onegin'', an object that boils down to very little—in comparison to the forced preliminaries—namely, to a few things that the non-Russian student of Russian literature must know in regard to Russian prosody in general and to ''Eugene Onegin'' in particular</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Nabokov's lectures at Cornell University, as collected in ''Lectures on Literature'', reveal his controversial ideas concerning art</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Strehle, Susan</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Actualism: Pynchon's Debt to Nabokov&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>University of Wisconsin Press, 1971, p</span>
				<span class='text'>37-38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He firmly believed that novels should not aim to teach and that readers should not merely empathise with characters but that a 'higher' aesthetic enjoyment should be attained, partly by paying great attention to details of style and structure</span>
				<span class='text'>He detested what he saw as 'general ideas' in novels, and so when teaching ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', for example, he would insist students keep an eye on where the characters were in Dublin (with the aid of a map) rather than teaching the complex Irish history that many critics see as being essential to an understanding of the novel</span>
				<span class='text'>During his ten years at Cornell, Nabokov introduced undergraduates to the delights of great fiction, including ''[[Bleak House]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], in fifty-minute classroom lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;collected by Fredson Bowers in 1980 and published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich&lt;/ref&gt;In 2010, ''[[Kitsch (magazine)|Kitsch]]'' magazine, a student publication at Cornell, published a piece that focused on student reflections on these lectures and also explored Nabokov's long relationship with ''[[Playboy]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Gould notes that Nabokov was occasionally a scientific &quot;stick-in-the-mud&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Nabokov never accepted that [[genetics]] or the counting of [[chromosome]]s could be a valid way to distinguish species of insects, and relied on the traditional (for lepidopterists) microscopic comparison of their [[genitalia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>At the time of Nabokov's birth, the offset between the calendars was 12 days</span>
				<span class='text'>His date of birth in the Julian calendar was 10 April 1899;&lt;ref name=&quot;B1993p37&quot;&gt;[[#Boyd1993|Brian Boyd]] p 37&lt;/ref&gt; in the Gregorian, 22 April 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;B1993p37&quot;/&gt; The fact that the offset increased from 12 to 13 days for dates occurring after February 1900 was always irrelevant to earlier dates, and hence a 13-day offset should never have been applied to Nabokov's date of birth</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, it was so misapplied by some writers, and 23 April came to be erroneously shown in many places as his birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs ''[[Speak, Memory]]'' Nabokov indicates that 22 April was the correct date but that he nevertheless preferred to celebrate his birthday &quot;with diminishing pomp&quot; on 23 April (p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;6)</span>
				<span class='text'>As he happily pointed out on several occasions during interviews, this meant he also shared a birthday with [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Shirley Temple]] (see, for example, his ''New York Times'' interview with Alden Whitman on 23 April 1969, p</span>
