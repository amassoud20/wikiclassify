				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;== Life ==Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in [[Paris]] and lived there for most of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>His initial schooling was undertaken during [[World War II]], during which time he attended the [[Lycée Carnot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also spent a year in [[khâgne]] at the [[Lycée Henri IV]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the [[Nazi occupation of France]], Deleuze's older brother, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the [[French Resistance]], and died while in transit to a concentration camp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Jean Hyppolite]], [[Ferdinand Alquié]], and [[Maurice de Gandillac]], and Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Deleuze found the work of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] attractive</span>

				<span class='text'>He married Denise Paul &quot;Fanny&quot; Grandjouan in 1956</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1960 to 1964 he held a position at the [[French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|Centre National de Recherche Scientifique]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time he published the seminal ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'' (1962) and befriended [[Michel Foucault]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1964 to 1969 he was a professor at the [[University of Lyon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968 he published his two dissertations, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (supervised by Gandillac) and ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (supervised by Alquié)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Philosophy ==Deleuze's works fall into two groups: on one hand, monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers ([[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], Foucault) and artists ([[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]); on the other, eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> difference, sense, events, schizophrenia, cinema, philosophy)</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless of topic, however, Deleuze consistently develops variations on similar ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>== Metaphysics&lt;!--'Transcendental empiricism' redirects here--&gt; ===Deleuze's main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be baldly summarized as an inversion of the traditional [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relationship between [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> to say that &quot;X is different from Y&quot; assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms)</span>
				<span class='text'>To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference</span>
				<span class='text'>Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, &quot;given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bergson's Conception of Difference&quot;, in ''Desert Islands'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences</span>
				<span class='text'>Apparent identities such as &quot;X&quot; are composed of endless series of differences, where &quot;X&quot; = &quot;the difference between x and x'&quot;, and &quot;x'&quot; = &quot;the difference between</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;, and so forth</span>
				<span class='text'>Difference, in other words, goes all the way down</span>
				<span class='text'>To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> fail to attain what he calls &quot;difference in itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &quot;If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its ''internal difference''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Like Kant and Bergson, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls &quot;the virtual&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: &quot;real without being actual, ideal without being abstract</span>

				<span class='text'>III: see the fourth line from the bottom of [http://gallica</span>

				<span class='text'>u/p/proust/marcel/p96t/chapter3</span>
				<span class='text'>tml here]: &quot;I began to discover the cause by comparing those varying happy impressions which had the common quality of being felt simultaneously at the actual moment and at a distance in time, because of which common quality the noise of the spoon upon the plate, the unevenness of the paving-stones, the taste of the madeleine, imposed the past upon the present and made me hesitate as to which time I was existing in</span>
				<span class='text'>Of a truth, the being within me which sensed this impression, sensed what it had in common in former days and now, sensed its extra-temporal character, a being which only appeared when through the medium of the identity of present and past, it found itself in the only setting in which it could exist and enjoy the essence of things, that is, outside Time</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Nothing but a moment of the past? Much more perhaps; something which being common to the past and the present, is more essential than both</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> a marvellous expedient of nature had caused a sensation to flash to me—sound of a spoon and of a hammer, uneven paving-stones—simultaneously in the past which permitted my imagination to grasp it and in the present in which the shock to my senses caused by the noise had effected a contact between the dreams of the imagination and that of which they are habitually deprived, namely, the idea of existence—and thanks to that stratagem had permitted that being within me to secure, to isolate and to render static for the duration of a lightning flash that which it can never wholly grasp, a fraction of Time in its pure essence</span>
				<span class='text'>When, with such a shudder of happiness, I heard the sound common, at once, to the spoon touching the plate, to the hammer striking the wheel, to the unevenness of the paving-stones in the courtyard of the Guermantes’ mansion and the Baptistry of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mark’s, it was because that being within me can only be nourished on the essence of things and finds in them alone its subsistence and its delight</span>
				<span class='text'>It languishes in the observation by the senses of the present sterilised by the intelligence awaiting a future constructed by the will out of fragments of the past and the present from which it removes still more reality, keeping that only which serves the narrow human aim of utilitarian purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>But let a sound, a scent already heard and breathed in the past be heard and breathed anew, simultaneously in the present and in the past, real without being actual, ideal without being abstract, then instantly the permanent and characteristic essence hidden in things is freed and our true being which has for long seemed dead but was not so in other ways awakes and revives, thanks to this celestial nourishment</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;) While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble [[Plato]]'s forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>36</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See &quot;The Method of Dramatization&quot; in ''Desert Islands'', and &quot;Actual and Virtual&quot; in ''Dialogues II''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Thus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a ''transcendental empiricism'', alluding to Kant and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], experience only makes sense when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality)</span>
				<span class='text'>Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause)</span>
				<span class='text'>Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see below, ''[[#Epistemology|Epistemology]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>imultaneously, Deleuze claims that [[univocity of being|being is univocal]], i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Deleuze borrows the doctrine of ''[[ontological]] [[univocity]]'' from the medieval philosopher [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]) held that when one says that &quot;God is good&quot;, God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness</span>
				<span class='text'>Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that &quot;God is good&quot;, the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says &quot;Jane is good&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>That is, God only differs from us in degree, and properties such as [[good and evil|goodness]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[reason]], and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea</span>
				<span class='text'>eleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one [[substance theory|substance]], [[God]] or [[Nature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating [[process philosophy|process]], an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding</span>
				<span class='text'>Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula &quot;[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] = [[monism]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''A Thousand Plateaus'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is Deleuze's most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'' (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), a &quot;[[body without organs]]&quot;; in ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' (1991), a &quot;[[plane of immanence]]&quot; or &quot;chaosmos&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>== Epistemology ===Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical [[epistemology]], or what he calls a transformation of &quot;the image of thought&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Edmund Husserl]], misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business</span>
				<span class='text'>Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense</span>
				<span class='text'>Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories</span>
				<span class='text'>Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible</span>
				<span class='text'>By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a &quot;thought without image&quot;, a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either</span>
				<span class='text'>It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation</span>
				<span class='text'>Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors</span>
				<span class='text'>Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>262</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Deleuze's peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>136</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Likewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of [[concept]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato's [[theory of forms|ideas]], Descartes's ''[[cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'', or Kant's doctrine of the faculties</span>
				<span class='text'>A philosophical concept &quot;posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''What Is Philosophy?'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Deleuze's view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of [[John Locke]] or [[Willard Van Orman Quine]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways</span>
				<span class='text'>While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls &quot;percepts&quot; and &quot;affects&quot;), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the [[speed of light]] or [[absolute zero]] (which Deleuze calls &quot;functives&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others:&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>123</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, &quot;separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>125</span>
				<span class='text'>Cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza's claim that the mind and the body are different modes expressing the same substance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as &quot;is it true?&quot; or &quot;what is it?&quot;, Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: &quot;what does it do?&quot; or &quot;how does it work?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>21: &quot;We're strict functionalists: what we're interested in is how something works&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Values ===In ethics and politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key</span>
				<span class='text'>In a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract [[natural rights]] or duties set by themselves or a God</span>
				<span class='text'>Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word &quot;individual&quot; suggests)</span>
				<span class='text'>Guided by the [[Ethical naturalism|naturalistic ethics]] of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers</span>
				<span class='text'>In the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of &quot;[[desiring-production]]&quot; (a concept combining features of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] drives and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Labour economics|labor]]) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and [[capitalism]] (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification)</span>
				<span class='text'>Deleuze, following [[Karl Marx|Marx]], welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market</span>
				<span class='text'>ut how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or [[Immanence|immanent]]: to live well is to fully express one's power, to go to the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do</span>
				<span class='text'>To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance</span>
				<span class='text'>The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge</span>
				<span class='text'>If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Essays Critical and Clinical'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Deleuze's interpretations ===Deleuze's studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposefully heterodox</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', for example, Deleuze claims that [[Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' is an attempt to rewrite Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>88</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; even though Nietzsche nowhere mentions the First Critique in the ''Genealogy'', and the ''Genealogy'''s moral topics are far removed from the epistemological focus of Kant's book</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, Deleuze claims that univocity is the organizing principle of Spinoza's philosophy, despite the total absence of the term from any of Spinoza's works</span>
				<span class='text'>Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as &quot;[[buggery]] (''enculage'')&quot;, as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p</span>

Zizek’s Critique of Deleuze&quot;, ''Parrhesia'' 1 (2006): 62-87) describes the &quot;popular topic&quot; of Deleuze's &quot;notorious remarks&quot;; Donald Callen (in &quot;The Difficult Middle&quot;, ''Rhizomes'' 10 (Spring 2005)) describes &quot;intellectual buggery&quot; as &quot;what Deleuze himself famously said about his encounters with the works of other philosophers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's ''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X|Study after Velázquez]]''—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon &quot;gets Velasquez wrong&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>136: &quot;The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, ''pace'' critics such as [[Alan Sokal]]: &quot;I'm not saying that [[Alain Resnais|Resnais]] and [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]], or [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] and [[René Thom|Thom]], are doing the same thing</span>
				<span class='text'>I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images</span>
				<span class='text'>And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>124-125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Reception ==In the 1960s, Deleuze's portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of &quot;left-wing Nietzscheanism&quot; as an intellectual stance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, e</span>

				<span class='text'> the approving reference to Deleuze's Nietzsche study in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay &quot;''Différance''&quot;, or [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s monograph ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle'', dedicated to Deleuze</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  His books ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' (1969) led [[Michel Foucault]] to declare that &quot;one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, &quot;Theatrum Philosophicum&quot;, ''Critique'' 282, p</span>
				<span class='text'>885</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault's comment was &quot;a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in a later interview, Deleuze commented: &quot;I don't know what Foucault meant, I never asked him&quot; (''Negotiations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>88)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;)  In the 1970s, the ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric,&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes in the same sentence: &quot;one is thus traversed, broken, fucked by the socius&quot; (''Anti-Oedipus'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>347)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from Freud, [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], and dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; though neither Deleuze nor Guattari described their work in those terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise in the English-speaking academy, Deleuze's work is typically classified as [[continental philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Simon Glendinning, ''The Idea of Continental Philosophy'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Deleuze has attracted critics as well</span>
				<span class='text'>The following list is not exhaustive, and gives only the briefest of summaries</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''Modern French Philosophy'' (1979), [[Vincent Descombes]] argues that Deleuze's account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'') is incoherent, and that his analysis of history in ''Anti-Oedipus'' is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descombes|first=Vincent|title=Modern French Philosophy|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-29672-2|pages=155, 175–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;In ''What Is Neostructuralism?'' (1984), [[Manfred Frank]] claims that Deleuze's theory of individuation as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>n &quot;The Decline and Fall of French Nietzscheo-Structuralism&quot; (1994), [[Pascal Engel]] presents a wholesale condemnation of Deleuze's thought</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Engel, Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: &quot;When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it</span>
				<span class='text'>You should not question it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, ''European Philosophy and the American Academy'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In ''The Mask of Enlightenment'' (1995), [[Stanley Rosen]] objects to Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche's [[eternal return]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-49546-6|pages=ix-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;In ''Deleuze: The Clamor of Being'' (1997), [[Alain Badiou]] claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom relentlessly [[monism|monist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic [[fatalism]] akin to ancient [[Stoicism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Badiou|first=Alain|title=Deleuze: the clamor of being|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=0-8166-3139-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;In ''Reconsidering Difference'' (1997), [[Todd May]] argues that Deleuze's claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> his monism</span>
				<span class='text'>However, May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis, and accept a [[Wittgenstein]]ian [[holism]] without significantly altering his practical philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', Alan Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms, particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his philosophical system</span>
				<span class='text'>(But see above, ''[[#Deleuze's interpretations|Deleuze's interpretations]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> Sokal and Bricmont state that they don't object to metaphorical reasoning, including with mathematical concepts, but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise</span>
				<span class='text'>They give examples of mathematical concepts being &quot;abused&quot; by taking them out of their intended meaning; rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to banality, truism or nonsense</span>
				<span class='text'>In their opinion, Deleuze and Guattari used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader</span>
				<span class='text'>Sokal and Bricmont state that they only dealt with the &quot;abuse&quot; of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuze's wider contributions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Žižek, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>32, 20, and 184</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to &quot;just another&quot; substance and thereby failing to grasp the nothingness that, according to Lacan and Žižek, defines subjectivity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Žižek, p</span>
				<span class='text'>68: &quot;This brings us to the topic of the ''subject'' that, according to Lacan, emerges in the interstice of the 'minimal difference,' in the minimal gap between two signifiers</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, the subject is 'a nothingness, a void, which exists</span>
				<span class='text'> </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>This, then, is what Deleuze seems to get wrong in his reduction of the subject to (just another) substance</span>
				<span class='text'>Far from belonging to the level of actualization, of distinct entities in the order of constituted reality, the dimension of the 'subject' designates the ''reemergence of the virtual within the order of actuality''</span>
				<span class='text'>'Subject' names the unique space of the explosion of virtuality within constituted reality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, Žižek finds, are precisely those concepts closest to Žižek's own ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''Out of this World: Deleuze and the Philosophy of Creation'' (2006), [[Peter Hallward]] argues that Deleuze's insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into, and is supremely indifferent to, the material, actual conditions of existence</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Hallward claims that Deleuze's thought is literally other-worldly, aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the [[theophany|theophanic]] self-creation of nature</span>
