				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Puccini-it-Cathedral /&gt; However, when Michele Puccini died in 1864, his son Giacomo was only six years old, and thus not capable of taking over his father's job</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; As a child, he nevertheless participated in the musical life of the Cattedrale di San Martino, as a member of the boys' choir and later as a substitute organist</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; One of Puccini's uncles, Fortunato Magi, supervised his musical education</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini got a diploma from the Pacini School of Music in Lucca in 1880, having studied there with his uncle Fortunato, and later with Carlo Angeloni, who had also instructed [[Alfredo Catalani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A grant from the [[Margherita of Savoy|Italian Queen Margherita]], and assistance from another uncle, Nicholas Cerù, provided the funds necessary for Puccini to continue his studies at the [[Milan Conservatory]],&lt;ref name=Dry /&gt;&lt;ref name=Streatfield /&gt; where he studied composition with [[Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti]], [[Amilcare Ponchielli]], and [[Antonio Bazzini]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini studied at the conservatory for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1880, at the age of 21, Puccini composed his ''[[Messa (Puccini)|Mass]]'', which marks the culmination of his family's long association with [[Christian music|church music]] in his native Lucca</span>

				<span class='text'>group=n}}==Early career and first operas==Puccini wrote an orchestral piece called the ''Capriccio sinfonica'' as a thesis composition for the Milan Conservatory</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini's teachers Ponchielli and Bazzini were impressed by the work, and it was performed at a student concert at the conservatory</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini's work was favorably reviewed in the Milanese publication ''Perseveranza'',&lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; and thus Puccini began to build a reputation as a young composer of promise in Milanese music circles</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Le Villi''===After the premiere of the ''Capriccio sinfonica'', Ponchielli and Puccini discussed the possibility that Puccini's next work might be an opera</span>
				<span class='text'>Ponchielli invited Puccini to stay at his villa, where Puccini was introduced to another young man named Fernando Fontana</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; Puccini and Fontana agreed to collaborate on an opera, for which Fontana would provide the [[libretto]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The work, ''[[Le Villi]]'', was entered into a competition sponsored by the Sozogno music publishing company in 1883 (the same competition in which [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' was the winner in 1889)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; Although it did not win, ''Le Villi'' was later staged at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]], premiering on 31 May 1884</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; The performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt; Revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, ''Le Villi'' was performed at [[La Scala]] in Milan, on 24 January 1885</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Ricordi did not publish the score until 1887, hindering further performance of the work</span>

				<span class='text'>Work was begun in 1884 when Fontana began working out the scenario for the libretto</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt; Puccini finished primary composition in 1887 and orchestration in 1888</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt; The work was withdrawn for revisions after its third performance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt; In a Milanese newspaper, Giulio Ricordi published a defense of Puccini's skill as a composer, while criticizing Fontana's libretto</span>
				<span class='text'>A revised version met with success at the [[Teatro di Giglio]] in Puccini's native Lucca on 5 September 1891</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt; In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt; Puccini made further revisions in 1901 and 1905, but the work never achieved popularity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt; Without the personal support of Ricordi, ''Edgar'' might have cost Puccini his career</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini had eloped with his former piano student, the married Elvira Gemignani, and Ricordi's associates were willing to turn a blind eye to his life style as long as he was successful</span>
				<span class='text'>When ''Edgar'' failed, they suggested to Ricordi that he should drop Puccini, but Ricordi said that he would stay with him and continued his allowance until his next opera</span>

				<span class='text'>49&lt;/ref&gt;===''Manon Lescaut''===On commencing his next opera, ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', Puccini announced that he would write his own libretto so that &quot;no fool of a librettist&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carner, ''Puccini: A Critical Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; could spoil it</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricordi persuaded him to accept [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]] as his librettist, but Puccini soon asked Ricordi to remove him from the project</span>
				<span class='text'>Four other librettists were then involved with the opera, as Puccini constantly changed his mind about the structure of the piece</span>
				<span class='text'>It was almost by accident that the final two, [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]], came together to complete the opera</span>
				<span class='text'>'Manon Lescaut'' premiered at the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio]] in Turin on 2 February 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Night of Lescaut premiere&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Arte e Scienze|newspaper=La Stampa|date=2 February 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; By coincidence, Puccini's first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi's last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which was first performed on 9 February 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Night of Lescaut premiere&quot; /&gt; In anticipation of the premiere, ''[[La Stampa]]'' wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom &quot;great hopes&quot; had a real basis (&quot;{{Lang|it|un giovane che e tra i pochi sul quale le larghe speranze non siano benigne illusioni}}&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Night of Lescaut premiere&quot; /&gt; Because of the failure of ''Edgar'', however, a failure of ''Manon Lescaut'' could have jeopardized Puccini's future as a composer</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Giulio Ricordi, head of Casa Ricordi, was supportive of Puccini while ''Manon Lescaut'' was still in development, the Casa Ricordi board of directors was considering cutting off Puccini's financial support</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Amadeus&quot;&gt;{{Almanacco|match=La bohème}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a popular success, and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written</span>
				<span class='text'>he libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murger's episodic novel combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with the tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mimí</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini's own life as young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto</span>
				<span class='text'>During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before ''Manon Lescaut'', he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in ''La bohème'', including chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome ({{Lang|it|Congregazione di caritá}}), he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuova Antologia&quot; /&gt; Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Dry /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuova Antologia&quot; /&gt; Puccini himself commented: &quot;I lived that ''Bohème'', when there wasn't yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(&quot;{{Lang|it|Quella Bohème io l’ho vissuta, quando ancora non mi mulinava nel cervello l’idea di cercarvi l’argomento per un’opera in musica</span>
				<span class='text'>}&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuova Antologia&quot; /&gt;Puccini's composition of ''La bohème'' was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo</span>
				<span class='text'> In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murger's work</span>
				<span class='text'> Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have &quot;priority&quot; on the subject (although Murger's work was in the public domain)</span>
				<span class='text'> Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallo's project, and wrote: &quot;Let him compose</span>
				<span class='text'> I will compose</span>
				<span class='text'> The audience will decide</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Phillips-Matz /&gt;  Puccini's opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favorite, while Leoncavallo's version of the story was quick to fade into obscurity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Girardi /&gt;===''Tosca''===Puccini's next work after ''La bohème'' was ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900), arguably Puccini's first foray into ''[[verismo]]'', the realistic depiction of many facets of real life including violence</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini had been considering an opera on this theme since he saw the play ''Tosca'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] in 1889, when he wrote to his publisher, [[Giulio Ricordi]], begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: &quot;I see in this ''Tosca'' the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips-Matz, pp</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|right|Puccini photographed in 1908]]The music of ''Tosca'' employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by Wagner</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Phillips-Matz, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the subjects that Puccini seriously considered, but abandoned, were: ''Cristoforo Sly'', ''Anima Allegra'' (based on the play ''El genio alegre'' by Serafín and Joaquín Álvarez Quintero), ''Two Little Wooden Shoes'' (''I due zoccoletti'') (a short story by Maria Louise Ramé, a</span>

				<span class='text'>Puccini's long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 (in the opening months of the war) during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips-Matz&quot; /&gt; Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on ''La rondine'' under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1914 (although the contract was ultimately cancelled)</span>
				<span class='text'>Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war</span>

				<span class='text'>The work, ''Inno a Roma'' (Hymn to Rome), was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome</span>

				<span class='text'> He consciously attempted to 'update' his style to keep pace with new trends, but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style</span>
				<span class='text'> One critic, Anthony Davis has stated: &quot;Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccini's music</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis - Late Style&quot; /&gt;  Davis  also identifies, however, a &quot;stylistic pluralism&quot; in Puccini's work, including influences from &quot;the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of Wagnerian chromaticism</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis - Late Style&quot; /&gt;  In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in Turandot</span>
				<span class='text'>ll of Puccini's operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these</span>
				<span class='text'> At the same time, Puccini's work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more &quot;through-composed&quot; or integrated construction</span>
				<span class='text'> His works are strongly melodic</span>

				<span class='text'>''Cavalleria rusticana'', ''Pagliacci'', and ''Andrea Chénier'' are uniformly considered to be ''verismo'' operas</span>

				<span class='text'> [[Grove Music Online]] described Puccini's strengths as a composer as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Puccini succeeded in mastering the orchestra as no other Italian had done before him, creating new forms by manipulating structures inherited from the great Italian tradition, loading them with bold harmonic progressions which had little or nothing to do with what was happening then in Italy, though they were in step with the work of French, Austrian and German colleagues</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ravenni and Girardi, #11 ''Assessment''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his work on Puccini, [[Julian Budden]] describes Puccini as a gifted and original composer, noting the innovation hidden in the popularity of works such as &quot;Che gelida manina&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes the aria in musical terms (the signature embedded in the harmony for example), and points out that its structure was rather unheard of at the time, having three distinct musical paragraphs that nonetheless form a complete and coherent whole</span>
				<span class='text'>This gumption in musical experimentation was the essence of Puccini's style, as evidenced in his diverse settings and use of the [[Motif (music)|motif]] to express ideas beyond those in the story and text</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2012}}Puccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult</span>

				<span class='text'>Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles</span>
				<span class='text'>Be it remembered, however, that Verdi's melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder</span>
				<span class='text'>The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original</span>
				<span class='text'>So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article</span>
				<span class='text'>Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature</span>
