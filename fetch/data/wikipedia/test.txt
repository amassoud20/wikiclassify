The Academy Awards or Oscars is an annual United States of America|American awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the film industry The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette officially called the Academy Award of Merit which has become commonly known by its nickname Oscar The awards first presented in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel are overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)

The awards ceremony was first televised in 1953 and is now seen live in more than 200 countries The Oscars is the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents the Emmy Awards for television the Tony Awards for theatre and the Grammy Awards for music and recording are modeled after the Academy Awards

The 86th Academy Awards ceremony was held on March 2 2014 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles later than usual as to not clash with the Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia The 87th Academy Awards ceremony was held on February 22 2015 Historically given during the first quarter of the new year the awards honor achievements for cinematic accomplishments for the preceding year For example 12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave was awarded Best Picture for 2013 although the Oscar ceremony was conducted in 2014 As of the 87th awards ceremony held in 2015 a total of 2947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award



The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16 1929 at a private dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel name=history The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($ in  dollars) Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1927â€“28 period The ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes

Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930 Since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards name=history This method was used until an occasion when the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners name=history

The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history At that time the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films With the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years name=history

At the 29th ceremony held on March 27 1957 the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced Until then foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award

The 74th Academy Awards held in 2002 presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature



Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award the Gordon E Sawyer Award the Academy Scientific and Technical Award the Academy Award for Technical Achievement the John A Bonner Medal of Commendation and the Student Academy Award) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette) the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette Made of gold-plated britannia metal|britannium on a black metal base it is 135&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall weighs 85&amp;nbsp;lb (385&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusades|crusader's sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors Writers Directors Producers and Technicians

No model was used during the design process of the statuette name=:0 Sculptor George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Cedric Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 925 percent tin and 75 percent copper and then gold-plated it The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the CW Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in Batavia Illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes Since 1983 approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer RS Owens &amp; Company (https:newsgooglecomnewspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=20090127&amp;id=n_UlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ff0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=69312001573 Lodi News-Sentinel)!--DEAD LINK url=http:wwwgooglecomhostednewsaparticleALeqM5jL1cVq-oMS6qeuUPUWfAQpf85fewD95V3MV80--!--DEAD LINK archiveurl=http:wwwwebcitationorg5e8JdSe3B |archivedate=27 January 2009-- It takes between three to four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes name=:0 

In support of the American effort in World War II the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended



The origin of the name Oscar is disputed One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time (magazine)|Time magazine article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards  Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932 Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary Margaret Herrick first saw the award in 1931 and made erence to the statuette's reminding her of her Uncle Oscar (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce)Oscar in the Oxford English Dictionary June 2008 Draft Revision Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar' The trophy was officially dubbed the Oscar in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences


To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates Until 2010 winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied Since 2010 winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony In 2010 the RS Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony bearing the names of every potential winner The 175 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards


Since 1950 the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1 If a winner uses to agree to this stipulation then the Academy keeps the statuette Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums(Levy 2003 pg 28)  In December 2011 Orson Welles' 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy On December 20 2011 it sold in an online auction for US$861542 name=Welles' Oscar sold

In 1992 Harold Russell needed money for his wife's medical expenses In a controversial decision he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions and on August 6 1992 in New York City the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60500 Russell defended his action saying I don't know why anybody would be critical My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons The movie will be here even if Oscar isn't Harold Russell is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar

While the Oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market Mike Todd|Michael Todd's grandson tried to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy which keeps them in its treasury(Levy 2003 pg 29)


Since 2004 Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January Prior to that the results were announced in early February


The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of 5783 

Academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production Actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering 1311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures

New membership proposals are considered annually The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6000 voting members While the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then

In 2012 the results of a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership Of the 5100+ active voters confirmed 94% were Caucasian 77% were male and 54% were found to be over the age of 60 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%)

In May 2011 the Academy sent a letter advising its 6000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013


According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of 1 January to midnight at the end of 31 December in Los Angeles County California and play for seven consecutive days to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film) For example the 2009 Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture winner The Hurt Locker was actually first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 81st Academy Awards|2008 awards as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009 thus qualifying for the 82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm film|35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frames or 48&amp;nbsp;frames progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year The form includes the production credits for all related categories Then each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases

In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members For most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (ie only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc) In all major categories voters use an Instant-runoff voting|instant run-off voting ballot with potential nominees rewarded in the single transferable vote tally for having strong supporters who rank them first There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like Foreign Film Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches In the special case of Best Picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category Foreign films must include English subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year

The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including Best Picture

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders For example a producer of the 2010 Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as front-runner (The Hurt Locker eventually won)

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees It is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during November or December of the previous year This is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast)

The Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in Alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996) Canada the United Kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys Golden Globes and Grammy Award|Grammys) are broadcast live in the Eastern &amp; Central time zones but are on Broadcast delay|tape delay on the West Coast and might not air the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised) The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources
The Awards show was first televised in 1953 on NBC which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network took over televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970 after which NBC resumed the broadcasts ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020 The first countries to broadcast the Academy Awards on television aside from the United States were Canada the United Kingdom and Mexico; the latter two countries did not broadcast the live show and Mexico did not carry the live event until 1964 By 1954 seven other countries namely Brazil Cuba Venezuela West Germany Belgium the Netherlands and France were already broadcasting the Awards show although previously filmed into a condensed 60-minute version called the International Edition of the Academy Awards The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in 1970 but only two South American countries Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event By that time the television rights to the Awards show were sold in 50 countries A decade later the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to 60 countries and by 1984 the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe Africa and the Middle East which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories there was already available a previously filmed or taped 90-minute version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories However several Asian and Australasian countries such as Japan Hong Kong South Korea Singapore Malaysia Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late 1970s AMPAS still produces a condensed 90-minute version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive

After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship which would cut into the Academy Awards audience The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period Some years the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public Advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history with 47 wins and 195 nominations

After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time Zone|Eastern6:00 pm Pacific Time Zone|Pacific in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern5:30&amp;nbsp;pm Pacific The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlierhttps:newsgooglecomnewspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19980701&amp;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=663743314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night Reading Eagle â€“ 1 July 1998; From Google News Archive For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box officehttps:newsgooglecomnewspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=19990319&amp;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=12244570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday The Item â€“ 19 March 1999 Google News Archive

Originally scheduled for April 8 1968 the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr On March 30 1981 the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day after Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington DC

In 1993 an In Memoriam segment was introduced name=fawcett honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent lection instead

In terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours The first Oscars in 1929 lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes At the other end of the spectrum the 2000 ceremony lasted four hours and four minutesEhbar Ned (February 28 2014) Did you know? Metro New York City p 18 In 2010 the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' Oscar speech|acceptance speeches must not run past 45&amp;nbsp;seconds This according to organizer Bill Mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show â€“ overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion

The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season However such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail) Also a January ceremony would have to compete with National Football League playoff games




Historically the Oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy More than 5725 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998 the year of Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars The 76th Academy Awards ceremony in which The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 4356 million viewers name=usatoday_oscar The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date however was the 42nd Academy Awards (Best Picture Midnight Cowboy) which drew a 434% household rating on 7 April 1970

By contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings The 78th Academy Awards which awarded low-budgeted independent film Crash (2004 film)|Crash (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$534 million) generated an audience of 3864 million with a household rating of 2291%  In 2008 the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 3176 million viewers on average with an 1866% household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film (No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men)

In 1929 the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel From 1930 to 1943 the ceremony alternated between two venues: the Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles

TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948 The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what was the Academy's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood

From 1950 to 1960 the awards were presented at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre With the advent of television the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica California in 1961 By 1969 the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center

In 2002 the Kodak Theatre (now known as the Dolby Theatre) became the current venue of the presentation








In the first year of the awards the Best Directing award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy) At times the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and ComedyMusical) From the 1930s through the 1960s the Art Direction (now Production Design) Cinematography and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films) Prior to 2012 the Production Design award was called Art Direction while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup

Another award entitled the Academy Award for Best Original Musical is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued However due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year it has not been awarded since 1984 (when Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain won)





The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories To date the following proposed categories have been rejected:
 Best Casting: rejected in 1999!--erence to suite101com removed blacklisted site--
 Best Stunt Coordination: rejected every year from 1991 to 2012
 Best Title Design: rejected in 1999!--erence to suite101com removed blacklisted site--

Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the Oscar season This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality No independent films have received the award (though a few were nominated) and no actors working outside of the studio system for a picture have won the award for their work in that picture William Friedkin an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009 describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself

Tim Dirks editor of American Movie Classics|AMC's filmsiteorg has written of the Academy Awards





Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the US the last three months of the calendar year The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded From 1927 to 2001 around 49% of Best Picture nominated films had been categorized as a drama and out of the 432 films to be analyzed within that time 47% of the winning films were in fact dramas This has led to the coining of the term 'Oscar bait' describing such movies This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience eg by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues


Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement for past mistakes or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work


Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and used to accept their Oscars The first to do so was Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer) Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild name=DYK George C Scott became the second person to use his award (Best Actor in 1970 for Patton (film)|Patton) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony Scott described it as a 'meat parade' saying 'I don't want any part of it The third was Marlon Brando who used his award (Best Actor for 1972's The Godfather) citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms name=DYK
