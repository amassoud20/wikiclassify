with longtime friend  derleth in 1939 founded   its initial objective was to publish the works of h p lovecraft with whom derleth had corresponded since his teenage years at the same time he began teaching a course in american regional literature at the university of wisconsin
in 1941 he became literary editor of  newspaper in  a post he held until his resignation in 1960 his hobbies included fencing swimming chess  and comic strips derleth reportedly deployed the funding from his guggenheim fellowship to bind his comic book collection most recently valued in the millions of dollars rather than to travel abroad as the award intended  derleths true  however was hiking the terrain of his native wisconsin lands and observing and recording nature with an expert eye
derleth once wrote of his writing methods i write very swiftly from 750000 to a million words yearly very little of it pulp material
in 1948 he was elected president of the associated fantasy publishers at the  in  name chtr480926

derleth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime
derleth wrote an expansive series of novels short stories journals poems and other works about sac prairie whose prototype is  derleth intended this series to comprise up to 50 novels telling the projected life story of the region from the 19th century onwards with analogies to s  and s 
this and other early work by derleth made him a well known figure among the regional literary figures of his time early  winners  and  as well as sinclair lewis the last both an admirer and critic of derleth
as edward wagenknecht wrote in cavalcade of the american novel what mr derleth has that is lackingin modern novelists generally is a country he belongs he writes of a land and a people that are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh in his fictional world there is a unity much deeper and more fundamental than anything that can be conferred by an ideology it is clear too that he did not get the best and most fictionally useful part of his background material from research in the library like scott in his border novels he gives rather the impression of having drunk it in with his mothers milk
jim stephens editor of an august derleth reader 1992 argues what derleth accomplishedwas to gather a wisconsin mythos which gave respect to the ancient fundament of our contemporary life
the author inaugurated the sac prairie saga with four novellas comprising place of hawks published by loring amp mussey in 1935 at publication  wrote certainly with this book mr derleth may be added to the american writers of distinction 
derleths first novel still is the summer night was published two years later by the famous  editor  and was the second in his sac prairie saga
village year the first in a series of journals–meditations on nature midwestern village american life and more–was published in 1941 to praise from  a book of instant sensitive responsivenessrecreates its scene with acuteness and beauty and makes an unusual contribution to the americana of the present day the  observed that derlethdeepens the value of his village setting by presenting in full the enduring natural background with the people projected against this the writing comes to have the quality of an old flemish picture humanity lively and amusing and loveable in the foreground and nature magnificent beyond james grey writing in the  concluded derleth has achieved a kind of prose equivalent of the spoon river anthology
in the same year evening in spring was published by charles scribners amp sons this work derleth considered among his finest what  called this beautiful little love story is an autobiographical novel of first love beset by small town religious bigotry the work received critical praise  considered it a story told with tenderness and charm while the chicago tribune  concluded its as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told with rekindled emotion of the pangs of pain and the sharp clear sweetness of a boys first love helen constance white wrote in the capital times that it was the best articulated the most fully disciplined of his stories
these were followed in 1943 with shadow of night a scribners novel of which  wrote structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewela  of the first order and an adventure tale that is unique and inspiriting
in november 1945 however derleths work was attacked by his one time admirer and mentor sinclair lewis writing in  lewis observed it is a proof of mr derleths merit that he makes one want to make the journey and see his particular avalon the  shining among its islands and the castles of baron pierneau and hercules dousman  he is a champion and a justification of regionalism  yet he is also a burly bounding bustling self confident opinionated and highly sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholoy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues  if he could ever be persuaded that he isnt half as good as he thinks he is if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil he might become twice as good as he thinks he is–which would about rank him with homer derleth good humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater on the back cover of his 1948 country journal village daybook
a lighter side to the sac prairie saga is a series of quasi autobiographical short stories known as the gus elker stories amusing tales of country life that  derleths last editor said were models of construction andfused with some of the most memorable characters in american literature most were written between 1934 and the late 1940s though the last tail of the dog was published in 1959 and won the scholastic magazine short story award for the year the series was collected and republished in country matters in 1996
walden west published in 1961 is considered by many derleths finest work  this prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of sac prairie journals but is organized around three themes the persistence of memorythe sounds and odors of the countryand thoreaus observation that the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation  a blend of nature writing philosophic musings and caul observation of the people and place of sac prairie of this work george vukelich author of north country notebook writes derleths walden west isthe equal of sherwood andersons winesburgohio thornton wilders our town and edgar lee masters spoon river anthology  this was followed eight years later by return to walden west a work of similar quality but with a more noticeable environmentalist edge to the writing notes critic 
a close literary relative of the sac prairie saga was derleths wisconsin saga which comprises several historical novels
detective fiction represented another substantial body of derleths work most notable among this work was a series of 70 stories in affectionate pastiche of  whose creator sir  he admired greatly these included one published novel as well mr fairlies final journey the series features a sherlock holmes styled british detective named  of  in london the series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as     and 
in his 1944 volume the misadventures of sherlock holmes ellery queen wrote of derleths the norcross riddle an early pons story how many budding authors not even old enough to vote could have captured the spirit and atmosphere with as much fidelity queen adds and his choice of the euphonic solar pons is an appealing addition to the fascinating lore of sherlockian nomenclature  vincent starrett in his foreword to the 1964 edition of the casebook of solar pons wrote that the series is as sparkling a galaxy of sherlockian pastiches as we have had since the canonical entertainments came to an end
despite close similarities to doyles creation pons lived in the post  era in the decade of the 1920s though derleth never wrote a pons novel to equal the hound of the baskervilles editor peter ruber wrote derleth produced more than a few solar pons stories almost as good as sir arthurs and many that had better plot construction
although these stories were a form of diversion for derleth ruber who edited  2000 argued because the stories were generally of such high quality they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery ficton rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of sherlock holmes
some of the stories were self published through a new imprint called  an appellation of humorous significance to holmesian scholars  for approximately a decade an active supporting group was the praed street irregulars patterned after the 
in 1946 conan doyles two sons made some attempts to force derleth to cease publishing the solar pons series but the efforts were unsuccessful and eventually withdrawnpeter ruber http  wwwbatteredboxcom augustderlethmycroft finaladventuresolarpondhtm introduction in august derleth the final adventures of solar pons shelburne ont mampm 1998 
derleths mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in sac prairie and featuring judge peck as the central character
derleth wrote many and varied childrens works including biographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer  as well as  and   arguably most important among his works for younger readers however is the steve and sim mystery series  the ten volume series is set in sac prairie of the 1920s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the sac prairie saga as well as an extension of derleths body of mystery fiction  robert hood writing in the new york times said steve and sim the major characters are twentieth century cousins of huck finn and tom sawyer derleths minor characters little gems of comic drawing the first novel in the series the moon tenders does in fact involve a rafting adventure down the  which led regional writer  to suggest the novel was one that older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth the connection to the sac prairie saga was noted by the  once again a small midwest community in 1920s is depicted with perception skill and dry humor
derleth was a correspondent and friend of  – when lovecraft wrote about le comte derlette in  it was in homage to derleth  derleth invented the term cthulhu mythos to describe the fictional universe described in the series of stories shared by lovecraft and other writers in his circle
when lovecraft died in 1937 derleth and  assembled a collection of lovecrafts stories and tried to get them published existing publishers showed little interest so derleth and wandrei founded  in 1939 for that purpose the name of the company derived from lovecrafts fictional town of   which features in many of his stories in 1939 arkham house published  a huge collection that contained most of lovecrafts known short stories derleth and wandrei soon expanded arkham house and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book  a collection of some of derleths own horror stories was published  in 1941
following lovecrafts death derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by lovecraft these were published in weird tales and later in book form under the byline h p lovecraft and august derleth with derleth calling himself a posthumous collaborator this practice has raised objections in some quarters that derleth simply used lovecrafts name to market what was essentially his own fiction  ers to the posthumous collaborations as marking the beginning of perhaps the most disreputable phase of derleths activitiesjoshi h p lovecraft a life necronomicon press 1996 p638 
a significant number of  fans and critics such as mosig h p lovecraft myth maker 1976 collected in mosig at last necronomicon press 1997  joshi h p lovecraft a life necronomicon press 1996 pp 403–4  and the derleth mythos in meade amp penny frierson eds hpl 1972  were dissatisfied with derleths invention of the term cthulhu mythos lovecraft himself used yog sothothery and his presentation of lovecrafts fiction as having an overall pattern lecting derleths own christian world view which they contrast with lovecrafts depiction of an amoral universe however  points out that while derleths tales are distinct from lovecrafts in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil nevertheless the basis of derlerths systemization are found in lovecraft he also suggests that the differences can be over stated
blockquote
derleth was more optimistic than lovecraft in his conception of the mythos but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind there are indeed tales wherein derleths protagonists get off scot free like the shadow in the attic witches hollow or the shuttered room but often the hero is doomed eg the house in the valley the peabody heritage something in wood as in lovecraft and it must be remembered that an occasional lovecraftian hero does manage to overcome the odds eg in the horror in the museum the shunned house and the case of charles dexter ward 
http  crypt of cthulhucom lovecraftderlethhtm  
 blockquote
derleth also treated lovecrafts  as representatives of elemental forces creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework
such debates aside derleths founding of arkham house and his successful effort to rescue lovecraft from literary obscurity are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field for instance  has acknowledged derleths encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing careerfor example in the count of thirty necronomicon press 1993 p11  and  has cited derleth and arkham house as an inspiration for his own anthology kirby mccauley introduction dark forces 1980   arkham house and derleth published  the first book by  as well  cites the importance of derleth to his own lovecraftian work and contends in a 2009 introduction to derleths work that he was one of the first finest and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction
important as was derleths work to rescue hp lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of lovecrafts death derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own still frequently anthologized  the best of this work recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories–most of which were originally published in weird tales illustrates derleths original abilities in the genre  while derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts the compilers of these four anthologies including ramsey campbell note that the stories still resonate after more than fifty years
in 2009  selected derleth’s story the panelled room for inclusion in its two century retrospective of american fantastic tales
derleth also wrote many historical novels as part of both the sac prairie saga and the wisconsin saga  he also wrote history arguably most notable among these was the wisconsin river of a thousand isles published in 1942  the work was one in a series entitled the rivers of america conceived by writer constance lindsay skinner in the  as a series that would connect americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation skinner wanted the series to be written by artists not academicians derleth while not a trained historian was according to former wisconsin state historian william f thompson a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals   in the foreword to the 1985 reissue of the work by  thompson concluded no other writer of whatever background or training knew and understood his particular corner of the earth better than august derleth
derleth wrote several volumes of poems as well as biographies of   and 
he also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early 20th century comics such as   and  as well as a book of childrens poetry entitled a boys way and the foreword to  by  derleth also wrote under the  stephen grendon kenyon holmes and tally mason

camus was erring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays the principle of sticking up for your friends of valuing bravery and fair play camuss belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are potentially to serve their own needs name rhybma

two of camuss works were published posthumously the first entitled  1970 featured a character named patrice mersault comparable to nowiki nowikis meursault there is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books the second was an unfinished novel  1995 which camus was writing before he died the novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in 
during the war camus joined the  cell  which published an underground newspaper of the same name this group worked against the nazis and in it camus assumed the  beauchard camus became the papers editor in 1943 he first met sartre at the dress rehearsal of sartres play  in june 1943 by  
when   in august 1944 camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting soon after the event on 6 august 1945 he was one of the few french editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the united states dropping  he resigned from combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper after the war camus began frequenting the  on the  in paris with sartre and others he also toured the united states to lecture about french thought although he leaned  politically his strong criticisms of communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the  and eventually alienated sartre
in 1949 his tuberculosis returned whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years in 1951 he published  a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in france the book brought about the final split with sartre the dour reception depressed camus he began to translate plays
camuss first significant contribution to philosophy was his  he saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither which he expressed in  and incorporated into many of his other works such as  and  despite his split from his study partner sartre camus was still categorized as an  he specifically rejected that label in his essay enigma and elsewheresee the lyrical and critical essays of albert camus  the current confusion arises in part because many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of camuss practical ideas see resistance rebellion and death but his personal understanding of the world eg a benign indifference in  and every vision he had for its progress eg vanquishing the adolescent furies of history and society in  undoubtedly set him apart
in the 1950s camus devoted his efforts to  in 1952 he resigned from his work for  when the un accepted spain as a member under the leadership of  in 1953 he criticized  methods to crush a workers strike in  in 1956 he protested against similar methods in poland protests in  and the soviet repression of the hungarian revolution in october
camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world he wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with  the writer intellectual and founder of the league against capital punishment he was consistent in his call for non aggression in algeria name nybooks 
when the  began in 1954 camus was confronted with a moral dilemma he identified with the  such as his own parents and defended the french governments actions against the revolt he argued that the algerian uprising was an integral part of the new arab imperialism led by egypt and an anti western offensive orchestrated by russia to encircle europe and isolate the united statesactuelles iii chroniques algeriennes 1939–58  although favoring greater algerian  or even federation though not full scale independence he believed that the pieds noirs and arabs could co exist during the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish behind the scenes he began to work for imprisoned algerians who faced the death penalty name foley2014 
from 1955 to 1956 camus wrote for  in 1957 he was awarded the  for his important literary production which with clear sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times when he spoke to students at the  he defended his apparent inactivity in the algerian question he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother who still lived in algeria this led to further ostracism by french left wing intellectuals
camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life financed by the money he received with his nobel prize he adapted and directed for the stage   the play opened in january 1959 at the antoine theatre in paris it was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force 33 actors 4 hours long 7 sets 24 scenes  the walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations camus put the painter and set decorator  who had already illustrated several of camus novels    1948 ed in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets 
many writers have addressed the absurd each with his or her own interpretation of what the absurd is and what comprises its importance for example  recognizes the absurdity of individual experience while  explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching god rationally camus regretted the continued erence to himself as a philosopher of the absurd he showed less interest in the absurd shortly after publishing le mythe de sisyphe the myth of sisyphus to distinguish his ideas scholars sometimes er to the paradox of the absurd when erring to camus absurd
his early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays lenvers et lendroit betwixt and between in 1937 absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays noces nuptials in 1938 in these essays camus lects on the experience of the absurd in 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as  in the same year he released  a literary essay on the absurd he also wrote  about  a roman emperor pursuing an absurd logic the play was not performed until 1945
the turning point in camuss attitude to the absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous german friend written between july 1943 and july 1944 the first was published in the revue libre in 1943 the second in the cahiers de libération in 1944 and the third in the newspaper libertés in 1945 the four letters were published as lettres à un ami allemand letters to a german friend in 1945 and were included in the collection 
camus presents the reader with dualisms such as happiness and sadness dark and light life and death etc he emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality for camus this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness in le mythe dualism becomes a paradox we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universes silence while we can live with a dualism i can accept periods of unhappiness because i know i will also experience happiness to come we cannot live with the paradox i think my life is of great importance but i also think it is meaningless in le mythe camus investigates our experience of the absurd and asks how we live with it our life must have meaning for us to value it if we accept that life has no meaning and theore no value should we kill ourselves 
in le mythe camus suggests that creation of meaning would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort   but camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity has uncovered – if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem he gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap the alternative option namely suicide would entail another kind of leap where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms the human being camus points out however that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life and that it simply evades the problem yet again camus concludes that we must instead entertain both death and the absurd while never agreeing to their terms
meursault the absurdist hero of lÉtranger has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about however while camus possibly suggests that caligulas absurd reasoning is wrong the plays anti hero does get the last word as the author similarly exalts meursaults final moments 
camus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the absurd and always rejected nihilism as a valid response blockquoteif nothing had any meaning you would be right but there is something that still has a meaning second letter to a german friend december 1943 blockquote
camuss understanding of the absurd promotes public debate his various offerings entice us to think about the absurd and offer our own contribution concepts such as cooperation joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to camus though they are most likely sources of relative versus absolute meaning in  camus identifies rebellion or rather the values indicated by rebellion as a basis for human solidarity blockquotewhen he rebels a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical but for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains   blockquote
despite his opposition to the label camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism the problem of   he wrote there is only one really serious philosophical question and that is suicide deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy all other questions follow from that  camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life name platostanfordedu  in  camus seeks to identify the kinds of life that could be worth living despite their inherent meaninglessness name platostanfordedu 
throughout his life camus spoke out against and actively opposed  in its many forms  early on camus was active within the french resistance to the german occupation of france during world war ii even directing the famous resistance journal combat on the french collaboration with  occupiers he wrote now the only moral value is courage which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people  after liberation camus remarked this country does not need a  but a  name bronner2009  the reality of the bloody  soon changed his mind camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of  name bronner2009  
camuss well known falling out with sartre is linked to his opposition to communism camus detected a lexive totalitarianism in the  espoused by sartre in the name of radical  this was apparent in his work lhomme révolté the rebel which not only was an assault on the soviet police state but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the  a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech the blood of the hungarians commemorating the anniversary of the  an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the red army

christies first book  was published in 1920 and introduced the detective  who became a long running character in many of christies works appearing in 33 novels and 54 short stories
 was introduced in the short stories  in 1927 and was based on christies grandmother and her ealing cronies name  bbcdustyclues  both jane and gran always expected the worst of everyone and everything and were with almost frightening accuracy usually proved right name mallowan  marple appeared in 12 of christies novels during the second world war christie wrote two novels  and  intended as the last cases of these two great detectives hercule poirot and jane marple both books were sealed in a  for over thirty years and were released for publication by christie only at the end of her life when she realised that she could not write any more novels these publications came on the heels of the success of the  of murder on the orient express in 1974
christie became increasingly tired of poirot just as sir  did with his character  by the end of the 1930s christie wrote in her diary that she was finding poirot insufferable and by the 1960s she felt that he was an egocentric creep however unlike conan doyle christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular she saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked and the public liked poirot  
she did marry off poirots companion colonel hastings in an attempt to trim her cast commitments name mallowan  in contrast christie was fond of miss marple however the belgian detectives titles outnumber the marple titles more than two to one this is largely because christie wrote numerous poirot novels early in her career while  remained the sole marple novel until the 1940s christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both poirot and miss marple in a recording discovered and released in 2008 christie revealed the reason for this hercule poirot a complete egoist would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady name  bbcdustyclues 
poirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in  following the publication of curtain it appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 august 1975 
following the great success of curtain christie gave permission for the release of sleeping murder sometime in 1976 but died in january 1976 before the book could be released this may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the marple seriesampnbsp— for example colonel arthur bantry husband of miss marples friend dolly is still alive and well in sleeping murder despite the fact that he is noted as having died in books published earlier it may be that christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died 
in 2013 the christie family gave their full backing to the release of a new poirot story the monogram murders which was written by british author  
 
christies reputation as the queen of crime was built upon the large number of classic  that she introduced or for which she provided the most famous example christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure a murder is committed there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story discovering the most shocking twists towards the end culprits in christies mysteries have included children policemen narrators already deceased individuals and sometimes comprise no known suspects  or all of the suspects 
at the end in a christie hallmark the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room explains the course of his deductive reasoning and reveals the guilty party although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all such as  and  both rather  in nature name memezei kathy http  wwwjstororg stable 4619330 spinsters surveillance and speech the case of miss marple miss mole and miss jekyll journal of modern literature 302 2007 103–120  name bebeehler sharon a http  wwwjstororg stable 818612 close vs closed reading interpreting the clues the english journal 776 1998 39–43 
christie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons such as the passage of time retrospective cases in which the most important characters have already died or by active prescription such cases include     and  there are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of his plot sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective usually hercule poirot this occurs in            and  in the last of these curtain no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story
in  the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes hercule poirot however prevents this easy way out ensuring a trial and hanging in  the killers own death is intrinsic to the plot the  is when and how the killer actually died however stage film and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice for a variety of reasonsampnbsp– eg censors plot clarity and christies own changing tastes when christie adapted  into a stage play she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed this format was followed in film and television productions most famously the   film in  set in ancient  the culprit is killed in the act before he can claim another victim by one of the few surviving characters
in some stories the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered such as   and  according to  christie often but not always made the unlikeliest character the guilty party savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect 
seven stories are built around words from well known childrens s  by   by   by   by   by   by  and  by

christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work particularly before the end of the second world war when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly and particularly in regard to  jews non europeans and sometimes americans the last usually as impossibly naïve or uninformed for example she described hebraic men with hook noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery in the first editions of the collection  1930 in the short story the soul of the croupier in later editions the passage was edited to describe sallow men wearing same in  published as late as 1946 one of the more unsympathetic characters is a whitechapel jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a   a small woman with a thick nose henna red and a disagreeable voice to contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions christie sometimes showed foreigners as victims or potential victims at the hands of english malefactors such as respectively olga seminoff  and katrina reiger in the short story how does your garden grow jewish characters are often seen as un english such as oliver manders in  but they are rarely the culprits 
often she is affectionate or teasing with her prejudices after four years of war torn london christie hoped to return some day to syria which she described as gentle fertile country and its simple people who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life who are idle and gay and who have dignity good manners and a great sense of humour and to whom death is not terrible name mallowan

the plague french la peste is a novel by  published in 1947 that tells the story of a plague sweeping the algerian city of  it asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the  the characters in the book ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace
the novel is believed to be based on the cholera epidemic that killed a large percentage of orans population in 1849 following french colonization but the novel is placed in the 1940smagill 1989683  oran and its environs were struck by disease multiple times before camus published this novel  according to a research report by the  oran was decimated by the plague in 1556 and 1678 but all later outbreaks in 1921 185 cases 1931 76 cases and 1944 95 cases were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel
the plague is considered an  classic despite camus objection to the labelcamus in thody 1970345 in an interview on 15 november 1945 camus said no i am not an existentialist forsdick 2007119  the narrative tone is similar to  especially in  whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings the material often pointedly resonating as stark  of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition
camus included a dim witted character misreading  as a mystery novel as an oblique  the novel has been read as a ical treatment of the  to  occupation during world war ii
although camuss approach in the book is severe his narrator emphasizes the ideas that we ultimately have no control and irrationality of life is inevitable additionally he further illustrates the human reaction towards the absurd the plague represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the  a theory that camus himself helped to define
the text of the plague is divided into five parts
in the town of oran thousands of rats initially unnoticed by the populace begin to die in the streets hysteria develops soon afterward causing the local newspapers to report the incident authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the 
the main character dr bernard rieux lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the buildings concierge m michel a confidante dies from a fever dr rieux consults his colleague dr castel about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town they both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death however as more and more deaths quickly ensue it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic meanwhile rieuxs wife has been sent to a sanatorium in another city to be treated for an unrelated chronic illness
authorities including the pect are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take  official notices enacting control measures are posted but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation a special ward is opened at the hospital but its 80 beds are filled within three days as the death toll begins to rise more desperate measures are taken homes are quarantined corpses and burials are strictly supervised a supply of plague serum finally arrives but there is enough to treat only existing cases and the countrys emergency reserves are depleted when the daily number of deaths jumps to 30 the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared
the town is sealed off the town gates are shut rail travel is prohibited and all mail service is suspended the use of telephone lines is restricted only to urgent calls leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town the separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople who begin to feel isolated and introverted and the plague begins to affect various characters
one character raymond rambert devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in paris after city officials used his request to leave  he befriends some underground criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city  another character father paneloux uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of god punishing the citizens sinful nature his diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances cottard a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide but fearful of being arrested becomes wealthy as a major smuggler meanwhile dr rieux a vacationer jean tarrou and a civil servant joseph grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital
rambert informs tarrou of his escape plan but when tarrou tells him that there arw others in the city including dr rieux who have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind he then decides to join tarrou and dr rieux to help fight the epidemic
in mid august the situation continues to worsen people try to escape the town but some are shot by armed sentries violence and looting break out on a small scale and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew funerals are conducted with more and more speed no ceremony and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased the inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation despondent they waste away emotionally as well as physically
in september and october the town remains at the mercy of the plague rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wifes condition is worsening he also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work cottard on the other hand seems to flourish during the plague because it gives him a sense of being connected to others since everybody faces the same danger cottard and tarrou attend a performance of s opera  but the actor portraying orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance

paneloux who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague gives a second sermon he addresses the problem of an innocent childs suffering and says it is a test of a christians faith since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything he urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague
a few days after the sermon paneloux is taken ill his symptoms do not conform to those of the plague but the disease still proves fatal
tarrou and rambert visit one of the isolation camps where they meet othon when othons period of quarantine ends he chooses to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son tarrou tells rieux the story of his life and to take their mind off the epidemic the two men go swimming together in the sea grand catches the plague and instructs rieux to burn all his papers however grand makes an unexpected recovery and deaths from the plague start to decline

m othon m othon is a magistrate in oran he is tall and thin and as tarrou observes in his journal his small beady eyes narrow nose and hard straight mouth make him look like a well brought up owl othon treats his wife and children unkindly but after his son dies of the plague his character softens after he finishes his time at the isolation camp where he is sent because his son is infected he wants to return there because it would make him feel closer to his lost son however before othon can do this he contracts the plague and dies
father paneloux father paneloux is a learned well respected jesuit priest he is well known for having given a series of lectures in which he championed a pure form of christian doctrine and chastised his audience about their laxity during the first stage of the plague outbreak paneloux preaches a sermon at the cathedral he has a powerful way of speaking and he insists to the congregation that the plague is a scourge sent by god to those who have hardened their hearts against him however paneloux also claims that god is present to offer succor and hope later paneloux attends at the bedside of othons stricken son and prays that the boy may be spared after the boys death paneloux tells rieux that although the death of an innocent child in a world ruled by a loving god cannot be rationally explained it should nonetheless be accepted paneloux joins the team of volunteer workers and preaches another sermon saying that the death of the innocent child is a test of faith since god willed the childs death so the christian should will it too a few days after preaching this sermon paneloux is taken ill he uses to call for a doctor trusting in god alone and dies since his symptoms did not seem to resemble those of the plague rieux records his death as a doubtful case
the pect the pect believes at first that the talk of plague is a false alarm but on the advice of his medical association he authorises limited measures to combat it when thet do not work he tries to avoid responsibility saying he will ask the government for orders then he takes responsibility for tightening up the regulations relating to the plague and issues the order to close the town
raymond rambert raymond rambert is a journalist who is visiting oran to research a story on living conditions in the arab quarter of the town when the plague strikes he finds himself trapped in a city with which he feels he has no connection he misses his wife who is in paris and uses all his ingenuity and resourcefulness to persuade the city bureaucracy to allow him to leave when that fails he contacts smugglers who agree to help him escape for a fee of ten thousand francs however there is a hitch in the arrangements and by the time another escape plan is arranged rambert has changed his mind he decides to stay in the city and continue to help fight the plague saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he pursued a merely private happiness he now feels that he belongs in oran and that the plague is everyones business including his

dr richard dr richard is chairman of the oran medical association he is slow to recommend any action to combat the plague for fear of public alarm he does not want even to admit that the disease is the plague erring instead to a special type of fever
dr bernard rieux dr bernard rieux is the narrator of the novel but reveals himself only revealed at the end tarrou describes him as about 35 of moderate height dark skinned with close cropped black hair at the beginning of the novel rieuxs wife who has been ill for a year leaves for a sanatorium it is rieux who treats the first victim of plague and first uses the word plague to describe the disease he urges the authorities to take action to stop the spread of the epidemic however at first along with everyone else the danger the town faces seems unreal to him he feels uneasy but does not realise the gravity of the situation within a short while he grasps what is at stake and warns the authorities that unless steps are taken immediately the epidemic could kill off half the towns population of two hundred thousand within a couple of monthsbrduring the epidemic rieux heads an auxiliary hospital and works long hours treating the victims he injects serum and lances the abscesses but there is little more that he can do and his duties weigh heavily upon him he never gets home until late and he has to distance himself from the natural pity that he feels for the victims otherwise he would not be able to go on it is especially hard for him when he visits a victim in the persons home because he knows that he must immediately call for an ambulance and have the person removed from the house often the relatives plead with him not to do so since they know they may never see the person againbrrieux works to combat the plague simply because he is a doctor and his job is to relieve human suffering he does not do it for any grand religious purpose like paneloux rieux does not believe in god or as part of a high minded moral code like tarrou he is a practical man doing what needs to be done without any fuss but he knows that the struggle against death is something that he can never win
mme rieux mme rieux is dr rieuxs mother who comes to stay with him when his sick wife goes to the sanatorium she is a serene woman who after taking care of the housework sits quietly in a chair she says that at her age there is nothing much left to fear
jean tarrou jean tarrou arrived in oran some weeks before the plague broke out for unknown reasons he is not there on business since he appears to have private means tarrou is a good natured man who smiles a lot before the plague came he liked to associate with the spanish dancers and musicians in the city he also keeps a diary full of his observations of life in oran which rieux incorporates into the narrativebrit is tarrou who first comes up with the idea of organising teams of volunteers to fight the plague he wants to do so before the authorities begin to conscript people and he does not like the official plan to get prisoners to do the work he takes action prompted by his own code of morals he feels that the plague is everybodys responsibility and that everyone should do his or her duty what interests him he tells rieux is how to become a saint even though he does not believe in godbrlater in the novel tarrou tells rieux with whom he has become friends the story of his life his father although a kind man in private was also an aggressive prosecuting attorney who tried death penalty cases arguing strongly for the death penalty to be imposed as a young boy tarrou attended one day of a criminal proceeding in which a man was on trial for his life however the idea of capital punishment disgusted him after he left home before 18 his main interest in life was his opposition to the death penalty which he regarded as state sponsored murder however years of activism and fighting for the  side of the  have left him disillusionedbrwhen the plague epidemic is virtually over tarrou becomes one of its last victims but puts up a heroic struggle before dying
 is the search for a meaning to life without being unable to find one it is similar to nihilism in which one assumes there is no meaning to life
the theme of exile and separation is embodied in two characters rieux and rambert both of whom are separated from the women they love the theme is also present in the many other nameless citizens who are separated from loved ones in other towns or from those who happened to be out of town when the gates of oran were closed in another sense the entire town feels in exile since it is completely cut off from the outside world rieux as the narrator describes what exile meant to them all
some like rambert are exiles in double measure since they are cut off from those with whom they want to be and do not have the luxury of being in their own homes
the feeling of exile produces many changes in attitudes and behaviours at first people indulge in fantasies imagining the missing persons return but then they start to feel like prisoners drifting through life with nothing left but the past since they do not know how long into the future their ordeal may last the past smacks only of regret of things left undone living with the sense of abandonment they find that they cannot communicate their private grief to their neighbors and conversations tend to be superficial
rieux returns to the theme at the end of the novel after the epidemic is over when the depth of the feelings of exile and deprivation is clear from the overwhelming joy with which long parted lovers and family members greet each other
for some citizens exile was a feeling more difficult to pin down they simply desired a reunion with something that could hardly be named but seemed to them to be the most desirable thing on earth some called it peace rieux numbers tarrou among such people although he found it only in death
this understanding of exile suggests the deeper metaphysical implications of the term it relates to the loss of the belief that humans live in a rational universe in which they can fulfill their hopes and desires find meaning and be at home as camus put it in the myth of sisyphus in a universe that is suddenly deprived of illusions and of light man feels a stranger his is an irremediable exile
the ravages of the plague in oran vividly convey the absurdist position that humans live in an indifferent incomprehensible universe that has no rational meaning or order and no transcendent god the plague comes unannounced and may strike down anyone at any time it is arbitrary and capricious and it leaves humans in a state of fear and uncertainty which ends only in death in the face of this metaphysical reality what must be the response of individuals should they resign themselves to it accept it as inevitable and seek what solace they can as individuals or should they join with others and fight back even though they must live with the certainty that they cannot win camuss answer is clearly the latter embodied in the characters of rieux rambert and tarrou rieuxs position is made clear in part ii in a conversation with tarrou rieux argues that one would have to be a madman to submit willingly to the plague rather than accepting the natural order of things the presence of sickness and death he believes one must fight against them he is aware of the needs of the community he does not live for himself alone when tarrou points out that his victories will never be lasting rieux admits that he is involved in a never ending defeat but it does not stop him from engaging in the struggle
rieux is also aware that working for the common good demands sacrifice he cannot expect personal happiness this is a lesson that rambert learns at first he insists that he does not belong in oran and his only thought is returning to the woman he loves in paris he thinks only of his own personal happiness and the unfairness of the situation in which he has been placed but gradually comes to recognize his membership in a larger human community which makes demands on him that he cannot ignore ultimately he realises he cannot face his lover if he is a coward
tarrou lives according to an ethical code that demands that he act in a way that benefits the whole community even though he risks his life by doing so later in the novel when tarrou tells rieux the story of his life he adds a new dimension to the term plague he views it not just as a specific disease or simply as the presence of an impersonal evil external to humans for tarrou plague is the destructive impulse within every person the will and the capacity to do harm and it is everyones duty to be on guard against this tendency within themselves lest they infect someone else with it he describes his views to rieux
in times of calamity people often turn to religion and camus examines it in the novel in contrast to the humanist beliefs of rieux rambert and tarrou the religious perspective is given in the sermons of the stern jesuit priest father paneloux while the other main characters believe there is no rational explanation for the outbreak of plague paneloux believes there is in his first sermon given during the first month of the plague paneloux describes the epidemic as the flail of god through which god separates the wheat from the chaff the good from the evil paneloux is at pains to emphasize that god did not will the calamity he looked on the evil doing in the town with compassion only when there was no other remedy did he turn his face away in order to force people to face the truth about their life in panelouxs view even the terrible suffering caused by the plague works ultimately for good the divine light can still be seen even in the most catastrophic events and a christian hope is granted to all
panelouxs argument is based on the theology of  on which he is an expert and it is accepted as irutable by many of the townspeople including the magistrate othon it does not satisfy rieux camus caully manipulates the plot to bring up the question of innocent suffering paneloux may argue that the plague is a punishment for sin but how does he reconcile that doctrine with the death of a child the child in question is philippe othon and paneloux along with rieux and tarrou witnesses his horrible death paneloux is moved with compassion for the child and he takes up the question of innocent suffering in his second sermon he argues that because a childs suffering is so horrible and cannot easily be explained it forces people into a crucial test of faith either we must believe everything or we must deny everything and who paneloux asks could bear to do the latter we must yield to the divine will he says we cannot pick and choose and accept only what we can understand however we must still seek to do what good lies in our power as paneloux himself does as one of the volunteers who fights the plague
the second sermon given by paneloux however suggests that his faith has been shaken unable to reconcile his beliefs with the death of the child paneloux becomes sick and uses to be treated his illness is not consistent with the symptoms of the plague and the inexplicable nature of the illness leads rieux to diagnose him as a doubtful case he leaves his fate in the hands of god and he dies clinging to his cross and the remnants of his beliefs the implication is that panelouxs loss of faith is what leads to his death
panelouxs death is in contrast to tarrous who fights valiantly against death when his turn comes the fight tarrou puts up against his end is emblematic of the fight against the plague and the absurdity of the universe the criticism of paneloux is that he unlike tarrou has lost his faith in humanity he chooses instead to cling to a hollow ideal he no longer believes and his death in contrast to tarrous does not bring him peace
it is clear that camuss sympathy in this contrast of ideas lies with rieux and tarrou
this story is told through the character rieux however rieux does not function as a first person narrator rather he disguises himself erring to himself in the third person and does not reveal who he is until at the end of the novel the novel thus appears to be told by an unnamed narrator who gathers information from what he has personally seen and heard regarding the epidemic as well as from the diary of another character tarrou who makes observations about the events he witnesses
the reason that rieux does not declare himself earlier is that he wants to give an objective account of the events in oran he deliberately adopts the tone of an impartial observer rieux is like a witness who exercises restraint when he is called to testify about a crime he describes what the characters said and did without speculating about their thoughts and feelings although he offers generalised assessments of the shifting mood of the town as a whole rieux ers to his story as a chronicle and sees himself as a historian which justifies his decision to stick to the facts and avoid subjectivity this also explains why the style of the plague often gives the impression of distance and detachment only rarely is the reader drawn directly into the emotions of the characters or the drama of the scene
an allegory is a narrative with two distinct levels of meaning the first is the literal level the second signifies a related set of concepts and events the plague is in part a historical allegory in which the plague signifies the german occupation of france from 1940 to 1944 during gray 2007165 
there are many aspects of the narrative that make the allegory plain the town oran which gets afflicted by pestilence and cut off from the outside world is the equivalent of france  camus draws from his own experience of isolation during the war in writing the plaguegray 2007167  the citizens are slow to realiserealise the magnitude of the danger because they do not believe in pestilence or that it could happen to them just as the french were complacent at the beginning of the war they could not imagine that the germans whom they had defeated only twenty years previously could defeat them in a mere six weeks which happened when france fell in june 1940
the different attitudes of the characters lect different attitudes in the french population during the occupation some were the equivalent of paneloux and thought that france was to blame for the calamity that had befallen it they believed that the only solution was to submit gracefully to a historical inevitability the longtterm dominance of europe by germany many people however became members of the  and they are the allegorical equivalents of the voluntary sanitary teams in the novel such as tarrou rambert and grand who fight back against the unspeakable evil the german occupiers
some french collaborated with the germans in the novel they are represented by cottard who welcomes the plague and uses the economic deprivation that results from it to make a fortune buying and selling on the 
other details in the novel can be read at the allegorical level the plague that carries people off unexpectedly echoes the reality of the occupation in which people could be snatched from their homes by the  and imprisoned or sent to work as slave labour in german controlled territories or simply killed the facts of daily life in the plague stricken city resemble life in wartime france the showing of reruns at the cinemas the stockpiling of scarce goods nighttime curfews and isolation camps these paralleling the german internment camps the scenes at the end of the novel when orans gates are reopened recall the jubilant scenes in paris when the city was liberated in 1944
in some places camus makes the allegory explicit as when he ers to the plague in terms that describe an enemy in war the epidemic was in retreat all along the line victory was won and the enemy was abandoning his positions
imagery of the sea is often used in camuss works to suggest life vigour and freedom in the plague a key description of oran occurs early when it is explained that the town is built in such a way that it turns its back on the bay with the result that its impossible to see the sea you always have to go to look for it symbolically oran turns its back on life when the plague hits the deprivation of this symbol of freedom becomes more pronounced as the beaches are closed as is the port in summer the inhabitants lose touch with the sea altogether for all its nearness the sea was out of bounds young limbs had no longer the run of its delights
a significant episode occurs near the end of part iv when tarrou and rieux sit on the terrace of a house from which they can see far into the horizon as he gazes seaward tarrou says with a sense of relief that it is good to be there to set a seal on the friendship between the two men they go for a swim together this contact with the ocean is presented as a moment of renewal harmony and peace it is one of the few lyrical episodes in the novel as they saw the sea spread out before them a gently heaving expanse of deep piled velvet supple and sleek as a creature of the wild
just before rieux enters the water he is possessed by a strange happiness a feeling that is shared by tarrou there is a peaceful image of rieux lying motionless on his back gazing up at the stars and moon and he joins him they swim side by side with the same zest the same rhythm isolated from the world at last free of the town and of the plague

applied ethics is the philosophical examination from a moral standpoint of particular issues in private and public life that are matters of moral judgment it is thus the attempts to use philosophical methods to identify the morally correct course of action in various fields of human life  for example is concerned with identifying the correct approach to matters such as  or the allocation of scarce health resources or the use of human embryos in research  is concerned with questions such as the duties or  duty of whistleblowers to the general public as opposed to their loyalty to their employers as such it is an area of professional philosophy that is relatively well paid and highly valued both within and outside of academiabrenda almond applied ethics in mautner thomas dictionary of philosophy penguin 1996 
applied ethics is distinguished from  which concerns what people should believe to be right and wrong and from  which concerns the nature of moral statements
an emerging typology for applied ethics porter 2006 uses six domains to help improve organizations and social issues at the national and global level
  or ethical theories and ethical decision processes
  or ethics to improve professionalism
  or ethics to improve our basic health needs
  or individual based morals to improve ethics in a business environment
  or ethics among organizations
  or ethics among nations and as one global unit
much of applied ethics is concerned with just three theories
#  where the practical consequences of various policies are evaluated on the assumption that the right policy will be the one which results in the greatest happiness this theories main developments came from  and  who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality later developments have also adjusted the theory most notably  who introduced the idea of  or  in morality and  who introduced the idea of  in to moral decision making 
#  notions based on rules ie that there is an obligation to perform the right action regardless of actual consequences epitomized by s notion of the  which was the centre to kants ethical theory based on  another key deontological theory is  which was heavily developed by  and is the basis of the  
#  derived from aristotles and confuciuss notions which asserts that the right action will be that chosen by a suitably virtuous agent
one modern approach which attempts to overcome the seemingly impossible divide between deontology and utilitarianism of which the divide is caused by the opposite takings of an  and  moral view is  also known as   casuistry does not begin with theory rather it starts with the immediate facts of a real and concrete case  while casuistry makes use of ethical theory it does not view ethical theory as the most important feature of moral reasoning  casuists like albert jonsen and  the abuse of casuistry 1988 challenge the traditional  of applied ethics  instead of starting from theory and applying theory to a particular case casuists start with the particular case itself and then ask what morally significant features including both theory and practical considerations ought to be considered for that particular case  in their observations of medical ethics committees jonsen and toulmin note that a consensus on particularly problematic moral cases often emerges when participants focus on the facts of the case rather than on  or   thus a rabbi a catholic priest and an agnostic might agree that in this particular case the best approach is to withhold extraordinary medical care while disagreeing on the reasons that support their individual positions  by focusing on cases and not on theory those engaged in moral debate increase the possibility of agreement

in  the absolute value or modulus  of a ampnbsp is the  value ofampnbsp without regard to its  namely  for a ampnbsp  for a ampnbsp in which case  is positive and  for example the absolute value of 3 is 3 and the absolute value of −3 is also 3 the absolute value of a number may be thought of as its  from zero
generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings for example an absolute value is also defined for the s the s s  and s the absolute value is closely related to the notions of   and  in various mathematical and physical contexts
in 1806  introduced the term module meaning unit of measure in french specifically for the complex absolute value name oed draft revision june 2008 http  wwwamazoncom gp reader 0691027951 nahin http  www historymcsst andrewsacuk mathematicians argandhtml oconnor and robertson and http  functionswolframcom complexcomponents abs 35  functionswolframcom for the french sense see  1877  and it was borrowed into english in 1866 as the latin equivalent modulus name oed   the term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in french mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans lespace pampnbsp105 http  booksgooglecom booksid yyioaaaaqaajamppg pa105 at google books  and 1857 in englishjames mill peirce a text book of analytic geometry http  booksgooglecom booksid rjalaaaayaajamppg pa42 at google books  the oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the oxford english dictionary is from 1907 the term absolute value is also used in contrast to relative value  the notation  with a  on each side was introduced by  in 1841nicholas j higham handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences siam isbn 0 89871 420 6 pampnbsp25  other names for absolute value include numerical value name oed   and magnitude name oed  
the same notation is used with sets to denote  the meaning depends on context
for any ampnbsp the absolute value or modulus ofampnbsp is denoted by  a  on each side of the quantity and is defined asmendelson http  booksgooglecom booksid a8ham38zscmcamppg pa2 pampnbsp2 
math x    \begin{cases} x amp \mbox{if }  x \ge 0  \\  x  amp \mbox{if } x  0 \end{cases}  math
as can be seen from the above definition the absolute value ofampnbsp is always either  or  but never 
from an  point of view the absolute value of a real number is that numbers  from zero along the  and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them indeed the notion of an abstract  in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference see  below
since the  notation without sign represents the positive square root it follows that
{ 
  
  style width 250px   math a    \sqrt{a^2} math
  
 }
which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value of real numbers pampnbspa5 
the absolute value has the following four fundamental properties
{ 
  
  style width 250px  math a  \ge 0  math

  non negativity
  
 math a    0 \iff a   0  math

other important properties of the absolute value include

two other useful properties concerning inequalities are
math a  \le b \iff  b \le a \le b  math
math a  \ge b \iff a \le  b\  math or mathb \le a  math
these relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values for example
{ 
  
 math x 3  \le 9  math
 math\iff  9 \le x 3 \le 9  math
  
 
 math\iff  6 \le x \le 12  math
 }
absolute value is used to define the  the standard metric on the real numbers
since the s are not  the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalised for a complex number however the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalised the absolute value of a complex number is defined as its distance in the  from the  using the  more generally the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers
for any complex number
mathz   x + iy math
where  and  are real numbers the absolute value or modulus ofampnbsp is denoted  and is given by 
math z     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} math
when the imaginary part  is zero this is the same as the absolute value of the real numberampnbsp
when a complex numberampnbsp is expressed in  as
mathz   r e^{i \theta} math
with  and θ real its absolute value is
math z    r math
the absolute value of a complex number can be written in the complex analogue of equationampnbsp above as
math z    \sqrt{z \cdot \overline{z}} math
where  is the  ofampnbsp
notice that contrary to equationampnbsp
math z  \neq \sqrt{z^2} math
 
the complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in equationsampnbsp above
since the  form a  of the complex numbers under multiplication we may think of absolute value as an  of the  of the complex numbers 
the real absolute value function is  everywhere it is  everywhere except for ampnbsp ampnbsp0  it is  on the interval  and monotonically increasing on the interval  since a real number and its  have the same absolute value it is an  and is hence not 
both the real and complex functions are 
it is a  
the absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign whereas the  returns a numbers sign irrespective of its value the following equations show the relationship between these two functions

or
math  x  \sgnx   x math
and for 
math\sgnx   \frac{ x }{x} math

the  absolute value function is continuous everywhere but  nowhere because it violates the  name mathworld 
the second derivative ofampnbsp with respect toampnbsp is zero everywhere except zero where it does not exist as a  the second derivative may be taken as two times the 
the  indefinite integral of the absolute value function is

the absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance as noted above the absolute value of a real or complex number is the  from that number to the origin along the real number line for real numbers or in the complex plane for complex numbers and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them
the standard  between two points

while if
math a   a_1 + i a_2  math
and

are complex numbers then

 math   \sqrt{a_1   b_1^2 + a_2   b_2^2} math
 }
the above shows that the absolute value distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers agrees with the standard euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two dimensional euclidean spaces respectively
the properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers non negativity identity of indiscernibles symmetry and the triangle inequality given above can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a  as follows
a real valued function  on a set  is called a  or a distance function onampnbsp if it satisfies the following four axiomsthese axioms are not minimal for instance non negativity can be derived from the other three  
{

 non negativity
  
 mathda b   0 \iff a   b  math
 identity of indiscernibles
  
 mathda b   db a  math
 symmetry
  
 mathda b  \le da c + dc b   math
 triangle inequality
 }
the definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any  that is ifampnbsp is an element of an ordered ringampnbspr then the absolute value ofampnbsp denoted by  is defined to bemac lane http  booksgooglecom booksid l6fend8ghiucamppg pa264 pampnbsp264 
math a    \begin{cases} a amp \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\  a  amp \mbox{if } a \le 0 \end{cases} \  math
where  is the  ofampnbsp and 0 is the additive 
the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in –5 above can be used to generalise the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field as follows
a real valued functionampnbsp on a ampnbsp is called an absolute value also a modulus magnitude value or valuationshechter http  booksgooglecom booksid equv3bcd56ecamppg pa260 pampnbsp260 this meaning of valuation is rare usually a  is the logarithm of the inverse of an absolute value  if it satisfies the following four axioms

where 0 denotes the  element ofampnbsp it follows from positive definiteness and multiplicativeness that  where 1 denotes the  element ofampnbsp the real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field
if  is an absolute value onampnbsp then the functionampnbsp on  defined by  is a metric and the following are equivalent

an absolute value which satisfies any hence all of the above conditions is said to be non archimedean otherwise it is said to be shechter http  booksgooglecom booksid equv3bcd56ecamppg pa260 ppampnbsp260–261 
again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used with a slight modification to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space
a real valued function on a ampnbsp over a fieldampnbsp represented as big big is called an absolute value but more usually a  if it satisfies the following axioms
for allampnbsp inampnbsp and   inampnbsp

the norm of a vector is also called its length or magnitude
in the case of ampnbsp the function defined by

an analog  or  analogue signal  is any   for which the time varying feature variable of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity ie analogous to another time varying signal   for example in an analog  the instantaneous  of the signal varies continuously with the  of the sound waves it differs from a  in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of  which can only take on one of a finite number of valueshttps  wwwst andrewsacuk ~www_pa scots_guide info signals digital digitalhtm https  learnsparkfuncom tutorials analog vs digital digital signals   the term analog signal usually ers to s however    human speech and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals
an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signals information for example an  uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information  in an electrical signal the   or  of the signal may be varied to represent the information
any information may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena such as    position or   the physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a    for example in sound recording fluctuations in air pressure that is to say  strike the diaphragm of a  which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone or the voltage produced by a condensor microphone  the voltage or the current is said to be an analog of the sound
an analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution  in practice an analog signal is subject to  and  introduced by s and  operations which can progressively degrade the   in contrast digital signals have a finite resolution  converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a constant low level noise called  into the signal which determines the noise floor but once in digital form the signal can in general be processed or transmitted without introducing additional noise or distortion  theore as analog signal processing systems become more complex they may ultimately degrade signal resolution to such an extent that their performance is surpassed by digital systems  this explains the widespread use of digital signals in perence to analog in modern technology  in analog systems it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs  however in digital systems degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well
the primary disadvantage of analog signals is that any system has  – ie random unwanted variation as the signal is copied and re copied or transmitted over long distances or electronically processed the unavoidable noise introduced by each step in the signal path is additive progressively degrading the  until in extreme cases the signal can be overwhelmed  this is called   noise can show up as hiss and  in audio signals or snow in video signals    this degradation is impossible to recover since there is no sure way to distinguish the noise from the signal amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise distortion interference as well digital signals can be transmitted stored and processed without introducing noise even if the resolution of an analog signal is higher than a comparable digital signal after enough processing the analog signal to noise ratio will be lower
however unlimited processing capacity to ine a digital signal and the resources required should not be taken for granted in other words processing capacity available for a digital signal is itself an analog signal   it lects non discrete factors in the real world such as quantity and quality of computers connections between them sufficient electric power shutdowns hacker attacks running costs and everything else that can affect performance and availability in comparison analog signals are normally affected by a limited range of factors whose degrading effect is for the most part already represented by the noise so while an aircrafts altimeter may be thrown off if the plane suddenly enters an air zone with different pressure an emergency scenario it will give correct altitude most of the time subtle pressure changes are already covered by the small random vacillations noise an altimeter can be configured to ignore   in the simplest case the trembling of the gauge arrow because a digital signal by definition does not vary with  another continuous quantity that could be compensated for all digital interference that does occur is to some extent unpredictable electrically analog noise can be diminished by shielding good connections and several cable types such as  or 
another method of conveying an analog signal is to use  in this some base signal eg a   has one of its properties modulated  involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage  by the source information  changes the  other techniques such as changing the  of the base signal also work
s do not involve  of information into digital format the concept being measured over the circuit whether sound light pressure temperature or an exceeded limit remains from end to end

hercule poirot   is a fictional  detective created by  poirot is one of christies most famous and long lived characters appearing in 33 novels one play  and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975
poirot has been portrayed on radio on screen for films and television by various actors including        and most notably 
poirots name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time  hercule popeau and frank howel evans monsieur poiret a retired belgian police officer living in london 
a more obvious influence on the early poirot stories is that of  in an autobiography christie states i was still writing in the  tradition – eccentric detective stooge assistant with a  type scotland yard detective inspector jappreproduced as the introduction to   for his part conan doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of s  and his anonymous narrator and basing his character sherlock holmes on  who in his use of  pigured poirots reliance on his little grey cells
poirot also bears a striking resemblance to s fictional detective  of the french  who first appeared in the 1910 novel  and predates the first poirot novel by ten years
unlike the models mentioned above christies poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book written in 1916 and published in 1920 his belgian nationality was interesting because of belgiums occupation by germany which also provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be out of work and available to solve mysteries at an  at the time of christies writing it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the belgians  since the invasion of their country had constituted britains  for entering world war i and british wartime propaganda emphasised the 
poirot first appeared in  published in 1920 and exited in  published in 1975 following the latter poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of   
by 1930 agatha christie found poirot insufferable and by 1960 she felt that he was a detestable bombastic tiresome ego centric little creep yet the public loved him and christie used to kill him off claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked 
 first description of poirot
blockquotehe was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity his head was exactly the shape of an egg and he always perched it a little on one side his moustache was very stiff and military even if everything on his face was covered the tips of moustache and the pink tipped nose would be visible blockquote
blockquotethe neatness of his attire was almost incredible i believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound yet this quaint dandified little man who i was sorry to see now limped badly had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the belgian police blockquote
agatha christies initial description of poirot in the murder on the orient express
blockquoteby the step leading up into the sleeping car stood a young french lieutenant resplendent in uniform conversing with a small man hercule poirot muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink tipped nose and the two points of an upward curled moustache blockquote
in the later books his limp is not mentioned suggesting it may have been a temporary wartime injury poirot has green eyes that are repeatedly described as shining like a cats when he is struck by a clever ideaeg for about ten minutes poirot sat in dead silence  and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener   and dark hair which he dyes later in lifeas hastings discovers in   however many of his screen incarnations are portrayed as bald or balding
frequent mention is made of his  shoes damage to which is frequently a source of misery for him but comical for the readereg hercule poirot looked down at the tips of his patent leather shoes and sighed   poirots appearance regarded as fastidious during his early career later falls hopelessly out of fashioneg and now here was the man himself really a most impossible person – the wrong clothes – button boots an incredible moustache not his – meredith blakes kind of fellow at all   he employs  reading glasses
among poirots most significant personal attributes is the sensitivity of his stomach
blockquotethe plane dropped slightly mon estomac thought hercule poirot and closed his eyes determinedly blockquote
he suffers from sea sicknessmy stomach it is not happy on the sea  and in death in the clouds he states that his air sickness prevents him from being more alert at the time of the murder later in his life we are told
blockquotealways a man who had taken his stomach seriously he was reaping his reward in old age eating was not only a physical pleasure it was also an intellectual research blockquote
poirot is extremely punctual and carries a  almost to the end of his careerhe walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the bell glancing as he did so at the neat wrist watch which had at last replaced an old favourite – the large turnip faced watch of early days yes it was exactly nine thirty as ever hercule poirot was exact to the minute   he is also pernickety about his personal finances perring to keep a bank balance of 444ampnbsppounds 4 shillings and 4 pence
as mentioned in  and  he is fond of classical music particularly  and 
in the mysterious affair at styles poirot operates as a fairly conventional clue based and logical detective lected in his vocabulary by two common phrases his use of  and order and method hastings is irritated by the fact that poirot sometimes conceals important details of his plans as in the big four in this novel hastings is kept in the dark throughout the climax this aspect of poirot is less evident in the later novels partly because there is rarely a narrator to mislead
in murder on the links still largely dependent on clues himself poirot mocks a rival bloodhound detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues established in detective fiction eg sherlock holmes depending on  s and cigar ash from this point on poirot establishes his psychological bona fides rather than painstakingly examining crime scenes he inquires into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer he predicates his actions in the later novels on his underlying assumption that particular crimes are committed by particular types of people
poirot focuses on getting people to talk in the early novels he casts himself in the role of papa poirot a benign confessor especially to young women in later works christie made a point of having poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining informationit has been said of hercule poirot by some of his friends and associates at moments when he has maddened them most that he pers lies to truth and will go out of his way to gain his ends by elaborate false statements rather than trust to the simple truth   in the murder of roger ackroyd poirot speaks of a non existent mentally disabled nepheweg after a caul study of the goods displayed in the window poirot entered and represented himself as desirous of purchasing a rucksack for a hypothetical nephew hickory dickory dock chapter 13  to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit in dumb witness poirot invents an elderly invalid mother as a pretense to investigate local nurses in the big four poirot pretends to have and poses as a younger brother named achille however this brother was mentioned again in the labours of hercules poirot claimed to have a brother for a short time
blockquoteto this day harold is not quite sure what made him suddenly pour out the whole story to a little man to whom he had only spoken a few minutes before blockquote
poirot is also willing to appear more foreign or vain in an effort to make people underestimate him he admits as much
blockquoteit is true that i can speak the exact the idiomatic english but my friend to speak the broken english is an enormous asset it leads people to despise you they say – a foreigner – he cant even speak english properly  also i boast an englishman he says often a fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much  and so you see i put people off their guard blockquote
in later novels christie often uses the word mountebank when characters describe poirot showing that he has successfully passed himself off as a  or fraud
poirots investigating techniques assist him solving cases for in the long run either through a lie or through truth people were bound to give themselves away at the end poirot usually reveals his description of the sequence of events and his deductions to a room of suspects often leading to the culprits apprehension
i suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about poirots family by this timedr sheppard  
a brief passage in the big four provides original information about poirots birth or at least childhood in or near the town of  or in the village of  province of hainaut belgium – a few memorials dedicated to hercule poirot can be seen in the center of this village but we did not go into spa itself we left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills till we reached a little hamlet and an isolated white villa high on the hillside christie strongly implies that this quiet retreat in the  near spa is the location of the poirot family home christie is purposefully vague as poirot is thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels and in an autobiography she admitted that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920 at the time however she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come in the ellezelles birth memorial attesting poirots birth his father and mother were named jules louis poirot and godelieve poirot
christie wrote that poirot is a roman catholic by birthhercule poirot was a catholic by birth   not much is described about his later religious convictions if any except sporadic erences to his going to churchin  book ii chapter 6 poirot goes into church to pray and happens across a suspect with whom he briefly discusses ideas of sin and confession   christie provides little information regarding poirot’s childhood only mentioning in three act tragedy that he comes from a large family with little wealth and has at least one younger sister
blockquotegustave  was not a policeman i have dealt with policemen all my life and i know he could pass as a detective to an outsider but not to a man who was a policeman himself
 — hercule poirot  blockquote
hercule poirot was active in the  police force by 1893 very little mention is made about this part of his life but in the nemean lion 1939 poirot ers to a belgian case of his in which a wealthy soap manufacturer  poisoned his wife in order to be free to marry his secretary as poirot was often misleading about his past to gain information the truthfulness of that statement is unknown
inspector japp offers some insight into poirots career with the belgian police when introducing him to a colleague
blockquoteyouve heard me speak of mr poirot it was in 1904 he and i worked together – the abercrombie forgery case – you remember he was run down in brussels ah those were the days moosier then do you remember baron altara there was a pretty rogue for you he eluded the clutches of half the police in europe but we nailed him in antwerp – thanks to mr poirot here blockquote
in the short story  1923 poirot reveals to  an account of what he considers to be his only failure poirot admits that he has failed to solve a crime innumerable times
blockquotei have been called in too late very often another working towards the same goal has arrived there first twice i have been struck down with illness just as i was on the point of success blockquote
nevertheless he regards the 1893 case in the chocolate boxthe date is given in   as his only actual failure of detection again poirot is not reliable as a narrator of his personal history and there is no evidence that christie sketched it out in any depth during his police career poirot shot a man who was firing from a roof into the public below in  poirot reveals that he learned to read writing upside down during his police career around that time he met xavier bouc director of the  poirot also became a uniformed director working on trains
in the double clue poirot mentions that he was chief of police of brussels until the great war wwi forced him to leave for england
blockquotei had called in at my friend poirots rooms to find him sadly overworked so much had he become the rage that every rich woman who had mislaid a bracelet or lost a pet kitten rushed to secure the services of the great hercule poirot blockquote
during world war i poirot left belgium for england as a  although he returned a few times on 16 july 1916 he again met his lifelong friend captain arthur hastings and solved the first of his cases to be published the mysterious affair at styles it is clear that hastings and poirot are already friends when they meet in chapter 2 of the novel as hastings tells cynthia that he has not seen him for some years particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that hastings had met poirot in belgium are given in curtain poirots last case chapter 1 someone had been shot in a village where hastings was duck shooting and poirot had been called in from the brussels police to investigate after that case poirot apparently came to the attention of the british secret service and undertook cases for the british government including foiling the attempted abduction of the recounted in   readers were told that the british authorities had learned of poirots keen investigative ability from certain 
after the war poirot became a private detective and began undertaking civilian cases he moved into what became both his home and work address flat 203 at 56b whitehaven mansions hastings first visits the flat when he returns to england in june 1935 from argentina in  chapter 1 the tv programmes place this in  charterhouse square in the wrong part of london  according to hastings it was chosen by poirot entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion and described as the newest type of service flat the florin court building was actually built in 1936 decades after poirot fictionally moved in his first case in this period was the affair at the victory ball which allowed poirot to enter high society and begin his career as a private detective
between the world wars poirot travelled all over europe africa asia and half of south america investigating crimes and solving murders most of his cases occurred during this time and he was at the height of his powers at this point in his life in the murder on the links the belgian pits his grey cells against a french murderer in the middle east he solved the cases death on the nile and murder in mesopotamia with ease and even survived an appointment with death as he passed through eastern europe on his return trip he solved the murder on the orient express however he did not travel to north america the west indies the caribbean or oceania probably due to sea sickness
blockquoteit is this villainous sea that troubles me the mal de mer – it is horrible sufferingpoirot in   blockquote
it was during this time he met the countess vera rossakoff a glamorous jewel thief the history of the countess is like poirots steeped in mystery she claims to have been a member of the russian aristocracy before the russian rebellion and suffered greatly as a result but how much of that story is true is an open question even poirot acknowledges that rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justicecassatis john 1979 the diaries of a christie london 
blockquoteit is the misfortune of small precise men always to hanker after large and flamboyant women poirot had never been able to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the countess held for himthe capture of cerebus 1947 the first sentence quoted is also a close paraphrase of something said to poirot by hastings in chapter 18 of the big four  blockquote
although letting the countess escape was morally questionable it was not uncommon in the nemean lion poirot sided with the criminal miss amy carnaby allowing her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client sir joseph hoggins who poirot discovered had plans to commit murder poirot even sent miss carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign in the murder of roger ackroyd poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare the feelings of the murderers relatives in the augean stables he helped the government to cover up vast corruption in murder on the orient express poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in ratchetts murder there was no question of his guilt but he had been acquitted in america over a technicality considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted ratchett and twelve people had stabbed him poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death
after his cases in the middle east poirot returned to britain apart from some of the so called labours of hercules see next section he very rarely went abroad during his later career he moved into styles court towards the end of his life
while poirot was usually paid handsomely by clients he was also known to take on cases that piqued his curiosity although they did not pay well
poirot shows a love of steam trains which christie contrasts with hastings love of autos this is shown in   murder on the orient express and the abc murders in the tv series steam trains are seen in nearly all of the episodes
blockquotethat’s the way of it just a case or two just one case more – the prima donna’s farewell performance won’t be in it with yours poirot dr burton in the pace  blockquote
confusion surrounds poirots retirement most of the cases covered by poirots private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow  at which time he solves the murder of roger ackroyd it has been said that the twelve cases related in the labours of hercules 1947 must er to a different retirement but the fact that poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before roger ackroyd and presumably poirot closed his agency once he had completed them there is specific mention in the capture of cerberus of the twenty year gap between poirots previous meeting with countess rossakoff and this one if the labours precede the events in roger ackroyd then the ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years later than it was published and so must any of the cases that er to it one alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once poirot is determined to have another go but this is specifically denied by poirot himself in response to the suggestion that he might take up gardening in his retirement poirot answers once the vegetable marrows yes – but never again  also in the erymanthian boar a character is said to have been turned out of austria by the  implying that the events of  took place after 1937 another alternative would be to suggest that the pace to the labours takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years none of the explanations is especially attractive
in terms of a rudimentary chronology poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in chapter 18 of the big four 1927 which places that novel out of published order before roger ackroyd he declines to solve a case for the home secretary because he is retired in chapter one of peril at end house 1932 he is certainly retired at the time of three act tragedy 1935 but he does not enjoy his retirement and repeatedly takes cases thereafter when his curiosity is engaged he continues to employ his secretary miss lemon at the time of the cases retold in hickory dickory dock and dead mans folly which take place in the mid 1950s it is theore better to assume that christie provided no authoritative chronology for poirots retirement but assumed that he could either be an active detective a consulting detective or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required
one consistent element about poirots retirement is that his fame declines during it so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters especially younger characters recognise neither him nor his name
blockquotei should perhaps madame tell you a little more about myself i am hercule poirotbr 
the revelation left mrs summerhayes unmovedbr 
what a lovely name she said kindly greek isnt it blockquote
poirot is less active during the cases that take place at the end of his career beginning with three act tragedy 1934 christie had perfected during the inter war years a subgenre of poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events in novels such as taken at the flood  and hickory dickory dock he is even less in evidence frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character in cat among the pigeons poirots entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought whether this was a lection of his age or of christies distaste for him is impossible to assess  1949 and  1957 which could easily have been poirot novels represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works
towards the end of his career it becomes clear that poirots retirement is no longer a convenient fiction  he assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels he even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with  and   in the absence of a more appropriate puzzle he solves such inconsequential domestic riddles as the presence of three pieces of orange peel in his umbrella stand 
poirot and it is reasonable to suppose his creator becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up and coming generations young people in hickory dickory dock he investigates the strange goings on in a student hostel while in third girl 1966 he is forced into contact with the smart set of chelsea youths in the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties he proves himself once again but has become heavily reliant on other investigators especially the  mr goby who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself
notably during this time his physical characteristics also change dramatically and by the time arthur hastings meets poirot again in curtain he looks very different from his previous appearances having become thin with age and with obviously dyed hair
poirot passes away from complications of a heart condition at the end of  he had moved his  pills out of his own reach possibly because of guilt he thereby became the murderer in curtain although it was for the benefit of others poirot himself noted that he wanted to kill his victim shortly before his own death so that he could avoid succumbing to the arrogance of the murderer concerned that he might come to view himself as entitled to kill those whom he deemed necessary to eliminate
the murderer that he was hunting had never actually killed anyone but he had manipulated others to kill for him subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts as nothing more than a momentary passion poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted as he did not legally do anything wrong it is revealed at the end of curtain that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from  to give the impression that he is more infirm than he is his last recorded words are cher ami spoken to hastings as the captain left his room the tv adaptation adds that as poirot is dying alone he whispers out his final prayer to god in these words forgive me forgive name suchet  poirot was buried at styles and his funeral was arranged by his best friend hastings and hastings daughter judith hastings reasoned here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country he was to lie here at the last
poirots actual death and funeral occurred in curtain years after his retirement from active investigation but it was not the first time that hastings attended the funeral of his best friend in the big four 1927 poirot feigned his death and subsequent funeral to launch a surprise attack on the big four
hastings a former british army officer first meets poirot during poirots years as a police officer in belgium and almost immediately after they both arrive in england he becomes poirots lifelong friend and appears in many cases poirot regards hastings as a poor private detective not particularly intelligent yet helpful in his way of being fooled by the criminal or seeing things the way the average man would see them and for his tendency to unknowingly stumble onto the truth  hastings marries and has four children – two sons and two daughters
as a loyal albeit somewhat naïve companion hastings is to poirot what watson is to sherlock holmes
hastings is capable of great bravery and courage facing death unflinchingly when confronted by the big four and displaying unwavering loyalty towards poirot however when forced to choose between poirot and his wife in that novel he initially chooses to betray poirot to protect his wife later though he tells poirot to draw back and escape the trap
the two are an airtight team until hastings meets and marries dulcie duveen a beautiful music hall performer half his age after investigating the murder on the links they later emigrate to argentina leaving poirot behind as a very unhappy old man poirot and hastings reunite for the final time in curtain poirots last case having been earlier reunited in the big four peril at end house the abc murders lord edgware dies and dumb witness when hastings arrives in england for business
detective novelist ariadne oliver is agatha christies humorous self caricature like christie she is not overly fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating–in ariadnes case finnish sleuth  we never learn anything about her husband but we do know that she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of  she also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats her maid maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others
she has authored over 56 novels and greatly dislikes people modifying her characters she is the only one in poirots universe to have noted that it’s not natural for five or six people to be on the spot when b is murdered and all have a motive for killing b she first met poirot in the story cards on the table and has been bothering him ever since
poirots secretary miss felicity lemon has few human weaknesses the only mistakes she makes within the series are a typing error during the events of hickory dickory dock and the mis mailing of an electricity bill although she was worried about strange events surrounding her sister at the time poirot described her as being unbelievably ugly and incredibly efficient anything that she mentioned as worth consideration usually was worth consideration she is an expert on nearly everything and plans to create the perfect filing system she also worked for the government statistician turned philanthropist  whether this was during one of poirot’s numerous retirements or before she entered his employ is unknown in the agatha christie hour she was portrayed by british actress angela easterling while in  she was portrayed by  a marked difference from the text exists in morans portrayal where she is an attractive fashionable and emotional woman showing an occasional soft corner for poirot she also appears far more often in the tv series making an appearance in most episodes and often being a bigger part of the plot on a number of occasions she joins poirot in his inquiries or seeks out answers alone at his request
japp is a  inspector and appears in many of the stories trying to solve cases that poirot is working on japp is outgoing loud and sometimes inconsiderate by nature and his relationship with the ined belgian is one of the stranger aspects of poirot’s world he first met poirot in belgium in 1904 during the abercrombie forgery later that year they joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as baron altara they also meet in england where poirot often helps japp and lets him take credit in return for special favours these favours usually entail poirot being supplied with other interesting casescaptain arthur hastings   in  japp was portrayed by  in the film thirteen at dinner 1985 adapted from lord edgware dies the role of japp was taken by the actor  who would later star as poirot in the itv adaptations
the poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in england from the first book the mysterious affair at styles where he is a ugee staying at styles to the last poirot book curtain where he visits styles before his death in between poirot solves cases outside england as well including his most famous case murder on the orient express 1934
hercule poirot became famous in 1926 with the publication of the murder of roger ackroyd whose surprising solution proved controversial the novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels  alludes to it in the title of his well known attack on detective fiction who cares who killed roger ackroyd aside from roger ackroyd the most critically acclaimed poirot novels appeared from 1932 to 1942 including murder on the orient express the abc murders 1935  1936 and death on the nile 1937 a tale of multiple homicide upon a nile steamer death on the nile was judged by detective novelist  to be among the ten greatest mystery novels of all time
the 1942 novel five little pigs aka murder in retrospect in which poirot investigates a murder committed sixteen years before by analysing various accounts of the tragedy is a  like performance in his analysis of this book critic and mystery novelist  erred to it as the best christie of allbarnard 1980 p 85

jane marple usually erred to as miss marple is a  appearing in 12 of s crime novels and in 20 short stories miss marple is an elderly  who lives in the village of  and acts as an amateur consulting  alongside  she is one of the most loved and famous of christies characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen her first appearance was in a short story published in  in december 1927   which later became the first chapter of  1932 her first appearance in a full length novel was in  in 1930
the character of miss marple is based on christies step grandmother or her aunt margaret west and her croniesmargaret west married agatha christies great grandfather nathaniel frary miller in 1863 in westbourne west sussex he died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in stjohns church main road southbourne west sussex   agatha christie attributed the inspiration for the character of miss marple to a number of sources stating that miss marple was the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmothers ealing cronies – old ladies whom i have met in so many villages where i have gone to stay as a girl  christie also used material from her fictional creation spinster caroline sheppard who appeared in  when  adapted the novel for the stage he replaced the character of caroline with a young girl this change saddened christie and she determined to give old maids a voice miss marple was born name agathachristiecom 
there is no definitive source for the derivation of the name marple name cheshire lifehttp  cheshiregreatbritishlifecouk article was miss marple born in cheshire 4540  was miss marple born in cheshire cheshire life accessed 30 march 2009  the most common explanation is that the name was taken from  in  through which christie passed alternatively christie may have taken the name from a family named marple who lived at marple hall near her sister madges home at abney hall name cheshire life http  wwwpoirotus mprofilephp marples profile hercule poirot central accessed 30 march 2009 
the character of jane marple in the first miss marple book  is markedly different from how she appears in later books this early version of miss marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman the citizens of st mary mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone in later books she becomes more modern and a kinder person
miss marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence and st mary mead over her lifetime has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature crimes always remind her of a parallel incident although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime she also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand in several stories she is able to rely on her acquaintance with  a retired commissioner of the  for official information when required
miss marple never married and has no close living relatives her nephew the well known author raymond west appears in some stories including sleeping murder and ingots of gold which also feature his wife joan a modern artist though prior to their marriage she is erred to as joyce lemprière in the the thirteen problems stories raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunts mental acuity miss marple employs young women clara emily alice esther gwenda and amy from a nearby orphanage whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long time maid housekeeper faithful florence she was briefly looked after by her irritating maid miss knight in her later years companion cherry baker first introduced in the mirror crackd from side to side lives in
miss marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of raymond west her nephew  1964 she is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as genteel indeed a  miss marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of british detective fiction the  she demonstrates a remarkably thorough education including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers in  1952 it is revealed that miss marple grew up in a  and that she studied at an italian finishing school with americans ruth van rydock and caroline carrie louise serrocold
while miss marple is described as an old lady in many of the stories her age is mentioned in at bertrams hotel where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then excluding sleeping murder 41 years passed between the first and last written novels and many characters grow and age an example would be the vicars nephew in the murder at the vicarage the reverend clements nephew dennis is a teenager in the mirror crackd from side to side it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career the effects of ageing are seen on miss marple such as needing a holiday after illness in 
little is known about marples background except that she has two younger sisters one of them is the mother of  and the other is mother to mabel denham a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband geoffrey

rutherford who was 70 years old when the first film was made insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie as well as having her real life husband  appear alongside her as the character mr stringer the rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in germany and in that country miss marple is generally identified with rutherfords quirky portrayal name autogenerated1

according to the  aaron first functioned as  assistant because moses complained that he could not speak well god appointed aaron as moses prophet exodus 410 17 71 at the command of  he let his rod turn into a snake exodus 79 12  then he stretched out his  in order to bring on the first three plagues exodus 719 8112    after that moses tended to act and speak for himself exodus 923 101322   
during the journey in the wilderness aaron was not always prominent or active at the battle with amalek he was chosen with  to support the hand of moses that held the rod of god exodus 179  when the revelation was given to moses at mount sinai he headed the elders of israel who accompanied moses on the way to the summit while  went with moses to the top however aaron and hur remained below to look after the people exodus 249 14
  from here on in exodus leviticus and numbers joshua appears in the role of moses assistant while aaron functions instead as the first high priest
the books of exodus leviticus and numbers maintain that aaron received from god a monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants exodus 281 the family of aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to the god of israel the rest of his tribe the s were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary numbers 3 moses anointed and consecrated aaron and his sons to the priesthood and arrayed them in the robes of office leviticus 8 cf exodus 28 29 he also related to them gods detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the israelites listened leviticus 1 7 11 27 aaron and his successors as high priest were given control over the  by which the will of god could be determined exodus 2830 name olson  god commissioned the aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean and to teach the divine laws the torah to the israelites leviticus 1010 11 the priests were also commissioned to bless the people numbers 622 27   when aaron completed the altar offerings for the first time and with moses blessed the people and the glory of the  appeared unto all the people and there came a fire out from before the  and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces leviticus 923 24  in this way the institution of the aaronide priesthood was established name phod 
in later books of the old testament aaron and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the  and later the books of judges samuel and kings mention priests and levites but do not mention the aaronides in particular the book of  which devotes much attention to priestly matters calls the priestly upper class the  after one of king davids priests name olson  it does lect a two tier priesthood with the levites in subordinate position a two tier hierarchy of aaronides and levites appears in ezra nehemiah and chronicles as a result many historians think that aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre exilic israel what is clear is that high priests claiming aaronide descent dominated the   most scholars think the pentateuch reached its final form early in this period which may account for aarons prominence in exodus leviticus and numbers
aaron plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts over leadership during israels wilderness wanderings during the prolonged absence of moses on mount sinai the people provoked aaron to make a  as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from egypt exodus 321 6  this incident nearly caused god to destroy the israelites for their unfaithfulness to the covenant exodus 3210 moses successfully intervened but then led the loyal levites in executing many of the culprits and a plague afflicted those who were left exodus 3225 35  aaron however escaped punishment for his role in the affair because of the intercession of moses according to deuteronomy 920  later retellings of this story almost always excuse aaron for his role name watts 2011  for example in rabbinic sourcestalmud shabbat 99a exodus rabbah 41  and in the quran aaron was not the idol maker and upon moses return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the israelites quran 7142 152 
on the day of aarons consecration his oldest sons  were burned up by divine fire because they offered strange incense leviticus 101 3  most interpreters think this story lects a conflict between priestly families sometime in israels past others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow gods instructions given through moses name watts 2011 
the pentateuch generally depicts the siblings moses aaron and miriam as the leaders of israel after the exodus a view also lected in the biblical book of micah  numbers 12 however reports that on one occasion aaron and miriam complained about moses  exclusive claim to be the s prophet  their presumption was rebuffed by god who affirmed moses uniqueness as the one with whom the  spoke face to face miriam was punished with skin disease  that turned her skin white aaron pleaded with moses to intercede for her and miriam after seven days quarantine was healed aaron once again escaped any retribution
according to numbers 16 17 a levite named  led many in challenging aarons exclusive claim to the priesthood when the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth numbers 1625 35  eleazar the son of aaron was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests and when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels aaron at the command of moses took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated numbers 171 15 1636 50  
 
to emphasize the validity of the levites claim to the offerings and tithes of the israelites moses collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in israel and laid the twelve rods over night in the tent of meeting the next morning aarons rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds numbers 1723   the following chapter then details the distinction between aarons family and the rest of the levites while all the levites and only levites were devoted to the care of the sanctuary charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the  alone numbers 181 7 
aaron like moses was not permitted to enter canaan with the israelites name jd3  because the two brothers showed impatience at   in the last year of the desert pilgrimage numbers 2012 13  when moses brought water out of a rock to quench the peoples thirst though they had been commanded to speak to the rock moses struck it with the staff twice which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the  numbers 207 11 name jd3  
there are two accounts of the death of aaron in the pentateuch name jd3  numbers says that soon after the incident at meribah aaron with his son eleazar and moses ascended mount hor there moses stripped aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to eleazar aaron died on the summit of the mountain and the people mourned for him thirty days numbers 2022 29 compare 3338 39 name jd3  name bible numbers 2022 29 kjv  name bible numbers 3338 39 kjv  the other account is found in deuteronomy 106 where aaron died at moserah and was buried name jd3   there is a significant amount of travel between these two points as the itinerary in numbers 3331–37 records seven stages between moseroth mosera and mount hor name jd3   aaron was 123 at the time of his death name colliers

aaron married  daughter of  and sister of   623 of the tribe of judah  the sons of aaron were   and  a descendant of aaron is an aaronite or  meaning priest   any non aaronic —ie descended from levi but not from aaron —assisted the levitical priests of the family of aaron in the care of the tabernacle later of the temple group   noteaccording to samaritan sources a civil war once broke out between the sons of itamar  and the sons of phineas that resulted in a division of those who followed eli and those who followed high priest uzzi ben bukki at mount gerizim bethel a third group followed neither ironically and likewise according to samaritan sources the high priests line of the sons of phineas died out in 1624 ce with the death of the 112th high priest shlomyah ben pinhas at which time the priesthood was transferred to the sons of itamar see article samaritan for list of high priests from 1613 to 2004—the 131st high priest of the samaritans is  also see article  
the  records that the priest  his wife  and theore their son  were descendants of aaron 
the older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth men without the spirit of god and lacking the will power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities name jd2  thus aaron the first priest ranks below moses he is his mouthpiece and the executor of the will of god revealed through moses although it is pointed outsifra wa yiḳra 1  that it is said fifteen times in the  that the lord spoke to moses and aaron under the influence of the priesthood that shaped the destinies of the nation under  rule a different ideal of the priest was formed according to  24–7 and the prevailing tendency was to place aaron on a footing equal with moses name jd2  at times aaron and at other times moses is mentioned first in scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank says  who strongly implies this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of aarons ministration name jd2 
in fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head  x  cxxxiii 1 aarons death as described in the  was of a wonderful tranquility name jd4  accompanied by moses his brother and by eleazar his son aaron went to the summit of mount hor where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son eleazar said moses and then follow me name jd4  aaron did as commanded and they entered the cave where was prepared a bed around which angels stood go lie down upon thy bed my brother moses continued and aaron obeyed without a murmur name jd4  then his soul departed as if by a kiss from god the cave closed behind moses as he left and he went down the hill with eleazar with garments rent and crying alas aaron my brother thou the pillar of supplication of israel name jd4  when the israelites cried in bewilderment where is aaron angels were seen carrying aarons bier through the air name jd4  a voice was then heard saying the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found on his lips he walked with me in righteousness and brought many back from sin malachi 26 name jd4  he died according to  ix r h 2 3a on the first of ab name jd4  the pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of israels camp disappeared at aarons death see seder olam ix and r h 2b 3a name jd4  the seeming contradiction between numbers 2022 et seq and deuteronomy 106 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner aarons death on mount hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of arad in consequence of which the israelites fled marching seven stations backward to mosera where they performed the rites of mourning for aaron wheore it is said there at mosera died aaron name jd4  group   notesee mek beshallaḥ wayassa i tan huḳḳat 18 yer soṭah i 17c and targum yer num and deut on the abovementioned passages 
the rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united aaron and moses when the latter was appointed ruler and aaron high priest neither betrayed any jealousy instead they rejoiced in one anothers greatness when moses at first declined to go to pharaoh saying o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send exodus 413 he was unwilling to deprive aaron his brother of the high position the latter had held for so many years but the lord reassured him saying behold when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart  name jd4  indeed aaron was to find his reward says  for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brothers rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the  which were to be upon aarons heart when he goeth in before the lord  i 10 name jd4  moses and aaron met in gladness of heart kissing each other as true brothers exodus 427 compare  81 and of them it is written behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity psalms 1331 name jd4  of them it is said mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other psalms 8510 for moses stood for righteousness according to deuteronomy 3321 and aaron for peace according to  again mercy was personified in aaron according to deuteronomy 338 and truth in moses according to numbers 127  name jd4 tan shemot ed buber 24 26 
when moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of aaron aaron modestly shrank back and said who knows whether i have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office then the  spoke the words behold the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard of aaron that even went down to the skirts of his garment is as pure as the dew of hermon   name jd4 sifra shemini milluim tan korah ed buber 14 
according to ed buber 212  aarons activity as a prophet began earlier than that of moses name jd2  hillel held aaron up as an example saying be of the disciples of aaron loving peace and pursuing peace love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the law  this is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in abot de rabbi natan 12  6b and elsewhere according to which aaron was an ideal priest of the people far more beloved for his kindly ways than was moses name jd3  while moses was stern and uncompromising brooking no wrong aaron went about as peacemaker reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled and winning evil doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse  the mourning of the people at aarons death was greater theore than at that of moses for whereas when aaron died the whole  wept including the women numbers 2029 name jd4   moses was bewailed by the sons of israel only deuteronomy 348 name jd4   even in the making of the golden calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for aaron name jd4 sanhedrin 7a  his fortitude and silent submission to the will of god on the loss of his two sons are erred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify god in the midst of great affliction name jd4  115b  especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by god after the princes of the  had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared tabernacle say to thy brother aaron greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift for thou art called upon to kindle the light and while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the temple lasts thy light shall last forever name jd4  ed buber בהעלותך 6 
in the  and  churches aaron is  as a  whose  is shared with his brother moses and celebrated on september 4 those churches that follow the traditional  celebrate this day on september 17 of the modern  aaron is also commemorated with other old testament saints on the sunday of the holy fathers the sunday before 
aaron is commemorated as one of the holy foathers in the  on july 30  he is commemorated on july 1 in the modern latin calendar and in the syriac calendar
in  the  order is the lesser order of priesthood comprising the grades from lowest to highest of deacon teacher and priest the chief office of the aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric  the head of the priesthood is the bishop each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the aaronic priesthood 
in the  the  is regarded as an appendage to the  and consists of the priesthood offices of deacon teacher and priest while differing in responsibilities these offices along with those of the melchisidec order are regarded as equal before god
aaron  هارون hārūn is also mentioned in the  as a  of   the quran praises aaron repeatedly calling him a believing servant  as well as one who was guided  and one of the victors  aaron is important in  for his role in the events of  in which according to the quran and   he preached with his brother  to the   aarons significance in islam however is not limited to his role as the helper of moses islamic tradition also accords aaron the role of a  as tradition records that the priestly descent came through aarons lineage which included the entire 
 
the  contains numerous erences to aaron both by name and without name it says that he was a descendant of abraham quran 4 163 and makes it clear that both he and moses were sent together to warn the pharaoh about gods punishment quran 10 75 it further adds that moses had earlier prayed to god to strengthen his own ministry with aaron quran 20 29 30 and that aaron helped moses as he too was a prophet quran 19 53 and was very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse quran 28 34 the quran adds that both moses and aaron were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the israelites in egypt and to convert those houses into places of worship for god quran 10 87
the incident of the golden calf as it is narrated in the quran paints aaron in a positive light the quran says that aaron was entrusted the leadership of israel while moses was up on  for a period of forty days quran 7 142 it adds that aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the golden calf which was built not by aaron but by a wicked man by the name of  quran 19 50 when moses returned from mount sinai he rebuked aaron for allowing the worship of the idol to which aaron pleaded with moses to not blame him when he had no role in its construction quran 7 150 the quran then adds that moses here lamented the sins of israel and said he only had the power to protect himself and aaron quran 5 25
aaron is later commemorated in the quran as one who had a clear authority quran 23 45 and one who was guided to the right path quran 37 118 it further adds that aarons memory was left for people who came after him quran 37 119 and he is blessed by god along with his brother quran 37 120 the quran also calls the  a sister of aaron quran 19 28 muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this aaron was in terms of his historical persona with some saying that it was a erence to aaron of the exodus and the term sister designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures all the more evident when mary was a descendant of the priestly lineage of aaron while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of  by the name of aaron most scholars have agreed to the former perspective and have linked mary spiritually with the actual sister of aaron her namesake  whom she resembled in many ways the quran also narrates that centuries later when the  returned to israel it contained relics from the family of moses and relics from the family of aaron quran 2 248
 
 in many of his sayings speaks of aaron in the event of the  his miraculous ascension through the heavens muhammad is said to have encountered aaron in the fifth heaven name muslim   according to old scholars including  muhammad in particular mentioned the beauty of aaron when he encountered him in heaven  in his biographical muhammad speaks of muhammads wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory
aaron was also mentioned by muhammad in likeness to  muhammad had left ali to look after his family but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found ali a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence ali grieved at hearing this wicked taunt told muhammad what the local people were saying in reply the prophet said they lie i bade thee remain for the sake of what i had left behind me so return and represent me in my family and in thine art thou not content o ali that thou should be unto me as aaron was unto moses save that after me there is no prophet  
 
according to islamic tradition the  is located on jabal harun or aarons mountain near  in    at 1350 meters above sea level it is the highest peak in the area and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here a 14th century  mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around petra
although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet aaron is merely described as a prophet the kitab i iqan describes imran as being his father  
aaron appears paired with moses frequently in jewish and christian art especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed bibles name watt3  he can usually be distinguished by his priestly vestments especially his turban or miter and jeweled breastplate he frequently holds a censor or sometimes his flowering rod see  at wikimedia commons aaron also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness tabernacle and its altar as already in the third century frescos in the  at  in syria an eleventh century portable silver altar from  germany depicts aaron with his censor and is located in the  in  this is also how he appears in the frontispieces of early printed passover haggadot and occasionally in church sculptures aaron has rarely been the subject of portraits such as those by  1710–1747 and by  c 1650 name kline  christian artists sometimes portray aaron as a prophet exod 71 holding a scroll as in a twelfth century sculpture from the  in the  new york and often in eastern orthodox icons illustrations of the  story usually include him as well—most notably in s  ca 1633–34  london  finally some artists interested in validating later priesthoods have painted the ordination of aaron and his sons leviticus 8 s realistic portrayal is often reproduced in the literature of the latter day saints group  noteharry andersons aaron is called to the ministry’ is in the conference center of the lds church in salt lake city utah  name watt3

in  an alcohol is any  in which the   – is bound to a   atom   the term alcohol originally erred to the primary alcohol  ethyl alcohol the predominant alcohol in s
the suffix  ol appears in the  of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority in substances where a higher priority group is present the pix hydroxy  will appear in the  iupac name the suffix  ol in non systematic names such as  or  also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and so can be termed an alcohol but many substances particularly sugars examples  and  contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix an important class of alcohols of which  and ethanol are the simplest members is the  alcohols the general formula for which is csubn subhsub2n+1 suboh
 as a  byproduct of the  of yeast as such ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit
 in the   of many varieties of bacteria and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment
alcohols have been found outside the  where they can be found in low densities in star and planetary system forming regions of space http  wwwlabnewscouk news giant cloud of space alcohol found 04 04 2006  
 ethanol is thought to cause harm partly as a result of direct damage to dna caused by its metabolites 
ethanols toxicity is largely caused by its primary metabolite  systematically ethanal name ceri  name ns poison  and secondary metabolite  name ns poison      many primary alcohols are metabolized into aldehydes then to carboxylic acids whose toxicities are similar to acetaldehyde and acetic acid metabolite toxicity is reduced in rats fed  name ceri    and  
tertiary alcohols cannot be metabolized into aldehydes  and as a result they cause no hangover or toxicity through this mechanism
some  and  are less poisonous than ethanol because the liver is unable to metabolize them into toxic by products  this makes them more suitable for pharmaceutical use as the chronic harms are lower   and  are tertiary alcohols which have seen both medicinal and recreational use name adriani 
other alcohols are substantially more poisonous than ethanol partly because they take much longer to be metabolized and partly because their metabolism produces substances that are even more toxic methanol wood alcohol for instance is oxidized to  and then to the poisonous  in the liver by  and  s respectively accumulation of formic acid can lead to blindness or death name schep  likewise poisoning due to other alcohols such as  or  are due to their metabolites which are also produced by alcohol dehydrogenase name brent 2009  
methanol itself while poisonous  5628ampnbspmg kg oral rat name chemsisnlmnihgov  has a much weaker  effect than ethanol
isopropyl alcohol is oxidized to form acetone by  in the liver but has occasionally been abused by  leading to a range of adverse health effects  
an effective treatment to prevent toxicity after methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion is to administer ethanol alcohol dehydrogenase has a higher affinity for ethanol thus preventing methanol from binding and acting as a  any remaining methanol will then have time to be excreted through the kidneys name schep   
 is used in scientific publications and where precise identification of the substance is important especially in cases where the relative complexity of the molecule does not make such a systematic name unwieldy in the iupac system in naming simple alcohols the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal e and adds ol eg as in methanol and ethanol name   reusch alcohols  when necessary the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the ol  for chsub3 subchsub2 subchsub2 suboh  for chsub3 subchohchsub3 sub if a higher priority group is present such as an   or  then the pix hydroxy is used name   reusch alcohols  eg as in 1 hydroxy 2 propanone chsub3 subcochsub2 subohorganic chemistry iupac nomenclature http  wwwacdlabscom iupac nomenclature 79 r79_202htm alcohols rule c 201 
in other less formal contexts an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word alcohol eg  alcohol  alcohol  alcohol may be  or  depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the end or middle carbon on the straight  chain as described under systematic naming if another group on the molecule takes priority the alcohol moiety is often indicated using the hydroxy  pix
alcohols are then classified into primary secondary sec  s  and tertiary tert  t  based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the   the respective numeric shorthands 1° 2° and 3° are also sometimes used in informal settings  the primary alcohols have general formulas rchsub2 suboh methanol chsub3 suboh is the simplest primary alcohol r h and after it ethanol r chsub3 sub secondary alcohols can be erred to with the shorthand rrchoh 2 propanol is the simplest example  r r chsub3 sub tertiary alcohols can be erred to with the shorthand rrrcoh  2 methylpropan 2 ol is the simplest example r r r chsub3 sub in these shorthands r r and r represent  alkyl or other attached generally organic groups

short chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 1 3 carbons medium chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 4 7 carbons long chain alcohols also known as  have alkyl chains of 8 21 carbons and very long chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 22 carbons or longer 
 
simple alcohols appears to be a completely undefined term however simple alcohols are often erred to by common names derived by adding the word alcohol to the name of the appropriate alkyl group for instance a chain consisting of one carbon a methyl group chsub3 sub with an oh group attached to the carbon is called methyl alcohol while a chain of two carbons an ethyl group chsub2 subchsub3 sub with an oh group connected to the chsub2 sub is called ethyl alcohol for more complex alcohols the iupac nomenclature must be used 
simple alcohols in particular ethanol and methanol possess  and inert rendering properties leading to their use as anti microbial agents in medicine pharmacy and industry
 
encyclopædia britannica states the higher alcoholsampnbsp— those containing 4 to 10 carbon atomsampnbsp— are somewhat viscous or oily and they have heavier fruity odours some of the highly branched alcohols and many alcohols containing more than 12 carbon atoms are solids at room temperature 
like ethanol  can be produced by fermentation processes saccharomyces yeast are known to produce these higher alcohols at temperatures above  the bacterium  can feed on  to produce butanol on an industrial scale
the word alcohol appears in english as a term for a very fine powder in the sixteenth century it was borrowed from french which took it from medical 
ultimately the word is from the     a powder used as an eyeliner  is the arabic  equivalent to the in english alcohol was originally used for the very fine powder produced by the  of the natural mineral  to form   sub2 subsub3 sub hence the essence or spirit of the substance which was used as an  eyeliner and cosmetic see  according to this theory the meaning of alkuhul would have been first extended to distilled substances in general and then narrowed to ethanol name viashttp  wwwviasorg encyclopedia alcohol_004html etymology of the word alcohol 
 in his 1543 translation of  introduces the word as a term used by barbarous  authors for fine powder  vigo wrote the barbarous auctours use alcohol or as i fynde it sometymes wryten alcofoll for moost fine poudre
the 1657 https  booksgooglecom books about lexicon_chymicumhtmlid d645aaaacaaj lexicon chymicum by william johnson glosses the word as antimonium sive stibium by extension the word came to er to any fluid obtained by distillation including alcohol of wine the distilled essence of wine  in alchymia 1594 ers to vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum johnson 1657 glosses alcohol vini as quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat the words meaning became restricted to spirit of wine the chemical known today as  in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so called as alcohols in modern chemistry after 1850
however this derivation is dubious since the current arabic name for alcohol  is الغول al ġawl – properly meaning spirit or demon – with the sense the thing that gives the wine its headiness in the quran  verse 47 name vias 
the term ethanol was invented 1838 modeled on the german word äthyl liebig which is in turn based on greek aither  and  hyle stuff 
alcohols have an odor that is often described as “biting” and as “hanging” in the nasal passages ethanol has a slightly sweeter or more fruit like odor than the other alcohols
in general the  makes the alcohol molecule  those groups can form s to one another and to other compounds except in  where the hydroxyl is protected by  of adjacent groups name maje
  this hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as s two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are the tendency of the polar oh to promote solubility in water and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it thus methanol ethanol and propanol are  in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain  with a four carbon chain is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends alcohols of five or more carbons such as  and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chains dominance all simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents
because of  alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable s and s the boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 7829ampnbsp°c compared to 69ampnbsp°c for the hydrocarbon  a common constituent of  and 346ampnbsp°c for 
alcohols like water can show either acidic or basic properties at the  oh group with a  of around 16 19 they are in general slightly weaker s than  but they are still able to react with strong bases such as  or reactive metals such as  the s that result are called s with the general formula osup− sup sup+ sup
meanwhile the oxygen atom has s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly  in the presence of strong acids such as  for example with methanol
alcohols can also undergo  to give s s or s or they can be dehydrated to s they can react to form s and they can if activated first undergo  reactions the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols s for more details see the  section below
as one moves from primary to secondary to tertiary alcohols with the same backbone the hydrogen bond strength the boiling point and the acidity typically decrease
alcohol has a long history of several uses worldwide it is found in alcoholic beverages sold to adults as fuel and also has many scientific medical and industrial uses the term alcohol free is often used to describe a product that does not contain alcohol some consumers of some commercially prepared products may view alcohol as an undesirable ingredient particularly in products intended for children
s typically containing 340%  by volume have been produced and consumed by humans since pre historic times other alcohols such as  found in  and  ghb are also consumed by humans for their psychoactive effects
a 50%  by volume solution of  in water is commonly used as an 
ethanol can be used as an  to disinfect the skin before injections are given often along with  ethanol based s are becoming common in restaurants and are convenient because they do not require drying due to the volatility of the compound alcohol based gels have become common as s
some alcohols mainly  and  can be used as an  fuel performance can be increased in  s by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the  or  has pressurized the air this cools the pressurized air providing a denser air charge which allows for more fuel and theore more power
alcohol is often used as a  for  in the fields of science and medicine
hydroxyl groups  oh found in alcohols are  and theore  water loving but their carbon chain portion is  which make them  the molecule increasingly becomes overall more nonpolar and theore less soluble in the polar water as the carbon chain becomes longer  methanol has the shortest carbon chain of all alcohols one carbon atom followed by ethanol two carbon atoms
alcohols have applications in industry and science as reagents or s because of its relatively low toxicity compared with other alcohols and ability to dissolve  substances ethanol can be used as a solvent in medical drugs s and vegetable essences such as  in  alcohols serve as versatile intermediates
in the  linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and  followed by oxidation and hydrolysis name falbejürgen falbe helmut bahrmann wolfgang lipps dieter mayer alcohols aliphatic in ullmanns encyclopedia of chemical technology wiley vch verlag weinheim 2002    an idealized synthesis of  is shown
alcsub2 subhsub5 subsub3 sub  +  9 csub2 subhsub4 sub   →  alcsub8 subhsub17 subsub3 sub
alcsub8 subhsub17 subsub3 sub +  3 o  +  3 hsub2 subo  →  3 hocsub8 subhsub17 sub  +  alohsub3 sub
the process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by 
many higher alcohols are produced by  of alkenes followed by hydrogenation when applied to a terminal alkene as is common one typically obtains a linear alcohol name falbe   
rch chsub2 sub  +  hsub2 sub  +  co   →  rchsub2 subchsub2 subcho
rchsub2 subchsub2 subcho +  3 hsub2 sub  →  rchsub2 subchsub2 subchsub2 suboh
such processes give s which are useful for detergents
low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes ethanol isopropanol 2 butanol and tert butanol are produced by this general method two implementations are employed the direct and indirect methods the direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates typically using acid catalysts in the indirect method the alkene is converted to the  which is subsequently hydrolyzed the direct  using   name ect4 820  or other alkenes from  of fractions of distilled 
hydration is also used industrially to produce the diol  from 
ethanol is obtained by  using  produced from sugar from the  of  in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37ampnbsp°c to produce ethanol for instance such a process might proceed by the conversion of  by the enzyme  into  and  then the conversion of  by the enzyme  into  and carbon dioxide
several of the benign bacteria in the intestine use  as a form of  this  reaction produces  as a waste product just like  produces  and  thus human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria in rare cases this can be sufficient to cause  in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced   
    this section is linked from    
several methods exist for the preparation of alcohols in the laboratory
 
primary s react with aqueous  or  mainly to primary alcohols in  secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination alkene product instead s react with  groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols related reactions are the  and the 
 
 or s are  with  or  after an acidic workup another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the   is the asymmetric reduction of β keto esters

alcohols can behave as weak acids undergoing  the deprotonation reaction to produce an  salt is performed either with a strong base such as sodium hydride or  or with sodium or potassium metal

 2 r oh + 2  → 2 r osup− supnasup+ sup + hsub2 sub
 2  + 2 na → 2 chsub3 sub chsub2 sub osup− supnasup+ sup + hsub2 sub↑
water is similar in  to many alcohols so with  there is an  set up which usually lies to the left
 r oh + naoh ⇌ r osup− supnasup+ sup + hsub2 subo equilibrium to the left
it should be noted however that the bases used to deprotonate alcohols are strong themselves the bases used and the alkoxides created are both highly moisture sensitive chemical reagents
the acidity of alcohols is also affected by the overall stability of the alkoxide ion s attached to the carbon containing the hydroxyl group will serve to stabilize the alkoxide when formed thus resulting in greater acidity on the other hand the presence of  will result in a less stable alkoxide ion formed this will result in a scenario whereby the unstable alkoxide ion formed will tend to accept a proton to orm the original alcohol
with s alkoxides give rise to s in the 
the oh group is not a good  in  reactions so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions however if the oxygen is first protonated to give r−ohsub2 subsup+ sup the leaving group  is much more stable and the nucleophilic substitution can take place for instance tertiary alcohols react with  to produce tertiary s where the  is replaced by a  atom by  if primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with  an activator such as  is needed in alternative fashion the conversion may be performed directly using sup1 sup
alcohols may likewise be converted to alkyl bromides using  or  for example
 3 r oh + pbrsub3 sub → 3 rbr + hsub3 subposub3 sub
in the  an alcohol is deoxygenated to an  with  or a  water complex in a  reaction
alcohols are themselves nucleophilic so r−ohsub2 subsup+ sup can react with roh to produce s and water in a  although this reaction is rarely used except in the manufacture of

achill island   in  is the largest island off the coast of  and is situated off the west coast it has a population of 2700 its area is  achill is attached to the mainland by  between the villages of gob an choire  and poll raithní  a  was first completed here in 1887 replaced by another structure in 1949 and subsequently replaced with the current bridge which was completed in 2008 other centres of population include the villages of keel  dumha Éige  dooniver the valley and dugort the parishs main  pitch and two s are on the mainland at poll raithní early s are believed to have been established on achill around 3000 bc a paddle dating from this period was found at the  near dookinella
the island is 87%  the parish of achill also includes the  some of the people of curraun consider themselves achill people and most natives of achill er to this area as being in achill there are between 500 600 native irish speakers in achill parish in the summer of 1996 the  decided to station a  at kildownet
it is believed that at the end of the  around 4000 bc achill had a population of 500–1000 people the island would have been mostly forest until the neolithic people began  settlement increased during the  and the dispersal of small s around the coast indicate the warlike nature of the times s see picture right and forts can be seen at slievemore along the atlantic drive and on 
achill island lies in the barony of  in the territory of ancient  umhall uactarach and umhall ioctarach that originally encompassed an area extending from the  mayo border to achill head
the hereditary chieftains of umhall were the omalleys recorded in the area in 814 ad when they successfully repelled an onslaught by the vikings in  the  invasion of  in 1235 ad saw the territory of umhall taken over by the butlers and later by the de burgos the butler lordship of burrishoole continued into the late 14th century when thomas le botiller was recorded as being in possession of akkyll amp owyll
in the 17th and 18th centuries there was much migration to achill from other parts of ireland particularly  due to the political and religious turmoil of the time for a while there were two different s of irish being spoken on achill this led to many townlands being recorded as having two names during the 1824  and some maps today give different names for the same place achill irish still has many traces of

one of achills most famous historical sites is that of the  or the colony at dugort in 1831 the  reverend edward nangle founded a  mission at dugort the mission included schools cottages an orphanage an infirmary and a guesthouse the colony was very successful for a time and regularly produced a newspaper called the achill herald and western witness nangle expanded his mission into mweelin where a school was built the achill mission began to decline slowly after nangle was moved from achill and was finally closed in the 1880s nangle died in 1883
 
in 1894 the westport   newport railway line was extended to achill sound the train station is now a hostel the train provided a great service to achill but it also fulfilled an ancient prophecy brian rua o cearbhain had prophesied that carts on iron wheels would carry bodies into achill on their first and last journey in 1894 the first train on the achill railway carried the bodies of victims of the  this tragedy occurred when a boat overturned in clew bay drowning thirty two young people they had been going to meet the steamer which would take them to scotland for potato picking

though early on ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer he wrote poetry for most of his life most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol  his admiration for the writing of jack kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously though he took odd jobs to support himself in 1955 upon the advice of a psychiatrist ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry soon after he wrote howl the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life later in life ginsberg entered academia teaching poetry as distinguished professor of english at  from 1986 until his death
since ginsbergs poetry is intensely personal and since much of the vitality of those associated with the  comes from mutual inspiration much credit for style inspiration and content can be given to ginsbergs friends
ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was kerouacs concept of spontaneous prose he believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions ginsberg was much more prone to revise than kerouac for example when kerouac saw the first draft of howl he disliked the fact that ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil transposing negro and angry in the first line for example kerouac only wrote out his concepts of spontaneous prose at ginsbergs insistence because ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry name miles 
the inspiration for howl was ginsbergs friend  and howl is dedicated to solomon whom ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem solomon was a  and  enthusiast he introduced ginsberg to  who suffered bouts of depression solomon wanted to commit suicide but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy the institution used giving him many forms of  including  much of the final section of the first part of howl is a description of this
ginsberg used solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of  moloch to whom the second section is addressed is a  to whom children were sacrificed ginsberg may have gotten the name from the  poem thou shalt not kill a poem about the death of one of ginsbergs heroes  moloch is mentioned a few times in the  and erences to ginsbergs jewish background are not infrequent in his work ginsberg said the image of moloch was inspired by  visions he had of the francis drake hotel in san francisco which appeared to him as a skull he took it as a symbol of the city not specifically san francisco but all cities ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the francis drake hotel were memories of the moloch of s film  1927 and of the woodcut novels of ginsberg allen 1986 howl original draft facsimile transcript amp variant versions barry miles ed new york harper pp 139–140 ward also illustrated a later broadside version of howl which can be seen in the cited pages  moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control including the conformist society of post–world war ii america focused on material gain which ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms name miles 
he also made sure to emphasize that moloch is a part of all of us the decision to defy socially created systems of control—and theore go against moloch—is a form of self destruction many of the characters ginsberg erences in howl such as neal cassady and herbert huncke destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle the personal aspects of howl are perhaps as important as the political aspects carl solomon the prime example of a best mind destroyed by defying society is associated with ginsbergs schizophrenic mother the line with mother finally  fucked comes after a long section about carl solomon and in part iii ginsberg says im with you in rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write howl was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly he dealt with it directly with 1959s kaddish name miles  which had its first public reading at a  friday night meeting possibly due to its associations with 
 
ginsbergs poetry was strongly influenced by  most importantly the american style of modernism pioneered by william carlos williams  specifically william blake and  the beat and cadence of  specifically that of  musicians such as  and his   practice and jewish background he considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the english poet and artist william blake the american poet walt whitman and the spanish poet  the power of ginsbergs verse its searching probing focus its long and lilting lines as well as its  exuberance all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed name miles  name deliberate  name spontaneous 
he corresponded with william carlos williams who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem  about the industrial city near his home after attending a reading by williams ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like thee williams disliked the poems and told ginsberg in this mode perfection is basic and these poems are not perfect name miles  name deliberate  name spontaneous 
though he disliked these early poems williams loved the exuberance in ginsbergs letter he included the letter in a later part of paterson he encouraged ginsberg not to emulate the old masters but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common american from williams ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images in line with williams own motto no ideas but in things studying williams style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose colloquial free verse style early breakthrough poems include bricklayers lunch hour and dream record name miles  name spontaneous 
carl solomon introduced ginsberg to the work of antonin artaud to have done with the judgement of god and van gogh the man suicided by society and jean genet our lady of the flowers  introduced him to other  and surrealism continued to be an influence for example sections of kaddish were inspired by s free union ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of howl and other poems was inspired by christopher smart in such poems as jubilate agno ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences such as     and even  name miles  name deliberate 
ginsberg also made an intense study of  and the paintings of  from which he adapted a concept important to his work which he called the eyeball kick he noticed in viewing cézannes paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color the eye would  or kick likewise he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku ginsberg used this technique in his poetry putting together two starkly dissimilar images something weak with something strong an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture something holy with something unholy the example ginsberg most often used was hydrogen jukebox which later became the title of a  composed by  with lyrics drawn from ginsbergs poems another example is ginsbergs observation on bob dylan during dylans hectic and intense 1966 electric guitar tour fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines  opiates  alcohol  and psychedelics  as a  clown the phrases eyeball kick and hydrogen jukebox both show up in howl as well as a direct quote from cézanne pater omnipotens aeterna deus name deliberate 
allen ginsberg also found inspiration in music he frequently included music in his poetry he wrote and recorded music to accompany william blake’s songs of innocence and songs of experience he also recorded a hand full of other albums to create music for howl and wichita vortex sutra he worked with the neo classical composer philip glass
ginsberg has worked with inspired and drew inspiration from artists such as bob dylan paul mccartney the clash patti smith phil ochs and the fugs name schumacher michael 2002

from the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friends—not to mention his own experiments—ginsberg developed an individualistic style thats easily identified as ginsbergianhttp  wwwakehacettepeedutr install jastfiles jast27pdf tv interview 1982  and  discuss beats in the context of  special  issue turkey  howl came out during a potentially hostile literary environment less welcoming to non traditional free verse poetry there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by  consequently ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long free verse lines often citing whitmans free verse used in leaves of grass as a precursor ginsberg claimed whitmans long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further and whitman is also often compared to ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form name miles  name deliberate  name spontaneous 
ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality though some critics like diana trilling have pointed to ginsbergs occasional use of meter for example the anapest of who came back to denver and waited in vain ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the natural poetic voice 
ginsberg said that he learned from william carlos williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally like williams ginsbergs line breaks were often determined by breath one line in howl for example should be read in one breath ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths
many of ginsbergs early long line experiments contain some sort of  repetition of a fixed base for example who in howl america in america and this has become a recognizable feature of ginsbergs style  he said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence he did not yet trust free flight in the 1960s after employing it in some sections of kaddish caw for example he for the most part abandoned the anaphoric form name deliberate  name spontaneous 
several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems in the original draft of howl each line is in a stepped triadic format reminiscent of  but he abandoned the stepped triadic when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later most significantly in the travelogues of the fall of america howl and kaddish arguably his two most important poems are both organized as an inverted pyramid with larger sections leading to smaller sections in america he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines name deliberate  name spontaneous 
in howl and in his other poetry ginsberg drew inspiration from the   style of the 19th century american poet ginsberg allen deliberate prose pp 285–331  both wrote passionately about the promise and betrayal of american democracy the central importance of erotic experience and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence  editor of the  called ginsberg the best known american poet of his generation as much a social force as a literary phenomenon mcclatchy added that ginsberg like whitman was a bard in the old manner – outsized darkly prophetic part exuberance part prayer part rant his work is finally a history of our eras psyche with all its contradictory urges mcclatchys barbed eulogies define the essential difference between ginsberg a beat poet whose writing was  journalism raised by combining the recycling genius with a generous mimic empathy to strike audience accessible chords always lyrical and sometimes truly poetic and kerouac a poet of singular brilliance the brightest luminary of a beat generation he came to symbolise in popular culture though in reality he far surpassed his contemporaries kerouac is an originating genius exploring then answering   like rimbaud a century earlier by necessity more than by choice   the demands of authentic self expression as applied to the evolving quicksilver mind of americas only literary virtuoso name   nyt

in  an algebraically closed field f contains a  for every  in fx the  in the variable x with coefficients in f
as an example the  of s is not algebraically closed because the polynomial equation xsup2 supampnbsp+ampnbsp1ampnbsp ampnbsp0ampnbsp has no solution in real numbers even though all its coefficients 1 and 0 are real  the same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed in particular the field of s is not algebraically closed also no  f is algebraically closed because if asub1 sub asub2 sub … asubn sub are the elements of f then the polynomial xampnbspampminusampnbspasub1 subxampnbspampminusampnbspasub2 subampnbsp···ampnbspxampnbspampminusampnbspasubn subampnbsp+ampnbsp1
has no zero in f by contrast the  states that the field of s is algebraically closed another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of complex s
given a field f the assertion f is algebraically closed is equivalent to other assertions
the field f is algebraically closed if and only if the only s in the  fx are those of degree one
the assertion the polynomials of degree one are irreducible is trivially true for any field if f is algebraically closed and px is an irreducible polynomial of fx then it has some root a and theore px is a multiple of xampnbspampminusampnbspa since px is irreducible this means that pxampnbsp ampnbspkxampnbspampminusampnbspa for some kampnbsp∈ampnbspfampnbsp\ampnbsp{0} on the other hand if f is not algebraically closed then there is some non constant polynomial px in fx without roots in f let qx be some irreducible factor of px since px has no roots in f qx also has no roots in f theore qx has degree greater than one since every first degree polynomial has one root in f
the field f is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial px of degree nampnbsp≥ampnbsp1 with s in f  in other words there are elements kampnbspxsub1 subampnbspxsub2 subampnbsp…ampnbspxsubn sub of the field f such that pxampnbsp ampnbspkxampnbspampminusampnbspxsub1 subxampnbspampminusampnbspxsub2 subampnbsp···ampnbspxampnbspampminusampnbspxsubn sub
if f has this property then clearly every non constant polynomial in fx has some root in f in other words f is algebraically closed on the other hand that the property stated here holds for f if f is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that for any field k any polynomial in kx can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials
j shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over f of prime degree has a root in f then every non constant polynomial has a root in f thus f is algebraically closed
the field f is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper 
if f has no proper algebraic extension let px be some irreducible polynomial in fx then the  of fx modulo the  generated by px is an algebraic extension of f whose  is equal to the degree of px since it is not a proper extension its degree is 1 and theore the degree of px isampnbsp1
on the other hand if f has some proper algebraic extension k then the  of an element in kampnbsp\ampnbspf is irreducible and its degree is greater thanampnbsp1
the field f is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite  because if within the  the word algebraic is replaced by the word finite then the proof is still valid
the field f is algebraically closed if and only if for each natural number n every  from fsupn sup into itself has some 
an endomorphism of fsupn sup has an eigenvector if and only if its  has some root theore when f is algebraically closed every endomorphism of fsupn sup has some eigenvector on the other hand if every endomorphism of fsupn sup has an eigenvector let px be an element of fx dividing by its leading coefficient we get another polynomial qx which has roots if and only if px has roots but if qxampnbsp ampnbspxsupn supampnbsp+ampnbspasubnampnbspampminusampnbsp1 subxsupnampnbspampminusampnbsp1 sup+ampnbsp···ampnbsp+ampnbspasub0 sub then qx is the characteristic polynomial of the 
math\begin{pmatrix}0amp0amp\cdotsamp0amp a_0\\1amp0amp\cdotsamp0amp a_1\\0amp1amp\cdotsamp0amp a_2\\\vdotsamp\vdotsamp\ddotsamp\vdotsamp\vdots\\0amp0amp\cdotsamp1amp a_{n 1}\end{pmatrix} math
the field f is algebraically closed if and only if every  in one variable x with coefficients in f can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form a xampnbspampminusampnbspbsupn sup where n is a natural number and a and b are elements of f
if f is algebraically closed then since the irreducible polynomials in fx are all of degree 1 the property stated above holds by the 
on the other hand suppose that the property stated above holds for the field f let px be an irreducible element in fx then the rational function 1 p can be written as the sum of a polynomial function q with rational functions of the form a xampnbspampminusampnbspbsupn sup theore the rational expression
math\frac1{px} qx \frac{1 pxqx}{px} math
can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials since px is irreducible it must divide this product and theore it must also be a first degree polynomial
for any field f if two polynomials pxqxampnbsp∈ampnbspfx are  then they do not have a common root for if aampnbsp∈ampnbspf was a common root thenampnbsppx and ampnbspqx would both be multiples of xampnbspampminusampnbspa and theore they would not be relatively prime the fields for which the reverse implication holds that is the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime are precisely the algebraically closed fields
if the field f is algebraically closed let px and qx be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let rx be their  then since rx is not constant it will have some root a which will be then a common root of px and qx
if f is not algebraically closed let px be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots then px and px are not relatively prime but they have no common roots since none of them has roots
if f is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number then f contains all nth roots of unity because these are by definition the n not necessarily distinct zeroes of the polynomial xsupn supampnbspampminusampnbsp1 a field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed the converse is not true even assuming that every polynomial of the form xsupn supampnbspampminusampnbspa splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed
if a proposition which can be expressed in the language of  is true for an algebraically closed field then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same  furthermore if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristicampnbsp0 then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristicampnbsp0 but there is some natural number n such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristicampnbspp when pampnbspampgtampnbspnsee subsections rings and fields and properties of mathematical theories in §2 of j barwises an introduction to first order logic 
every field f has some extension which is algebraically closed among all such extensions there is one and  but not  only one which is an  of fsee langs algebra §vii2 or van der waerdens algebra i §101  it is called the  of f

anatoly yevgenyevich karpov   anatolij evgenevič karpov born may 23 1951 is a russian   and former  he was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by  he played three matches against kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990 before becoming  world champion once again after kasparov broke away from fide in 1993 he held the title until 1999 when he resigned his title in protest against fides new world championship rules for his decades long standing among the worlds elite karpov is considered by many to be one of the  of all time
his tournament successes include over 160 first place finishes however in his 1994 book my best games karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches and won more than 100  he had a peak  of 2780 and his 90 total months at world number one is  behind only  since the inception of the fide ranking list in 1970
since 2005 he has been a member of the  he has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes such as advocating the use of http  wwwuniceforg ceecis reallives_1345html unicef website  on december 17 2012 karpov supportedhttp  votedumagovru vote 79982  the law in the russian parliament banning adoption of russian orphans by citizens of the us
karpov was born on may 23 1951how karpov wins   page xiii deep blue an artificial intelligence milestone   page 44 chess life amp review   volume 33   page 539  at  in the  region of the former soviet union and learned to play chess at the age of four his early rise in chess was swift as he became a  by age eleven at twelve he was accepted into s prestigious chess school though botvinnik made the following remark about the young karpov the boy does not have a clue about chess and theres no future at all for him in this profession  karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time and wrote later that the homework which botvinnik assigned greatly helped him since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently name karpovonkarpov  karpov improved so quickly under botvinniks tutelage that he became the youngest  national master in history at fifteen in 1966 this tied the record established by  in 1952
karpov finished first in his first international tournament in  several months later ahead of  in 1967 he won the annual european junior championship at   karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school and entered  in 1968 to study  he later transferred to  eventually graduating from there in  one reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach grandmaster  who lived in leningrad in his writings karpov credits furman as a major influence on his development as a world class player
in 1969 karpov became the first soviet player since spassky 1955 to win the  scoring an undefeated 10 11 in the finals at   in 1970 he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in    and was awarded the  title
he won the 1971  memorial in moscow equal with  ahead of a star studded field for his first significant adult victory his  shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973 when he shared second in the  and finished equal first with  in the   tournament with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974  which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion 
karpov defeated  by the score of +3  5 in the first candidates match earning the right to face former champion  in the semifinal round karpov was on record saying that he believed spassky would easily beat him and win the candidates cycle to face fischer and that he karpov would win the following candidates cycle in 1977
spassky won the first game as black in good style but tenacious aggressive play from karpov secured him overall victory by +4 −1  6
the candidates final was played in moscow with korchnoi karpov took an early lead winning the second game against the  then scoring another victory in the sixth game following ten consecutive  korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give karpov a 3–0 lead in game 19 korchnoi succeeded in winning a long  then notched a speedy victory after a  by karpov two games later three more draws the last  by karpov in a clearly better position closed the match as he thus prevailed +3 −2  19 moving on to challenge fischer for the world title
though a world championship match between karpov and fischer was highly anticipated those hopes were never realized fischer insisted that the match be the first to ten wins  not counting but that the champion would retain the crown if the score was tied 9–9  the international chess federation used to allow this proviso and after fischers resignation of the championship on june 27 1975 fide declared that fischer forfeited his crown karpov later attempted to set up another match with fischer but all the negotiations fell through this thrust the young karpov into the role of world champion without having faced the reigning champion
 argued that karpov would have had good chances because he had beaten spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional and indeed had higher quality games while fischer had been inactive for three yearskasparov  part iv fischer p 474  spassky thought that fischer would have won in 1975 but karpov would have qualified again and beaten fischer in 1978in http  wwwchesscafecom text polgar26pdf an article pdf published in 2004 on the chesscafe website  wrote i spoke to boris spassky about this same issue and he believes that bobby would have won in 1975 but that anatoly would have won the rematch 
   this section is linked from    
determined to prove himself a legitimate champion karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years he convincingly won the very strong  tournament in 1975 and captured his first of three soviet titles in 1976 he created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories nine until it was shattered by  14
in 1978 karpovs first title defence was against korchnoi the opponent he had defeated in the 1973–75 candidates cycle the match was played at   with the winner needing six victories
as in 1974 karpov took an early lead winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match but korchnoi staged a comeback late in the match as after the score was +5 −2  20 in karpovs favour he won three of the next four games to draw level with karpov karpov then won the next game to retain the title +6 −5  21
three years later korchnoi re emerged as the candidates winner against german finalist dr  to challenge karpov in   this match however was won handily by karpov the score being 117 +6 −2  10 in what is remembered as the massacre in merano
karpovs tournament career reached a peak at the  tournament of stars tournament in 1979 where he finished joint first +7 −1  10 with  ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by   spassky   huebner  and  he dominated  1977 with 13½ 15 he also won the prestigious  tournament in 1978 shared and 1980 the  in 1981 shared with  and 1994 the  tournament in 1977 1979 1980 1982 and 1983 and the  in 1976 1983 and 1988
karpov represented the soviet union at six  in all of which the ussr won the team gold medal he played first reserve at  winning the board prize with 13 15 at  he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12 14 at  he was again board one and scored 9 12 at  he scored 6½ 8 on board one at  he scored 6 9 on board two his last was  where on board two he scored 8 10 in olympiad play karpov lost only two games out of 68 played
to illustrate karpovs dominance over his peers as champion his score was +11 −2  20 versus spassky +5  12 versus  +6 −1  16 versus  +3 −1  10 versus  +1  16 versus  +10 −2  13 versus ljubojević
karpov had cemented his position as the worlds best player and world champion by the time  arrived on the scene in their first match the  held in moscow with the victor again being the first to win six games outright karpov built a 4–0 lead after nine games the next seventeen games were drawn setting the record for world title matches and it took karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win in game 31 karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw he lost the next game after which fourteen more draws ensued in particular karpov held a solidly winning position in game 41 but again blundered and had to settle for a draw after kasparov won games 47 and 48 fide president  unilaterally terminated the match citing the health of the playershttp  wwwmark weekscom chess 84kkhtm 1984 karpov–kasparov title match highlights mark weeks chess pages  the match had lasted an unprecedented five months with five wins for karpov three for kasparov and forty draws
a rematch was set for later in 1985 also in moscow the events of the so called marathon match forced fide to return to the previous format a match limited to 24 games with karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 12–12 karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title but wound up losing thus surrendering the title to his opponent the final score was 13 11 +3 −5  16 in favour of kasparov
karpov remained a formidable opponent and the world #2 until the early 1990s he fought kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 held in london and  1987 held in  and 1990 held in new york city and  all three matches were extremely close the scores were 11½ to 12½ +4 −5  15 12 to 12 +4 −4  16 and 11½ to 12½ +3 −4  17 in all three matches karpov had winning chances up to the very last games in particular the 1987 seville match featured an astonishing blunder by kasparov in the 23rd game in the final game needing only a draw to win the title karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw and allowed kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn after a further mistake in the second session karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64 ending the match and allowing kasparov to keep the title
in their five world championship matches karpov scored 19 wins 21 losses and 104 draws in 144 games
karpov is on record saying that if he had the opportunity to play fischer for the crown in his twenties he could have been a much better player as a result

the aspect ratio of a   is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions for example the aspect ratio of a  is the  of its longer side to its shorter side   the ratio of width to height  when the rectangle is oriented as a landscape
the aspect ratio is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon xy the values x and y do not represent actual width and height but rather the relation between width and height as an example 85 1610 and 161 are the same aspect ratio
in objects of more than two dimensions such as s the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side
the term is most commonly used with erence to

 the diameter width aspect ratio dwar of a compact set is the ratio of its diameter to its width a circle has the minimal dwar which is 1 a square has a dwar of sqrt2 
 the cube volume aspect ratio cvar of a compact set is the d th root of the ratio of the d volume of the smallest enclosing axes parallel d cube to the sets own d volume a square has the minimal cvar which is 1 a circle has a cvar of sqrt2 an axis parallel rectangle of width w and height h where wh has a cvar of sqrtw^2 wh   sqrtw h
if the dimension d is fixed then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors
aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as xy pronounced x to y and x×y pronounced x by y with the latter particularly used for  such as 640×480
cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a rounded decimal multiple of width vs unit height while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height in s there is a subtle distinction between the display aspect ratio the image as displayed and the  the ratio of pixel dimensions see

there are other categories of single seater racing including  which employs a small low cost machine on small tracks many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts  represents the most popular first open wheel category for up and coming drivers stepping up from karts the series is still the perred option as it has introduced an aero package and slicks allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer f1 the  is another entry level series

rothbards defense of the self ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives namely that either a group of people can own another group of people or the other alternative that no single person has full ownership over ones self rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a  ie a just natural law that can govern all people independent of place and time the only alternative that remains to rothbard is self ownership which he believes is both axiomatic and universal name rothbard 19822rothbard murray n 1982 https  wwwmisesorg rothbard ethics ethicsasp the ethics of liberty humanities press isbn 978 0 8147 7506 6 p 162 retrieved 20 may 2005

this is the root of anarcho capitalist  and where they differ from  forms of anarchism such as  where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed according to need which is to be determined and enforced collectively anarcho capitalists advocate individual or joint ie private ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual needs or does not need as rothbard says if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive then he has the right to own the product that he has made after property is transformed through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift forced transfers are considered illegitimate original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never before used resources including land and by improving or otherwise using it own it with the same absolute right as his own body according to rothbard property can only come about through labor theore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it it is only by using landampnbsp– by mixing ones labor with itampnbsp– that original appropriation is legitimized any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the persons property for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource it remains his owned land his labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land and the land is theore his or his assigns in perpetuity name rothbard 1962rothbard murray n 1962 https  wwwmisesorg rothbard mes chap2dasp ludwig von mises institute  with   isbn 978 0 945466 30 7 ch 2 retrieved 19 may 2005  as a practical matter in terms of the ownership of land anarcho capitalists recognize that there are few if any parcels of land left on earth whose ownership was not at some point in time obtained in violation of the homestead principle through seizure by the state or put in private hands with the assistance of the state rothbard says
rothbard says in justice and property right that any identifiable owner the original victim of theft or his heir must be accorded his property in the case of slavery rothbard says that in many cases the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified and the reparations can become highly specific indeed he believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the homestead principle if property is held by the state rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector any property in the hands of the state is in the hands of thieves and should be liberated as quickly as possible for example he proposes that  be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally private property if it is the result of state initiated force such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies he proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers he says what we libertarians object to then is not government per se but crime what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles what we are for is not private property per se but just innocent non criminal private property likewise karl hess says libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend willy nilly all property which now is called private much of that property is stolen much is of dubious title all of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral coercive state systemhess karl 1969 https  misesorg journals lf 1969 1969_06_15pdf letter from washington the libertatian forum vol i no vi 15 june 1969 retrieved 5 august 2006  by accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights anarcho capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle
 
though anarcho capitalists assert a right to private property some anarcho capitalists also point out that common ie community property can exist by right in an anarcho capitalist system just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own this may apply to roads parks rivers and portions of oceans name holcombeholcombe randall g https  misesorg journals jls 19_2 19_2_1pdf common property in anarcho capitalism journal of libertarian studies volume 19 no 2 spring 20053–29  anarchist theorist  gives the following example

the society envisioned by anarcho capitalists has been called the contractual societyampnbsp–  a society based purely on voluntary action entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence name rothbard 1962 ampnbsp– in which anarcho capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements contracts between individuals as the legal framework it is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts
one particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties no external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction an employer might offer insurance and  to  another might use to recognize any union outside his or her own faith individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit
rothbard points out that corporations would exist in a free society as they are simply the pooling of capital he says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital on the purely free market such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation name rothbard 1962

anarcho capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty ie courts military or police forces insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis but their complaint is not just that the states defensive services are funded by taxation but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force that is it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security such as a police judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors anarcho capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it but not private individuals a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors also if competition in security provision were allowed to exist prices would be lower and services would be better according to anarcho capitalists according to molinari under a regime of liberty the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries name molinari 1849molinari gustave de 1849 http  praxeologynet gm pshtm the production of security trans j huston mcculloch retrieved 15 july 2006   proponents point out that private systems of justice and defense already exist naturally forming where the market is allowed to compensate for the failure of the state private arbitration security guards neighborhood watch groups and so on name stringham 53  name stringham 52  name stringham 51  name friedman 1973 1973  harper amp row isbn 978 0 06 091010 5 http  wwwdaviddfriedmancom libertarian machinery_of_freedom moff_chapter_29html ch29   these private courts and police are sometimes erred to generically as private defense agencies pdas

the two principal moral approaches to anarcho capitalism differ in regard to whether anarcho capitalist society is justified on  or  ethics or both natural law anarcho capitalism as advocated by rothbard holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law some other anarcho capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights but instead present economic justifications for a free market capitalist society such a latter approach has been offered by david d friedman in  name tame chris r 1983 p 56tame chris r october 1983 the chicago school lessons from the thirties for the eighties economic affairs p 56  also unlike other anarcho capitalists most notably rothbard friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on  but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions see  to compare the net result nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a  benchmark name friedman 1973 
kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since in the absence of statutory law the  nap is naturally enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace for him the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form name libertarianpapers

murray rothbard argues that the capitalist system of today is indeed not properly anarchistic because it so often colludes with the state according to rothbard what marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term these two contradictory concepts are what i would call free market capitalism on the one hand and state capitalism on the other name fpcrothbard murray n 1973 https  wwwmisesorg articleaspxid 1559 a future of peace and capitalism james h weaver ed modern political economy boston allyn and bacon pp 419–30  the difference between free market capitalism and state capitalism writes rothbard is precisely the difference between on the one hand peaceful voluntary exchange and on the other violent expropriation he continues state capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble name fpc 
rothbard maintains that anarcho capitalism is the only true form of anarchism—the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he argues any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology such as redistribution of private propertyrothbard murray n 25 february 1972 http  wwwlewrockwellcom rothbard rothbard103html exclusive interview with murray rothbard the new banner a fortnightly libertarian journal  according to this argument the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society cooperatives non profit organizations businesses etc moreover anarcho capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of left wing anarchist ideals would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people this body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state the difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively egalitarian anarchist system name tame chris r 1983 p 56 
however rothbard also wrote a piece published posthumously entitled are libertarians anarchists where he traced the etymological roots of anarchist philosophy ultimately coming to the conclusion that we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists and theore at opposite poles from our position that none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines and furthermore we must theore conclude that we are not anarchists and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground and are being completely unhistorical on the other hand it is clear that we are not archists either we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive perhaps then we could call ourselves by a new name nonarchist

rothbard disagreed with this as he explains in the spooner tucker doctrine an economists view he says that first of all tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self regulating if it were not then inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place secondly he says that tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated also tucker held a labor theory of value as a result he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or usury was taking place as he explains in state socialism and anarchism his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses which would in turn raise demand for labor this led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay again as a neoclassical economist rothbard did not agree with the labor theory he believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to  rather than to labor amounts in free market and he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces
 opposed vast concentrations of wealth which he believed were made possible by government intervention and state protected monopolies he believed the most dangerous state intervention was the requirement that individuals obtain charters in order to operate banks and what he believed to be the illegality of issuing private money which he believed caused capital to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few which he called the banking monopoly he believed anyone should be able to engage in banking that wished without requiring state permission and issue private money though he was supporter of laissez faire late in life he said that state intervention had allowed some extreme concentrations of resources to such a degree that even if laissez faire were instituted it would be too late for competition to be able to release those resources he gave standard oil as an exampletucker benjamin http  flagblackenednet daver anarchism tucker tucker2html state socialism and anarchism  anarcho capitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking they like all  economists believe that monopolization is facilitated and expanded through government intervention 19th century american individualist anarchists such as tucker and lysander spooner have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economy
of particular importance to anarcho capitalists and tucker and spooner are the ideas of sovereignty of the individual a market economy and the opposition to collectivism a defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the state tucker said defense is a service like any other service that it is labor both useful and desired and theore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production that competition prevailing patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the state and that the state like almost all monopolists charges exorbitant pricestucker benjamin instead of a book 1893

it has been argued that aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitionsaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians the clouds ah sommerstein ed  1975 page9 footnote  his plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of athens the  and  where they were judged and awarded prizes in competition with the works of other comic dramatists an elaborate series of lotteries designed to prevent prejudice and corruption reduced the voting judges at the city dionysia to just five in number these judges probably lected the mood of the audiencesbarrett 1964 p26  yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiencesbarrett 1964 p25  the theatres were certainly huge with seating for at least 10ampnbsp000 at the theatre of dionysus the days program at the city dionysia for example was crowded with three tragedies and a  play ahead of a comedy but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens typically the main supporters of  like cleon occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits the conservative views expressed in the plays might theore lect the attitudes of the dominant group in an unrepresentative audience 
the production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays throughout most of aristophanes career the chorus was essential to a plays success and it was recruited and funded by a  a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the s a choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the chorus as a civic duty and a public honour but aristophanes showed in  that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like cleonaristophanis comoediae tomus 1 fwhall and wmgeldart eds oxford classical texts the knights lines 911 25  thus the political conservatism of the plays may lect the views of the wealthiest section of athenian society on whose generosity all dramatists depended for putting on their playswrennie the acharnians of aristophanes  london 1909 page 7 reproduced by bibliolife

the language of aristophanes plays and in old comedy generally was valued by ancient commentators as a model of the  the orator  believed that the charm and grandeur of the attic dialect made old comedy an example for orators to study and follow and he considered it inferior in these respects only to the works of homer name oratorsthe orators training quintilian 10165 6 cited in barrett 2003 p15 quintilian 10165 6 http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts quintilian institutio_oratoria 10ahtml#161 10161  a revival of interest in the attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of aristophanes plays during the 4th and 5th centuries ad resulting in their survival today name orators   in aristophanes plays the attic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualities
for aristophanes contemporaries the works of  and  formed the cornerstones of hellenic history and culture thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satirebarrett 1964 pp 151 52  aristophanes was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous erences to other poets these include not only rival comic dramatists such as  and aristophanis comoediae tomus 1 fwhall and wmgeldart eds oxford classical texts clouds lines 553 54  and predecessors such as   and aristophanis comoediae tomus 1 fw hall and wm geldart eds oxford classical texts knights lines 519 40  but also tragedians notably   and  all three of whom are mentioned in eg the frogs aristophanes was the equal of these great tragedians in his subtle use of lyricsbarrett 1964 p30  he appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of euripides in particular so much so that the comic dramatist  labelled him a euripidaristophanist addicted to hair splitting niceties name barrett 2003 p9 
a full appreciation of aristophanes plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill and of their different rhythms and associationsmacdowell 1978 p21  there were three broad poetic forms iambic dialogue tetrameter verses and lyricsbarrett 2003 pp7 8 
 iambic dialogue aristophanes achieves an effect resembling natural speech through the use of the  corresponding to the effects achieved by english poets such as shakespeare using iambic pentameters his realistic use of the metre name other plays 2003 page 27 macdowell 1978 p16  makes it ideal for both dialogue and soliloquy as for instance in the prologue before the arrival of the chorus when the audience is introduced to the main issues in the plot the acharnians opens with these three lines by the hero dikaiopolis rendered here in english as iambic pentameters

 tetrameter catalectic verses these are long lines of   or iambs where each line is ideally measured in four dipodes or pairs of feet used in various situations within each play such as
 formal debates or agons between characters typically in anapestic rhythm
 excited dialogue or heated argument typically trochaic rhythm the same as in early tragedy
 long speeches declaimed by the chorus in  in either anapestic or trochaic rhythms
 informal debates barely above the level of ordinary dialogue typically iambic
anapestic rhythms are naturally jaunty as in many s and trochaic metre is suited to rapid delivery the word trochee is in fact derived from trechein to run as demonstrated for example by choruses who enter at speed often in aggressive moodlpe parker the songs of aristophanes oxford 1997 p 36  however even though both these rhythms can seem to bowl along name other plays 2003 page 27barrett 2003 p27  aristophanes often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted metres adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument in an anapestic passage in the frogs for instance the character aeschylus presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god dionysus

the rhythm begins at a typical anapestic gallop slows down to consider the revered poets hesiod and homer then gallops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate pantocles such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audiences appetite for the next joke
 lyrics almost nothing is known about the music that accompanied greek lyrics and the metre is often so varied and complex that it is difficult for modern readers or audiences to get a feel for the intended effects yet aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity of his lyrics name other plays 2003 page 27  some of the most memorable and haunting lyrics are dignified hymns set free of the comic actiongreek drama peter levi in the oxford history of the classical world edited by j boardman j griffin and o murray oxford university press 1986 page 175  in the example below taken from the wasps the lyric is merely a comic interlude and the rhythm is steadily trochaic the syntax in the original greek is natural and unforced and it was probably accompanied by brisk and cheerful music gliding to a concluding pun at the expense of amynias who is thought to have lost his fortune gambling name macdowell1978p27macdowell 1978 p27

the pun here in english translation penestes penniless is a weak version of the greek   penéstaisi penéstĕs destitute many of the puns in the plays are based on words that are similar rather than identical and it has been observed that there could be more of them than scholars have yet been able to identifybarrett 2003 p21  others are based on double meanings sometimes entire scenes are constructed on puns as in the acharnians with the  farmer and his pigsthe acharnians http  elwikisourceorg wiki %ce%91%cf%87%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%bd%ce%b5%ce%af%cf%82 wikisource original greek lines 729 835  the megarian farmer defies the athenian embargo against megarian trade and tries to trade his daughters disguised as pigs except pig was ancient slang for vagina since the  was the pretext for the peloponnesian war aristophanes naturally concludes that this whole mess happened because of three cunts
it can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery particularly the use of similes metaphors and pictorial expressions name macdowell 1978 p17  in the knights for example the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as parasols that open and closearistophanis comoediae tomus 1 fw hall and wm geldart eds oxford classical texts knights lines 1347 48  in the frogs  is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sandpitthe frogs lines 902 4  some plays feature revelations of human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious in character such as the marriage of the hero pisthetairos to s paramour in the birds and the recreation of old athens crowned with roses at the end of the knights
it is widely believed that aristophanes condemned rhetoric on both moral and political grounds he states “a speaker trained in the new rhetoric may use his talents to deceive the jury and bewilder his opponents so thoroughly that the trial loses all semblance of fairness” name murphy charles t 1938murphy charles t aristophanes and the art of rhetoric harvard studies in classic philology 49 1938 69 113 web 28 sept 2014 
 he is speaking to the “art” of flattery and evidence points towards the fact that many of aristophanes’ plays were actually created with the intent to attack the view of rhetoric the most noticeable attack can be seen in his play banqueters in which two brothers from different educational backgrounds argue over which education is better one brother comes from a background of “old fashioned” education while the other brother appears to be a product of the sophistic education  name murphy charles t 1938 
           
the chorus was mainly used by aristophanes as a defense against rhetoric and would often talk about topics such as the civic duty of those who were educated in classical teachings in aristophanes’ opinion it was the job of those educated adults to protect the public from the deception and to stand as a beacon of light for those who were more gullible than others one of the main reasons why aristophanes was so against the sophists came into existence from the requirements listed by the leaders of the organization money was essential which meant that roughly all of the pupils studying with the sophists came from upper class backgrounds and excluded the rest of the polis aristophanes believed that education and knowledge was a public service and that anything that excluded willing minds was nothing but an abominationmajor wilfred e aristophanes enemy of rhetoric np np 1996 print  he concludes that all politicians that study rhetoric must have doubtful citizenships unspeakable morals and too much arrogance” name murphy charles t 1938

for convenience old comedy as represented by aristophanes early plays is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristicsampnbsp— topicality festivity and complexity dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of aristophanes plays however it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to english translations and it is theore treated in a separate section
old comedys emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentariesampnbsp— see for example articles on   and  for lists of topical erences the topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient athens
 individual masks all actors in  wore masks but whereas in tragedy and new comedy these identified stereotypical characters in old comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people perhaps socrates attracted a lot of attention in old comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by mask makersaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians clouds a sommerstein penguin classics 1975 page 31  in the knights we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of cleon there represented as a paphlagonian slave but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anywayknights lines 230 33 
 the real scene of action since old comedy makes numerous erences to people in the audience the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke in the acharnians for example the  is just a few steps from the heros front door and in peace olympia is separated from athens by a few moments supposed flight on a dung beetle the audience is sometimes drawn or even dragged into the action when the hero in peace returns to athens from his flight to olympia he tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the heavens and seen up close they look even worsepeace 821 23  in the acharnians the hero confronts the the acharnians http  elwikisourceorg wiki %ce%91%cf%87%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%bd%ce%b5%ce%af%cf%82 wikisource original greek lines 1224 25  sitting in the front row and demands to be awarded first prize for a drinking competition which is a none too subtle way for aristophanes to request first prize for the drama competition
 self mocking theatre frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of old comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand but the lenaia and city dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies and thus erences to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audiencegreek drama peter levi in the oxford history of the classical world jboardman j griffin and o murray eds oxford university press 1986 page 176  the comic dramatist also poked fun at comic poets and he even ridiculed himself it is possible as indicated earlier that aristophanes mocked his own baldness in the clouds the chorus compares him to an unwed young motherclouds lines 528 33  and in the acharnians the chorus mockingly depicts him as athens greatest weapon in the war against spartaacharnians lines 646 51 
 political theatre the lenaia and city dionysus were state sponsored religious festivals and though the latter was the more prestigious of the two both were occasions for official pomp and circumstance the ceremonies for the lenaia were overseen by the  and by officials of the  the city dionysia was overseen by the  and the priest of dionysus opening ceremonies for the city dionysia featured in addition to the ceremonial arrival of the god a parade in full armour of the sons of warriors who died fighting for the polis and until the end of the peloponnesian war a presentation of annual tribute from subject statesaristophaneslysistrata the acharnians the clouds asommerstein penguin classics 1973 pages 18 19  religious and political issues were topics that could hardly be ignored in such a setting and the plays often treat them quite seriously even jokes can be serious when the topic is politicsampnbsp— especially in wartime the butts of the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey on the gullibility of their fellow citizens including oracle mongerseg knights lines 997 1095 birds lines 959 91  the exponents of new religious practiceseg clouds lines 263 66 frogs lines 891 94  war profiteers and political fanatics in the acharnians for example  is represented as a crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared to the heros preparations for a dinner partyacharnians lines 1097 1142 lines   emerges from numerous similes and metaphors in the knights as a protean form of comic evil clinging to political power by every possible means for as long as he can yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking poseidon and athenaknights lines 551 64 and 581 594  and it ends with visions of a miraculously transformed demos ie the morally ormed citizenry of athensknights lines 1321 38  imaginative visions of a return to peaceful activities resulting from peace with spartaeg peace lines 551 97  and a plea for leniency for citizens suspected of complicity in an oligarchic revoltfrogs lines 686 705  are other examples of a serious purpose behind the plays
 teasing and taunting a festival audience presented the comic dramatist with a wide range of targets not just political or religious onesampnbsp— anyone known to the audience could be mocked for any reason such as diseases physical deformities ugliness family misfortunes bad manners perversions dishonesty cowardice in battle and clumsinessaristophanes clouds kj dover ed oxford university press 1970 pages xiii xiv  foreigners a conspicuous presence in imperial athens particularly at the city dionysia often appear in the plays comically mispronouncing attic wordsampnbsp— these include spartans lysistrata scythians thesmophoriazusae persians boeotians and megarians the acharnians

 dirty jokes a relaxation in standards of behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and godsgreek drama peter levi in the oxford history of the classical world oxford university press 1986 page 175  old comedy is rich in obscenities and the crude jokes are often very detailed and difficult to understand without expert commentary as when the chorus in the acharnians places a curse on antimachushttp  elwikisourceorg wiki %ce%91%cf%87%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%bd%ce%b5%ce%af%cf%82 the acharnians wikisource original greek lines 1164 73  a choregus accused of niggardly conduct wishing upon him a night time mugging as he returns home from some drunken party and envisioning him as he stoops down to pick up a rock in the darkness accidentally picking up a fresh turd instead he is then envisioned hurling the turd at his attacker missing and accidentally hitting cratinus a lyric poet not admired by aristophanesaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians the clouds a sommerstein penguin classics pages 243 4 notes 698081  this was particularly funny because the curse was sung or chanted in choreographed style by a chorus of 24 grown men who were otherwise known to the audience as respectable citizens
 the musical extravaganza the chorus was vital to the success of a play in old comedy long after it had lost its relevance for tragedyaristophanes the frogs and other plays david barrett penguin classics 1964 pages 14 15  technically the competition in the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between chorusesaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians the clouds a sommerstein penguin classics page 23  in fact eight of aristophanes eleven surviving plays are named after the chorus in aristophanes time the chorus in tragedy was relatively small twelve members and its role had been reduced to that of an awkwardly placed commentator but in old comedy the chorus was large numbering 24 it was actively involved in the plot its entry into the action was frequently spectacular its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes it was involved in choreographed skirmishes with the actorsthe acharnians lines 280 301 http  elwikisourceorg wiki %ce%91%cf%87%ce%b1%cf%81%ce%bd%ce%b5%ce%af%cf%82 wikisource original greek knights lines 247 72 wasps lines 452 460 http  elwikisourceorg wiki %ce%a3%cf%86%ce%ae%ce%ba%ce%b5%cf%82 wikisource original greek   the expenditure on costumes training and maintenance of a chorus was considerablearistophanes the frogs and other plays david barrett penguin classics 1964 page 9  and perhaps many people in the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and musicaristophanes wasps douglas macdowell ed oxford university press 1978 page 14 15  the chorus gradually lost its significance as new comedy began to develop
 obvious costumes consistent with the holiday spirit much of the humour in old comedy is slapstick buffoonery and dirty jokes that do not require the audiences caul attention often relying on visual cues actors playing male roles appear to have worn tights over grotesque padding with a prodigious leather phallus barely concealed by a short tunic female characters were played by men but were easily recognized in long saffron tunicsaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians the clouds a sommerstein penguin classics page 29  sometimes the visual cues are deliberately confused for comic effect as in the frogs where dionysus arrives on stage in a saffron tunic the buskin boots of a tragic actor and a lion skin cloak that usually characterized    an absurd outfit that provokes the character heracles as no doubt it provoked the audience to guffaws of helpless mirthfrogs lines 45 47 
 the farcical anti climax the holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences the major confrontation agon between the good and bad characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play the rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes the farcical anti climax has been explained in a variety of ways depending on the particular play in the wasps for instance it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main characters perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbedaristophanes wasps douglas macdowell oxford university press 1978 page 7  in the acharnians it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdomaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians the clouds a sommerstein penguin classics pages 33 34  but the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in old comedyaristophanes old and new comedy kenneth jreckford unc press 1987 page 15  and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle the music jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play the celebration of the heros victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closurearistophanes the frogs and other plays david barrett penguin classics 1964 pages 13 14 
the development of new comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tonearistophanes d slavitt and p bovie eds university of pennsylvania press 1999 page xiii  old comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour even to the point of undermining the humour itselfaristophanes and the definition of comedy mssilk oxford university press 2002 page 418 
 inclusive comedy old comedy provided a variety of entertainments for a diverse audience it accommodated a serious purpose light entertainment hauntingly beautiful lyrics the buffoonery of puns and invented words obscenities disciplined verse wildly absurd plots and a formal dramatic structure
 fantasy and absurdity fantasy in old comedy is unrestricted and impossibilities are ignoredaristophanes clouds kjdover oxford university press 1970 page xiii  situations are developed logically to absurd conclusions an approach to humour that is echoed for instance in the works of  and  the aristophanes wasps douglas macdowell oxford university press 1978 page 12  the crazy costume worn by dionysus in the frogs is typical of an absurd result obtained on logical groundsampnbsp— he wears a womans saffron coloured tunic because effeminacy is an aspect of his divinity buskin boots because he is interested in reviving the art of tragedy and a lion skin cape because like heracles his mission leads him into  absurdities develop logically from initial premises in a plot in the knights for instance cleons corrupt service to the people of athens is originally depicted as a household relationship in which the slave dupes his master the introduction of a rival who is not a member of the household leads to an absurd shift in the metaphor so that cleon and his rival become  competing for the affections of an  hawkers of oracles competing for the attention of a credulous public athletes in a race for approval and orators competing for the popular vote
 the resourceful hero in aristophanic comedy the hero is an independent minded and self reliant individual he has something of the ingenuity of homers  and much of the shrewdness of the farmer idealized in s  subjected to corrupt leaders and unreliable neighbours typically he devises a complicated and highly fanciful escape from an intolerable situationclouds peter meineck translator and ian storey introduction hackett publishing 2000 page viii  thus dikaiopolis in the acharnians contrives a private peace treaty with the spartans bdelucleon in the wasps turns his own house into a private law court in order to keep his jury addicted father safely at home trygaeus in peace flies to olympus on a giant dung beetle to obtain an end to the peloponnesian war pisthetairus in birds sets off to establish his own colony and becomes instead the ruler of the bird kingdom and a rival to the gods
 the resourceful cast the numerous surprising developments in an aristophanic plot the changes in scene and the farcical comings and goings of minor characters towards the end of a play were managed according to theatrical convention with only three principal actors a fourth actor often the leader of the chorus was permitted to deliver short speechesaristophanes the frogs and other plays david barrett ed penguin classics 1964 page 17  songs and addresses to the audience by the chorus gave the actors hardly enough time off stage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scene
 complex structure the action of an aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another the different structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in english translations
the structural elements of a typical aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows
 prologue   an introductory scene with a dialogue and or soliloquy addressed to the audience expressed in  and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the play
 parodos   the arrival of the chorus dancing and singing sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors often expressed in long lines of tetrameters
 symmetrical scenes   passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenes
 parabasis   verses through which the chorus addresses the audience directly firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end see the section below 
 agon   a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play typically in anapestic tetrameter though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior argumentsaristophaneswasps d macdowell ed oxford university press 1971 page 207 note 546 630 
 episodes   sections of dialogue in iambic trimeter often in a succession of scenes featuring minor characters towards the end of a play
 songs strophes antistrophes or odes antodes   often in symmetrical pairs where each half has the same meter and number of lines as the other used as transitions between other structural elements or between scenes while actors change costume and often commenting on the action
 exodus   the departure of the chorus and the actors in song and dance celebrating the heros victory and sometimes celebrating a symbolic marriage
the rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needsaristophanes lysistrata the acharnians the clouds a sommerstein penguin classics 1975 page 27  in the acharnians and peace for example there is no formal agon whereas in the clouds there are two agons
 
the parabasis is an address to the audience by the chorus or chorus leader while the actors leave or have left the stage in this role the chorus is sometimes out of character as the authors voice and sometimes in character although these capacities are often difficult to distinguish generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end the elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that aristophanes own understanding was less formalaristophanes wasps dougles macdowell oxford university press 1978 page 261  the selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis the early plays the acharnians to the birds are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them
 kommation this is a brief prelude comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors such as  go rejoicing
 parabasis proper this is usually a defense of the authors work and it includes criticism of the audiences attitude it is declaimed in long lines of anapestic tetrameters aristophanes himself ers to the parabasis proper only as anapests
 pnigos sometimes known as a choker it comprises a few short lines appended to the parabasis proper as a kind of rapid patter it has been suggested that some of the effects achieved in a pnigos can be heard in the lord chancellors nightmare song in act 2 of gilbert and sullivans iolanthe name aristophanes wasps douglas macdowell 1978 page 27aristophanes wasps douglas macdowell ed oxford university press 1978 page 27 
 epirrhematic syzygies these are symmetrical scenes that mirror each other in meter and number of lines they form part of the first parabasis and they often comprise the entire second parabasis they are characterized by the following elements
 strophe or ode these are lyrics in a variety of meters sung by the chorus in the first parabasis as an invocation to the gods and as a comic interlude in the second parabasis
 epirrhema these are usually long lines of trochaic tetrameters broadly political in their significance they were probably spoken by the leader of the chorus in characteraristophanes clouds kj dover ed oxford university press 1970 page 126 
 antistrophe or antode these are songs that mirror the strophe ode in meter length and function
 antepirrhema this is another declaimed passage and it mirrors the epirrhema in meter length and function
 is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approacharistophaneswasps douglas mmacdowell oxford university press 1978 note 1283 page 298  and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as follows

the tragic dramatists  and  died near the end of the peloponnesian war and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of athens and it is possible that it did so because in aristophanes it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new agegreek drama peter levi in the oxford history of the classical world j boardman j griffin and o murray eds oxford university press 1986 page 176  indeed according to one ancient source platonius c9th century ad one of aristophaness last plays aioliskon had neither a parabasis nor any choral lyrics making it a type of middle comedy while kolakos anticipated all the elements of new comedy including a rape and a recognition sceneewhandley comedy in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and b knox eds cambridge university press 1985 page 400  aristophanes seems to have had some appreciation of his formative role in the development of comedy as indicated by his comment in clouds that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his playsclouds lines 560 62  clouds was awarded third ie last place after its original performance and the text that has come down to the modern age was a subsequent draft that aristophanes intended to be read rather than actedaristophanes clouds kjdover oxford university press 1970 pages xxix xxx  the circulation of his plays in manuscript extended their influence beyond the original audience over whom in fact they seem to have had little or no practical influence they did not affect the career of  they failed to persuade the athenians to pursue an honourable peace with sparta and it is not clear that they were instrumental in the trial and execution of socrates whose death probably resulted from public animosity towards the philosophers disgraced associates such as aristophanes clouds kj dover oxford university press 1970 pages xiv xv  exacerbated of course by his own intransigence during the trialplatos apology benjamin jowett trans wikisource copy  section 33  the plays in manuscript form have been put to some surprising usesampnbsp— as indicated  they were used in the study of rhetoric on the recommendation of  and by students of the attic dialect in the fourth and fifth centuries ad it is possible that plato sent copies of the plays to dionysius of syracuse so that he might learn about athenian life and governmentclouds peter meineck translator and ian storey introduction hackett publishing 2000 page x

schweitzer a  challenged both the secular view of  current at this time in certain academic circles as well as the traditional christian view his contributions to the interpretation of pauline theology are noteworthy as they concern the role of pauls mysticism of being in christ as primary in importance to the secondary doctrine of 
he received the 1952  for his philosophy of   expressed in many ways but most famously in founding and sustaining the  in  now in  west central africa then french equatorial africa as a music scholar and organist he studied the music of german composer  and influenced the  orgelbewegung
schweitzer was born in kaysersberg the son of adele schillinger and ludwig louis schweitzer  he spent his childhood in the village of  alsace  where his father the local  pastor of the  taught him how to play music  long disputed the predominantly german speaking region of alsace or elsaß was acquired by france in 1648 with the  was reannexed by germany in 1871 after world war i it reverted to france the tiny village is home to the  aias  the medieval parish church of gunsbach was shared by the protestant and catholic congregations which held their prayers in different areas at different times on sundays this compromise arose after the  and the  schweitzer the pastors son grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance and developed the belief that true christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purposeseaver 1951 pp 3–9 
schweitzers home language was an  of german at  high school he got his  the certificate at the end of secondary education in 1893 he studied organ there from 1885 to 1893 with eugène munch organist of the protestant temple who inspired schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of german composer a schweitzer eugene munch j brinkmann mulhouse 1898  in 1893 he played for the french   at  for whom s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal widor deeply impressed agreed to teach schweitzer without fee and a great and influential friendship was begunjoy 1953 pp 23–24 
from 1893 he studied protestant theology at the  of  there he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor gustav jacobsthal and associated closely with ernest munch the brother of his former teacher organist of st william church who was also a passionate admirer of js bachs musicjoy 1953 p 24  schweitzer served his one year compulsory military service in 1894  schweitzer saw many operas of richard wagner at straßburg under  and in 1896 he pulled together the funds to visit  to see wagners  and  and was deeply affected in 1898 he went back to paris to write a phd dissertation on the religious philosophy of  at the  and to study in earnest with widor here he often met with the elderly  he also studied piano at that time with george n marshall david poling https  booksgooglecom booksid uc5sxn1cwt4camppg pa24 schweitzer jhu press 2000 isbn 0 8018 6455 0  he completed his theology degree in 1899 and published his phd thesis at the  in 1899joy 1953 pp 24–25 
schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist dedicated also to the rescue restoration and study of historic s with theological insight he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in s religious music in 1899 he astonished widor by explaining figures and motifs in bachs  as painter like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based they were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas conceived visually widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old  hymns name   tkrsmyseaver 1951 p 20 
the exposition of these ideas encouraged by widor and munch became schweitzers next task and appeared in the masterly study j s bach le musicien poète written in french and published in 1905 there was great demand for a german edition but instead of translating it he decided to rewrite itschweitzer my life and thought pp 80–81 cf seaver 1951 pp 231–232  the result was two volumes j s bach which were published in 1908 and translated in english by  in 1911joy 1953 pp 58–62  during its preparation he became a friend of  then resident in strasbourg with whom he had many theological and musical conversations exploring his view of bachs descriptive music and playing the major chorale preludes for her at the temple neufschweitzer in joy 1953 pp 53–57  schweitzers interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of bachs music  he became a welcome guest at the wagners home joy 1953 pp 53–57 quoting from and translating a schweitzer mes souvenirs sur cosima wagner in lalsace française xxxv no 7 12 february 1933 p 124 ff  he also corresponded with composer  and the two became good friends 
his pamphlet the art of organ building and organ playing in germany and france 1906reproduced in joy 1953 pp 127–129 129–165 cf also seaver 1951 pp 29–36  republished with an appendix on the state of the organ building industry in 1927 effectively launched the 20th century  which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles—although this sweeping orm movement in organ building eventually went further than schweitzer himself had intended in 1909 he addressed the third congress of the international society of music at  on the subject  having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ builders in several european countries he produced a very considered reportjoy 1953 pp 165–166 text of 1909 questionnaire and report pp 235–269  this provided the basis for the international regulations for organ building  he envisaged instruments in which the french late romantic full organ sound should work integrally with the english and german romantic s and with the classical alsace  organ resources and baroque s all in registers regulated by  to access distinct voices in  or  capable of combination without loss of distinctness different voices singing together in the same music
schweitzer also studied piano under  head of the piano department at the 
in 1905 widor and schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the  a choir dedicated to performing js bachs music for whose concerts schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913 he was also appointed organist for the bach concerts of the orféo català at  and often travelled there for that purpose name   tkrsmy  he and widor collaborated on a new edition of bachs  with detailed analysis of each work in three languages english french german  schweitzer who insisted that the score should show bachs notation with no additional markings wrote the commentaries for the preludes and fugues and widor those for the sonatas and concertos six volumes were published in 1912–14 three more to contain the chorale preludes with schweitzers analyses were to be worked on in africa but these were never completed perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thoughtseaver 1951 p 44 
on departure for lambaréné in 1913 he was presented with a  a piano with pedal attachments to operate like an organ pedal keyboardgiven by the paris bach society seaver 1951 p 63 but joy 1953 p 177 says it was given by the paris missionary society  built especially for the tropics it was delivered by river in a huge dug out canoe to lambaréné packed in a zinc lined case at first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art and fell out of practice but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of bach    and  systematicallyseaver 1951 pp 63–64  it became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on sunday afternoons schweitzers pedal piano was still in use at lambaréné in 1946joy 1953 plate facing p 177  and according to a visitor dr gaine cannon of balsam grove nc the old dilapidated piano organ was still being played by dr schweitzer in 1962 and stories told that his fingers were still lively on the old instrument at 88 years of age
sir  dedicated his conjectural completion of bachs die kunst der fuge  to schweitzer
schweitzers recordings of organ music and his innovative recording technique are described separately below
one of his notable pupils was conductor and composer 
in 1899 schweitzer became a deacon at the  in  in 1900 with the completion of his licentiate in theology he was ordained as curate and that year he witnessed the  in the following year he became provisional principal of the theological college of  from which he had just graduated and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent
in 1906 he published geschichte der leben jesu forschung history of life of jesus research this book which established his reputation was first translated into english by  and published in 1910 as  under this title the book became famous in the english speaking world a second german edition was published in 1913 containing theologically significant revisions and expansions but this revised edition did not appear in english until 2001  later in 1931 he published mystik des apostels paulus the mysticism of paul the apostle which was also translated into english by  a second edition was published in 1953 followed by a republished copy by the johns hopkins university press with the addition of a foreword by  in 1998
in the quest schweitzer reviewed all former work on the historical jesus back to the late 18th century he showed that the image of jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous centurys findings he maintained that the life of jesus must be interpreted in the light of jesus own convictions which lected late jewish  schweitzer writes
the fact that christianity started as a jewish apocalyptic movement is evidenced by the teachings of the historical jesus concerning the end of days not only did he preach he would rise from the grave but that he would also ascend to the heaven and one day return to judge and rule over the world saying that no one including himself knew the exact time of his return but it would be before the end of his generation schweitzer verified the many new testament erences clearly explaining that 1st century christians believed in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the worlds ending within the lifetime of jesuss original followers  he noted that in the gospel of mark jesus speaks of a tribulation with his coming in the clouds with great power and glory st mark and states when it will happen this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled st matthew 2434 or have taken place luke 2132
in the quest of the historical jesus schweitzer observes the bible contradicting the possibility of important events that never took place and never can take place as they are described jesus specifically states that we are to not seal up the words of the prophecy and promises that some of his listeners as well as the high priest at his trial would be alive to see him return to the earth blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it for the time is near revelation 13 saint paul spoke of the last times brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none 1 corinthians 729 god hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son hebrews 12 there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom matthew 1628 or until they see that the kingdom of god has come with power mark 91 or till they see the kingdom of god luke 927
schweitzer continues writing in the quest of the historical jesus that it is totally unreasonable to think that coming quickly near and soon could mean hundreds of years much less thousands of years in the future  blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it for the time is near revelation 13  and he said to me these words are faithful and true and the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bond servants the things which must soon take place and behold i am coming quickly blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book and he said to me do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book for the time is near revelation 226 7 10 12 all these things shall come upon this generation matthew 2336 schweitzer concludes that the 1st century theology originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed jesus is totally incompatible with modern christian belief
in the quest of the historical jesus schweitzer notes the  passage blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it for the time is near revelation 13 similarly in st peter christ  who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you 1 peter 120 and but the end of all things is at hand 1 peter 47 surely i come quickly revelation 2220 again note nt wright ibid  schweitzer felt that st paul clearly believed in the immediacy of the second coming of jesus in stark contrast to modern organized christianity
in the mysticism of paul the apostle schweitzer first distinguishes between two categories of  primitive and developed  primitive mysticism has not yet risen to a conception of the universal and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super earthly temporal and eternal additionally he argues that this view of a union with the divinity brought about by efficacious ceremonies is found even in quite primitive religions
on the other hand a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the greek mystery cults that were popular in 1st ce society these included the cults of   and  a developed form of mysticism is attained when the conception of the universal is reached and a man lects upon his relation to the totality of being and to being in itself schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found among the s and in the  in  in  in   and 
next schweitzer poses the question of what precise kind then is the mysticism of paul he locates paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism paul stands high above primitive mysticism due to his intellectual writings but never speaks of being one with god or being in god  instead he conceives of  to god as mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with christ  he summarizes pauline mysticism as being in christ rather than being in god
paul’s imminent  from his background in  causes him to believe that the kingdom of god has not yet come and that christians are now living in the time of christ christ mysticism holds the field until god mysticism becomes possible which is in the near future  theore schweitzer argues that paul is the only theologian who does not claim that christians can have an experience of being in god  rather paul uses the phrase being in christ to illustrate how jesus is a mediator between the christian community and god additionally schweitzer explains how the experience of being in christ is not a static partaking in the spiritual being of christ but as the real co experiencing of his dying and rising again  the realistic partaking in the mystery of jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the christian community
one of schweitzers major arguments in the mysticism of paul the apostle is that pauls mysticism marked by his phrase being in christ gives the clue to the whole of pauline theology rather than reading  as the main topic of pauline thought which has been the most popular argument set forward by  schweitzer argues that pauls emphasis was on the mystical union with god by being in christ  in his forward to the mysticism of paul the apostle points out that
 
schweitzer contrasts paul’s realistic dying and rising with christ to the symbolism of  although paul is widely influenced by hellenistic thought he is not controlled by it schweitzer explains that paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the realistic dying and rising with christ rather than the symbolic hellenistic act of becoming like christ through   after baptism the christian is continually renewed throughout his or her lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with christ most notably through the  on the other hand the hellenist lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience
another major difference between pauls realism and hellenistic symbolism is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that paul’s thought follows  lines  he explains only the man who is  thereto can enter into relation with god  although every human being is invited to become a christian only those who have undergone the initiation into the christian community through  can share in the realistic dying and rising with christ
at the age of 30 in 1905 schweitzer answered the call of the society of the evangelist missions of paris which was looking for a  however the committee of this french missionary society was not ready to accept his offer considering his lutheran theology to be incorrect   wouldnt the fact that schweitzer wasnt a physician be an equally likely reason   seaver 1951 p 40  he could easily have obtained a place in a german evangelical mission but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties amid a hail of protests from his friends family and colleagues he resigned his post and re entered the university as a student in a three year course towards the degree of a doctorate in medicine a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude he planned to spread the gospel by the example of his christian labor of healing rather than through the verbal process of preaching and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of christian teaching
even in his study of medicine and through his clinical course schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher scientist by extreme application and hard work he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911 his medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical jesus the psychiatric study of jesus in june 1912 he married  municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the jewish pan germanist historian  name   marxsenmarxsen patti m helene schweitzer a life of her own first edition syracuse new york syracuse university press 2015 
in 1912 now armed with a medical degree schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the paris missionary societys mission at  on the  river in what is now  in africa then a french colony he used to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted through concerts and other fund raising he was ready to equip a small hospitalfrom the primeval forest chapter 1  in spring 1913 he and his wife set off to establish a hospital  near an already existing mission post the site was nearly 200 miles 14 days by raftfrom the primeval forest chapter 6  upstream from the mouth of the ogooué at   and so accessible to external communications but downstream of most tributaries so that internal communications within gabon converged towards lambaréné
in the first nine months he and his wife had about 2000 patients to examine some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him in addition to injuries he was often treating severe  and crawcraw sores  yaws tropical  heart disease tropical  tropical    fevers strangulated   abdominal tumours and chronic  and  while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings  and fear of  among the 
schweitzers wife helene schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations after briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron with two 13 foot rooms consulting room and operating theatre and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves the waiting room and dormitory 42 by 20 feet were built like native huts of unhewn logs along a 30 yard path leading from the hospital to the landing place the schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant joseph a french speaking   who first came as a patient from the primeval forest chapters 3–5 
when world war i broke out in summer of 1914 schweitzer and his wife germans in a french colony were put under supervision at lambaréné by the french military where schweitzer continued his workhttp  wwwschweitzerorg german as asdbiohtm albert schweitzer 1875 – 1965 schweitzerorg in german  in 1917 exhausted by over four years work and by tropical  they were taken to  and interned first in  and then from march 1918 in  in july 1918 after being transferred to his home in alsace he was a free man again at this time schweitzer born a german citizen had his parents former pre 1871 french citizenship reinstated and became a french citizen then working as medical assistant and assistant pastor in strasbourg he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization which had occupied his mind since 1900 by 1920 his health recovering he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to gabon in 1922 he delivered the dale memorial lectures in oxford university and from these in the following year appeared volumes i and ii of his great work the decay and restoration of civilization and civilization and ethics the two remaining volumes on the world view of reverence for life  and a fourth on the civilized state were never completed
in 1924 he returned without his wife but with an oxford undergraduate  as assistant everything was heavily decayed and building and doctoring progressed together for months he now had  for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia additional medical staff nurse miss kottmann and dr victor nessmannnessmann worked with the  during the second world war was captured and executed by the  in  in 1944 cf guy penaud dictionnaire biographique de périgord p 713 isbn 978 2 86577 214 8  joined him in 1924 and dr mark lauterberg in 1925 the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies later dr trensz replaced nessmann and martha lauterberg and hans muggenstorm joined them joseph also returned in 1925 6 new hospital buildings were constructed and also a ward for white patients so that the site became like a village the onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients drug advances for sleeping sickness included  and  trensz conducted experiments showing that the non amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera  facultative anaerobic bacteria with the new hospital built and the medical team established schweitzer returned to europe in 1927 this time leaving a functioning hospital at work
he was there again from 1929 to 1932 gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged not only in europe but worldwide there was a further period of work in 1935 in january 1937 he returned again to lambaréné and continued working there throughout world war ii
schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in africa to be his response to jesus call to become fishers of men but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of european  
schweitzer was one of colonialisms harshest critics in a sermon that he preached on 6 january 1905 before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in africa he said 
schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic colonialist and racist in his attitude towards africans and in some ways his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism for instance he thought gabonese independence came too early without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances  quotes schweitzer as having said in 1960 
 has quoted schweitzer as saying the african is indeed my brother but my junior brotherchinua achebe http  socialchassncsuedu wyrick debclass achconhtm an image of africa racism in conrads heart of darknessampnbsp– the  1977 c o   which achebe criticized him for though achebe seems to acknowledge that schweitzers use of the word brother at all was for a european of the early 20th century an unusual expression of human solidarity between whites and blacks schweitzer was more likely speaking in terms of modern civilization than of class relationship of man this would be consistent with his later statement that the time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passedquoted by lachlan forrow in his foreword to the 2002 edition of african notebook  and his discussion of the modernization of primeval societies later in life he became more convinced that modern civilization was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of morality
the journalist  visited lambaréné in 1953 when schweitzer was 78 and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of schweitzer and his staff the hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities and schweitzer had little contact with the local people  cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time according to a recent bbc dramatisationon monday 7 april 2008 http  wwwbbccouk programmes b009przg the walrus and the terrierampnbsp– programme outline  broadcast an  the walrus and the terrier by christopher ralling concerning camerons visit  he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé
american journalist john gunther also visited lambaréné in the 1950s and reported schweitzers patronizing attitude towards africans he also noted the lack of africans trained to be skilled workers  after three decades in africa schweitzer still depended on europe for nurses one of those  assisted him for three years before returning to europe to work with the  during world war ii by comparison his contemporary  in uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of luganda 
the keynote of schweitzers personal philosophy which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind was the idea of  ehrfurcht vor dem leben he thought that  was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its  foundation
in the pace to civilization and ethics 1923 he argued that western philosophy from  to  had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it but no such meaning was found and the rational life affirming optimism of the  began to evaporate a rift opened between this world view as material knowledge and the life view understood as  expressed in the  philosophies from  onward scientific  advanced by  and  portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics entirely an expression of the will to live
schweitzer wrote true philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness and this may be formulated as follows i am life which wills to live and i exist in the midst of life which wills to livecivilization and ethics chapter 21 p253 reprinted as a schweitzer the philosophy of civilization  buffalo 1987 chapter 26  in nature one form of life must always prey upon another however human consciousness holds an awareness of and sympathy for the will of other beings to live an ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible
though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it the will to live constantly renews itself for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon life and love are rooted in this same principle in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself even so schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied not least in the european middle ages and in the indian ic philosophy
for schweitzer mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral it could then affirm a new enlightenment through spiritual rationalism by giving priority to  or ethical will as the primary meaning of life mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization the world view must derive from the life view not vice versa respect for life overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature in contemplation of the will to life respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanitycivilization and ethics pace and chapter ii the problem of the optimistic world view 
such was the theory which schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life according to some authors schweitzers thought and specifically his development of reverence for life was influenced by  thought and in particular the  principle of  or non violenceara paul barsam 2002 albert schweitzer jainism and reverence for life inreverence for life the ethics of albert schweitzer for the twenty first century syracuse syracuse university press isbn 978 0 8156 2977 1 pampnbsp207–08  albert schweitzer has noted the contribution of indian influence in his book indian thought and its developmentalbert schweitzer and charles rhind joy 1947 albert schweitzer an anthology beacon press

schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of bachs music known as the schweitzer technique it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid side the mid side sees a  pointed off axis perpendicular to the sound source then a single  is placed on axis bisecting the figure 8 pattern the signal from the figure 8 is mult ed panned hard left and right one of the signals being flipped out of polarity in the schweitzer method the figure 8 is replaced by two small diaphragm  pointed directly away from each other the information that each capsule collects is unique unlike the identical out of polarity information generated from the figure 8 in a regular mid side the on axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser the technique has since been used to record many modern instruments

the austrian school theorizes that the subjective choices of individuals including individual knowledge time expectation and other subjective factors cause all economic phenomena austrians seek to understand economy by examining the social ramifications of individual choice an approach called  it differs from other schools of economic thought which have focused on aggregate variables equilibrium analysis and societal groups rather than individuals name white methodology 
in the twentieth and twenty first centuries economists with a methodological lineage to the early austrian school developed many diverse approaches and theoretical orientations for example in 1949  organized his version of the subjectivist approach which he called  in a book published in english as  name ludwigvonludwig von mises nationalökonomie geneva union 1940 human action auburn ala ludwig von mises institute 1949 1998  in it mises stated that praxeology could be used to deduce a priori theoretical economic truths and that deductive economic s could yield conclusions which follow irutably from the underlying assumptions he claimed conclusions could not be inferred from empirical observation or statistical analysis and argued against the use of probabilities in economic models 
since mises time some austrian thinkers have accepted his praxeological approach while others have adopted alternative methodologiesbruce j caldwell praxeology and its critics an appraisal history of political economy fall 1984 163 363–379     for example   and others did not take mises strong  approach to economicsrichard n langlois from the knowledge of economics to the economics of knowledge fritz machlup on methodology and on the knowledge society research in the history of economic thought and methodology volume 3  1985    a radical subjectivist also largely rejected mises formulation of praxeology in favor of the verstehende methode interpretive method articulated by  name white methodology  name ludwig

austrian theory emphasizes the  of markets hayek stated that market prices lect information the totality of which is not known to any single individual which determines the allocation of resources in an economy  because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and  processes by which individuals act on their personal information  hayek argued that socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge required to make optimal decisions  those who agree with this criticism view it as a utation of socialism showing that socialism is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization the debate rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as the socialist calculation debate name schoolhttp  cepanewschooledu het essays paretian socialhtm the socialist calculation debate  
mises argued in a 1920 essay  that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the  then no prices could be obtained for s as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not objects of exchange unlike final goods theore they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently name school    this led him to write that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth name mises 
the austrian theory of the   abct focuses on banks issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations although later elaborated by hayek and others the theory was first set forth by mises who believed that banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates causing businesses to invest in relatively  production processes  mises stated that this led to a misallocation of resources which he called

the austrian school owes its name to members of the german  who argued against the austrians during the late 19th century  methodology struggle in which the austrians defended the role of theory in economics as distinct from the study or compilation of historical circumstance in 1883 menger published investigations into the method of the social sciences with special reference to economics which attacked the methods of the historical school  a leader of the historical school responded with an unfavorable review coining the term austrian school in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincialmenger’s approach – haughtily dismissed by the leader of the german historical school gustav schmoller as merely “austrian” the origin of that label – led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in europe and later in the united states  2007 in the foreword to principles of economics carl menger trns james dingwall and bert f hoselitz 1976 ludwig von mises institute alabama 2007 isbn 978 1 933550 12 1  the label endured and was adopted by the adherents themselves

mengers contributions to economic theory were closely followed by those of böhm bawerk and friedrich von wieser these three economists became what is known as the first wave of the austrian school böhm bawerk wrote extensive critiques of  in the 1880s and 1890s as was part of the austrians participation in the late 19th century  during which they attacked the  doctrines of the

by the mid 1930s most economists had embraced what they considered the important contributions of the early austrians name boettke and leeson  after  austrian economics was disregarded or derided by most economists because it rejected mathematical and statistical methods in the study of economicshttp  wwwspringerlinkcom content kq577622488v4447 fulltextpdf austrian economics and the mainstream view from the boundary by roger e backhouse 34 to view    fritz machlup quoted hayeks statement the greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought https  misesorg daily 1700 ludwig von mises a scholar who would not compromise homage to mises by fritz machlup 1981  mises student  recalled that in 1954 when kirzner was pursuing his phd there was no separate austrian school as such when kirzner was deciding which graduate school to attend mises had advised him to accept an offer of admission at johns hopkins because it was a prestigious university and fritz machlup taught there 
after 1940 austrian economics can be divided into two schools of economic thought and the school split to some degree in the late 20th century one camp of austrians exemplified by mises regards neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed the other camp exemplified by friedrich hayek accepts a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy name caplan https  misesorg journals qjae pdf qjae7_1_3pdf 
 wrote economics columns and editorials for a number of publications and wrote many books on the topic of austrian economics from the 1930s to the 1980s hazlitts thinking was influenced by mises  his book  1946 sold over a million copies and he is also known for  1959 a line by line critique of s  
the reputation of the austrian school rose in the late 20th century due in part to the work of israel kirzner and  at  and to renewed public awareness of the work of hayek after he won the 1974 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences name meijer 1995  hayeks work was influential in the revival of laissez faire thought in the 20th century name raico  
according to economist  by the late twentieth century a split had developed among those who self identify with the austrian school one group building on the work of hayek follows the broad framework of mainstream neoclassical economics including its use of mathematical models and general equilibrium and brings a critical perspective to mainstream methodology merely influenced by the austrian notions such as the  and the independent role of logical reasoning in developing economic theory name austrian search 
a second group following mises and rothbard rejects the neoclassical theories of consumer and welfare economics dismisses empirical methods and mathematical and statistical models as inapplicable to economic science and asserts that economic theory went entirely astray in the twentieth century they offer the misesian view as a radical alternative paradigm to mainstream theory caplan wrote that if mises and rothbard are right then mainstream economics is wrong but if hayek is right then mainstream economics merely needs to adjust its focus name austrian search 
economist  discussed the late twentieth century rift and erred to a discussion written by murray rothbard   and others in which they attack and disparage hayek  to try to drive a wedge between mises and hayek on the role of knowledge in economic calculation especially to the disparagement of hayek is unfair to these two great men unfaithful to the history of economic thought and went on to call the rift subversive to economic analysis and the historical understanding of the fall of eastern european communism 
in a 1999 book published by the  mises institute  hans hermann hoppe asserted that murray rothbard was the leader of the mainstream within austrian economics and contrasted rothbard with nobel laureate friedrich hayek whom he identified as a  and an opponent of the thought of mises and rothbard hoppe acknowledged that hayek was the most prominent austrian economist within academia but stated that hayek was an opponent of the austrian tradition which led from carl menger and böhm bawerk through mises to rothbard austrian economist  says that the austrian school can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories   economic theory and political theory according to block while hayek can be considered an austrian economist his views on political theory clash with the libertarian political theory which block sees as an integral part of the austrian school

economist bryan caplan argues that many austrians have not understood valid contributions of modern mainstream economics causing them to overstate their differences with it for example murray rothbard stated that he objected to the use of  in microeconomic theory caplan says that rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results are derived for any  transformation of an  function and do not entail cardinal utility name austrian search  name caplan_ord  the result is that conclusions about utility perences hold no matter what values are assigned to them

economist  argues that among developed countries those with high rates of taxation and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low rates of taxation and low social outlays he concludes that friedrich hayek was wrong to argue that high levels of government spending harms an economy and a generous social welfare state is not a road to serfdom but rather to fairness economic equality and international competitiveness  austrian economist  responded by arguing that countries with large public sectors have grown more slowlysudha r shenoy are high taxes the basis of freedom and prosperity http  wwwthefreemanonlineorg featured are high taxes the basis of freedom and prosperity

blockquotethe promise of an austrian theory of the trade cycle which might also serve to explain the severity of the great depression a feature of the early 1930s that provided the background for hayek’s successful appearance on the london scene soon proved deceptive three giants – keynes knight and sraffa – turned against the hapless austrians who in the middle of that black decade thus had to do battle on three fronts naturally it proved a task beyond their strengthludwig m lachmann in the market as an economic process oxford 1986 p ix  blockquote

economist paul krugman has argued that the theory cannot explain changes in unemployment over the business cycle austrian business cycle theory postulates that business cycles are caused by the misallocation of resources from consumption to investment during booms and out of investment during busts krugman argues that because total spending is equal to total income in an economy the theory implies that the reallocation of resources during busts would increase employment in consumption industries whereas in reality spending declines in all sectors of an economy during recessions he also argues that according to the theory the initial booms would also cause resource reallocation which implies an increase in unemployment during booms as well name krugman

economist jeffery hummel is critical of hayeks explanation of labor asymmetry in booms and busts he argues that hayek makes peculiar assumptions about demand curves for labor in his explanation of how a decrease in investment spending creates unemployment he also argues that the labor asymmetry can be explained in terms of a change in real wages but this explanation fails to explain the business cycle in terms of resource allocation name hummel 
milton friedman objected to the policy implications of the theory stating the following in a 1998 interview
blockquotei think the austrian business cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm if you go back to the 1930s which is a key point here you had the austrians sitting in london hayek and lionel robbins and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world you’ve just got to let it cure itself you can’t do anything about it you will only make it worse you have rothbard saying it was a great mistake not to let the whole banking system collapse i think by encouraging that kind of do nothing policy both in britain and in the united states they did harminterview in barrons magazine august 24 1998 archived at hoover institution http  wwwhooverorg publications hoover digest article 6459  blockquote
 
hummel argues that the austrian explanation of the business cycle fails on empirical grounds in particular he notes that investment spending remained positive in all recessions where there are data except for the  he argues that this casts doubt on the notion that recessions are caused by a reallocation of resources from industrial production to consumption since he argues that the austrian business cycle theory implies that net investment should be below zero during recessions name hummel  in response austrian economist  argues that the misallocation during booms does not preclude the possibility of demand increasing overallhttp  wwwreasonpaperscom pdf 30 rp_30_4pdf 
in 1969 economist milton friedman after examining the history of business cycles in the us concluded that the hayek mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence it is i believe false name friedman1969  he analyzed the issue using newer data in 1993 and again reached the same conclusion name friedman93  referring to friedmans discussion of the business cycle austrian economist roger garrison argued that friedmans empirical findings are broadly consistent with both monetarist and austrian views and goes on to argue that although friedmans model describes the economys performance at the highest level of aggregation austrian theory offers an insightful account of the market process that might underlie those aggregates

   definition and symptoms   
an abscess  is a collection of  that has built up within the  of the body name nejm2014  signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness pain warmth and swelling name nejm2014  the swelling may feel fluid filled when pressed name nejm2014  the area of redness often extends beyond the swelling name el2009  s and s are types of abscess that often involve s with carbuncles being larger name rosen2014chp120 
   cause   
they are usually caused by a  name cox2007  often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection name el2009  in the united states and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is  name nejm2014  rarely  can cause abscesses and this is more common in the  name rosen2014chp137  diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open name nejm2014   imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear name nejm2014  in abscesses around the   ct may be important to look for deeper infection name rosen2014chp137 
   management   
standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage name acepfive  there does not appear to be any benefit from also using s for this type of abscess in most people who are otherwise healthy name nejm2014   a small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with  after drainage name nejm2014  closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning name singer2011  sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient name nejm2014 
   epidemiology   
skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years name nejm2014  risk factors include  with rates reported as high as 65% in this population name langrod 2007 373  in 2005 in the united states 32 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess name taira2009  in australia around 13000 people were hospitalized in 2008 with the condition name vas2012 
abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface where they may be superficial pustules s or deep skin abscesses in the lungs   kidneys and tonsils  major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death 
the main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness heat swelling pain and loss of function there may also be high temperature fever and chills name nhs_abscess 
an internal abscess is more difficult to identify but signs include pain in the affected area a high temperature and generally feeling unwell
internal abscesses rarely heal themselves so prompt medical attention is indicated if such an abscess is suspected
an abscess could potentially be fatal although this is rare if it compresses vital structures such as the  in the context of a deep neck abscess
if superficial abscesses may be fluctuant when  this is a wave like motion which is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess 
risk factors for abscess formation include  name kha2008  another possible risk factor is a prior history of disc herniation or other spinal abnormality name kraeutler2014  though this has not been proven
abscesses are caused by  parasites or foreign substances
bacterial infection is the most common cause name cox2007  often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection name el2009  in the united states and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is  name nejm2014  among spinal subdural abscesses methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism involved name kraeutler2014 
rarely  can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world name rosen2014chp137  specific parasites known to do this include  and  name rosen2014chp137 
surgery of the  to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery name maliknelson2010  there is no evidence that  is a consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage name maliknelson2010 
es can be seen in patients with for example  such as  or   often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication  this wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area and then develops into an abscess  this often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the  which grows larger and more painful with time  like other abscesses perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment such as an incision and  or 
an incisional abscess is one that develops as a complication secondary to a  it presents as redness and warmth at the margins of the incision with purulent drainage from it name duff2009  if the diagnosis is uncertain the wound should be aspirated with a needle with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for  and  name duff2009 
an abscess is a  of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body
the organisms or foreign materials kill the local  resulting in the release of s  the cytokines trigger an  which draws large numbers of s to the area and increases the regional blood flow
the final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall or capsule that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures however such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object
an abscess is a localized collection of pus purulent inflammatory tissue caused by suppuration buried in a tissue an organ or a confined space lined by pyogenic membranerobins 8th 68 
abscesses may be classified as either skin abscesses or internal abscesses skin abscesses are common internal abscesses tend to be harder to diagnose and more serious name nhs_abscessunited kingdom national health service http  wwwnhsuk conditions abscess pages introductionaspx `abscess  skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses name medline_abscessmedline plus http  wwwnlmnihgov medlineplus ency article 001353htm `abscess 
for those with a history of intravenous drug use an  is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present name kha2008  in this population if there is also a fever present  should be considered name kha2008 
abscesses should be differentiated from s which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity
other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include  a  and  name rosen2014chp137  cellulitis typically also has an erythematous reaction but does not confer any purulent drainage name duff2009 
the standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining name acepfive  there does not appear to be any benefit from also using s in most cases name nejm2014  a small amount of evidence did not find benefit from packing the abscess with gauze name nejm2014 
the abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause which may require their removal if foreign objects are not the cause incision and drain of the abscess is standard treatment name acepfive  
in critical areas where surgery presents a high risk it may be delayed or used as a last resort  the drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the   warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess
most people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics name acepfive  antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses many sites of infection rapid disease progression the presence of  symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body or a health condition causing  name nejm2014  people who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics name nejm2014  if the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face hands or genitals then antibiotics may be indicated name nejm2014 
in those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment  bacteria is a common cause and an anti staphylococcus antibiotic such as  or  is used the  advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community acquired  mrsa and in those cases traditional antibiotics may be ineffective name nejm2014  alternative antibiotics effective against community acquired mrsa often include    and  name nejm2014  the  advises that typical cases of abscess from mrsa get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment name acepfive  if the condition is thought to be  rather than abscess consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin  therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low  levels
 is not needed if standard follow up care can be provided after the incision and drainage name acepfive  performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment name acepfive 
in north america after drainage an abscess cavity is often packed perhaps with cloth in an attempt to protect the healing wound however evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence bring more rapid healing or lead to fewer physician visits 
more recently several north american hospitals have opted for less invasive loop drainage over standard drainage and wound packing in one study of 143 pediatric outcomes a failure rate of 14% was reported in the loop group versus 105% in the packing group p030  while a separate study reported a 55% failure rate among loop patients 
closing an abscess right after draining it rather than leaving it open appears to speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning name singer2011  this may not apply to anorectal abscesses while they heal faster there may be a higher rate of recurrence than those left open name pmid6397949 
even without treatment they rarely result in death as they will naturally burst through the skin name rosen2014chp137 
skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years name nejm2014  risk factors include  with rates reported as high as 65% in this population name langrod 2007 373  in 2005 in the united states 32 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess name taira2009  in australia around 13000 people were hospitalized in 2008 for the disease name vas2012

gide’s biographer alan sheridan summed up gide’s life as a writer and an intellectual
gide was by general consent one of the dozen most important writers of the 20th century moreover no writer of such stature had led such an interesting life a life accessibly interesting to us as readers of his autobiographical writings his journal his voluminous correspondence and the testimony of others it was the life of a man engaging not only in the business of artistic creation but lecting on that process in his journal reading that work to his friends and discussing it with them a man who knew and corresponded with all the major literary figures of his own country and with many in germany and england who found daily nourishment in the latin french english and german classics and for much of his life in the bible who enjoyed playing chopin and other classic works on the piano and who engaged in commenting on the moral political and sexual questions of the dayandré gide a life in the present by alan sheridan harvard university press 1999 pages p xvi 
“gide’s fame rested ultimately of course on his literary works but unlike many writers he was no recluse he had a need of friendship and a genius for sustaining it”alan sheridan p xii  but his “capacity for love was not confined to his friends it spilled over into a concern for others less fortunate than himself”alan sheridan p 624 
andré gide’s writings spanned many genres – “as a master of prose narrative occasional dramatist and translator literary critic letter writer essayist and diarist andré gide provided twentieth century french literature with one of its most intriguing examples of the man of letters”article on andré gide in contemporary authors online’ 2003 retrieved with library card october 2014 
but as gide’s biographer alan sheridan points out “it is the fiction that lies at the summit of gide’s work”information in this paragraph is extracted from andré gide a life in the present by alan sheridan pages 629 633  here as in the oeuvre as a whole what strikes one first is the variety here too we see gide’s curiosity his youthfulness at work a usal to mine only one seam to repeat successful formulas…” the fiction spans the early years of symbolism to the “comic more inventive even fantastic” pieces to the later “serious heavily autobiographical first person narratives”  “in france gide was considered a great stylist in the classical sense “with his clear succinct spare deliberately subtly phrased sentences”
gide was also an avid letter writer and his surviving letters run into the thousands but it is the journal that sheridan calls “the pre eminently gidean mode of expression”information in this paragraph is extracted from andré gide a life in the present by alan sheridan pages 628  his first novel emerged from gide’s own journal and many of the first person narratives read more or less like journals in  edouards journal provides an alternative voice to the narrators” “in 1946 when pierre herbert asked gide which of his books he would choose if only one were to survive” gide replied i think it would be my journal  beginning at the age of eighteen or nineteen gide kept a journal all of his life and when these were first made available to the public they ran to thirteen hundred pagesjournals 1889 1913 by andré gide trans by justin o’brien p xii 
“each volume that gide wrote was intended to challenge itself what had preceded it and what could conceivably follow it this characteristic according to daniel moutote in his cahiers de andré gide essay is what makes gides work ‘essentially modern’ the perpetual renewal of the values by which one livesquote taken from the article on andré gide in contemporary authors online 2003 retrieved with library card october 2014  gide wrote in his journal in 1930 “the only drama that really interests me and that i should always be willing to depict anew is the debate of the individual with whatever keeps him from being authentic with whatever is opposed to his integrity to his integration most often the obstacle is within him and all the rest is merely accidental”journals 1889 1913 by andré gide trans by justin o’brien p xvii

algorithms for calculating variance play a major role in  a key difficulty in the design of good s for this problem is that formulas for the  may involve sums of squares which can lead to  as well as to  when dealing with large values
a formula for calculating the variance of an entire  of size n is

this algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population simply divide by n instead of nampnbsp−ampnbsp1 on the last line
because  and  can be very similar numbers  can lead to the  of the result to be much less than the inherent precision of the  arithmetic used to perform the computation  thus this algorithm should not be used in practice name einarsson2005  name chan1983  this is particularly bad if the standard deviation is small relative to the mean however the algorithm can be improved by adopting the method of the 
we can use a property of the variance to avoid the catastrophic cancellation in this formula
namely the variance is  with respect to changes in a 
math\operatorname{var}x k \operatorname{var}x math
   
with mathk math any constant which leads to the new formula
maths^2   \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i 1}^n x_i k^2   \sum_{i 1}^n x_i k^2 n}{n 1} \ math
   
the closer mathk math is to the mean value the more accurate the result will be but just choosing a value inside the
samples range will guarantee the desired stability if the values mathx_i   k math are small then there are no problems with the sum of its squares on the contrary if they are large it necessarily means that the variance is large as well in any case the second term in the formula is always smaller than the first one theore no cancellation may occur name chan1983  
if we take just the first sample as mathk math the algorithm can be written in  as

an alternative approach using a different formula for the variance first computes the sample mean

and then computes the sum of the squares of the differences from the mean

this algorithm is numerically stable if n is small name einarsson2005   however the results of both of these simple algorithms i and ii can depend inordinately on the ordering of the data and can give poor results for very large data sets due to repeated roundoff error in the accumulation of the sums techniques such as  can be used to combat this error to a degree

it is often useful to be able to compute the variance in a single pass inspecting each value mathx_i math only once for example when the data are being collected without enough storage to keep all the values or when costs of memory access dominate those of computation  for such an  a  is required between quantities from which the required statistics can be calculated in a numerically stable fashion

this algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to  but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop  for a particularly robust two pass algorithm for computing the variance first compute and subtract an estimate of the mean and then use this algorithm on the residuals

assume that all floating point operations use the standard  arithmetic consider the sample 4 7 13 16 from an infinite population based on this sample the estimated population mean is 10 and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30  both algorithm i and algorithm ii compute these values correctly  next consider the sample 10sup8 supampnbsp+ampnbsp4 10sup8 supampnbsp+ampnbsp7 10sup8 supampnbsp+ampnbsp13 10sup8 supampnbsp+ampnbsp16 which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample  algorithm ii computes this variance estimate correctly but algorithm i returns 29333333333333332 instead of 30  while this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of algorithm i it is easy to find data that reveal a major flaw in the naive algorithm take the sample to be 10sup9 supampnbsp+ampnbsp4 10sup9 supampnbsp+ampnbsp7 10sup9 supampnbsp+ampnbsp13 10sup9 supampnbsp+ampnbsp16  again the estimated population variance of 30 is computed correctly by algorithm ii but the naive algorithm now computes it as −17066666666666666  this is a serious problem with algorithm i and is due to  in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm

choi and sweetman
 name choi2010 
offer two alternative methods to compute the skewness and kurtosis each of which can save substantial computer memory requirements and cpu time in certain applications the first approach is to compute the statistical moments by separating the data into bins and then computing the moments from the geometry of the resulting histogram which effectively becomes a  for higher moments one benefit is that the statistical moment calculations can be carried out to arbitrary accuracy such that the computations can be tuned to the precision of eg the data storage format or the original measurement hardware  a relative histogram of a random variable can be constructed in
the conventional way the range of potential values is
divided into bins and the number of occurrences within each bin are
counted and plotted such that the area of each rectangle equals
the portion of the sample values within that bin
 math hx_k \frac{hx_k}{a} math
where mathhx_k math and mathhx_k math represent the frequency and
the relative frequency at bin mathx_k math and matha  \sum_{k 1}^{k} hx_k
\\delta x_k math is the total area of the histogram after this
normalization the mathn math raw moments and central moments of mathxt math
can be calculated from the relative histogram
 math
 m_n^{h}   \sum_{k 1}^{k}  x_k^n \ hx_k \delta x_k
              \frac{1}{a} \sum_{k 1}^{k}  x_k^n \ hx_k \delta x_k
 math
 math
 \theta_n^{h}  \sum_{k 1}^{k} \bigx_k m_1^{h}\big^n \ hx_k\delta x_k
                 \frac{1}{a} \sum_{k 1}^{k} \bigx_k m_1^{h}\big^n \ hx_k \delta x_k
 math
where the superscript math^{h} math indicates the moments are
calculated from the histogram for constant bin width math\delta
x_k \delta x math these two expressions can be simplified using mathi  a \delta x math
 math
 m_n^{h}  \frac{1}{i} {\sum_{k 1}^{k} x_k^n \ hx_k}
 math
 math
 \theta_n^{h}  \frac{1}{i}{\sum_{k 1}^{k} \bigx_k m_1^{h}\big^n \ hx_k}
 math
the second approach from choi and sweetman
 name choi2010  
is an analytical methodology to combine statistical moments from individual segments of a time history such that the resulting overall moments are those of the complete time history this methodology could be used for parallel computation of statistical moments with subsequent combination of those moments or for combination of statistical moments computed at sequential times
if mathq math sets of statistical moments are known
math\gamma_{0q}\mu_{q}\sigma^2_{q}\alpha_{3q}\alpha_{4q}
\quad  math for mathq 12q  math then each math\gamma_n math can
be expressed in terms of the equivalent mathn math raw moments
 math
 \gamma_{nq}  m_{nq} \gamma_{0q} \qquad \quad \textrm{for} \quad n 1234  \quad \text{ and } \quad q   12 \dots q
 math
where math\gamma_{0q} math is generally taken to be the duration of the mathq^{th} math time history or the number of points if math\delta t math is constant
the benefit of expressing the statistical moments in
terms of math\gamma math is that the mathq math sets can be combined by
addition and there is no upper limit on the value of mathq math
 math
 \gamma_{nc}  \sum_{q 1}^{q}\gamma_{nq} \quad \quad \textrm{for} \quad n 01234
 math
where the subscript math_c math represents the concatenated
time history or combined math\gamma math these combined values of
math\gamma math can then be inversely transformed into raw moments
representing the complete concatenated time history
 math
 m_{nc} \frac{\gamma_{nc}}{\gamma_{0c}} \quad \textrm{for} \quad n 1234
 math
known relationships between the raw moments mathm_n math and the central moments  math \theta_n   ex \mu^n math
are then used to compute the central moments of the concatenated time history  finally the statistical moments of the concatenated history are computed from the central moments
 math
 \mu_c m_{1c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \sigma^2_c \theta_{2c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \alpha_{3c} \frac{\theta_{3c}}{\sigma_c^3}
 \ \ \ \ \ \alpha_{4c} {\frac{\theta_{4c}}{\sigma_c^4}} 3
 math
very similar algorithms can be used to compute the   the naive algorithm is
math\operatorname{cov}xy   \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i 1}^n x_i y_i   \sum_{i 1}^n x_i\sum_{i 1}^n y_i n}{n} \ math
for the algorithm above one could use the following python code
source lang python
def naive_covariancedata1 data2
    n   lendata1
    sum12   0
    sum1   sumdata1
    sum2   sumdata2
    for i in rangen
        sum12 +  data1idata2i
    covariance   sum12   sum1sum2   n   n
    return covariance
 source
as for the variance the covariance of two random variables is also shift invariant so given that  mathk_x math and mathk_y math are whatever two constant values it can be written
math\operatorname{cov}xy   \operatorname{cov}x k_xy k_y   \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i 1}^n x_i k_x y_i k_y   \sum_{i 1}^n x_i k_x\sum_{i 1}^n y_i k_y n}{n} \ math
and again choosing a value inside the range of values will stabilize the formula against catastrophic cancellation as well as make it more robust against big sums taking the first value of each data set the algorithm can be written as
source lang python
def shifted_data_covariancedatax datay
   n   lendatax
   if n  2
     return 0
   kx   datax0
   ky   datay0

the two pass algorithm first computes the sample means and then the covariance
math\bar x   \displaystyle \sum_{i 1}^n x_i n math
math\bar y   \displaystyle \sum_{i 1}^n y_i n math
math\operatorname{cov}xy   \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i 1}^n x_i   \bar xy_i   \bar y}{n} \ math

a slightly more accurate compensated version performs the full naive algorithm on the residuals  the final sums math\textstyle\sum x_i math and math\textstyle\sum y_i math should be zero but the second pass compensates for any small error
a slight modification of the online algorithm for computing the variance yields an online algorithm for the covariance

a stable one pass algorithm exists similar to the one above that computes co moment math\textstyle c_n   \sum_{i 1}^n x_i   \bar x_ny_i   \bar y_n math
math\bar x_n   \bar x_{n 1} + \frac{x_n   \bar x_{n 1}}{n} \ math
math\bar y_n   \bar y_{n 1} + \frac{y_n   \bar y_{n 1}}{n} \ math
mathc_n   c_{n 1} + x_n   \bar x_ny_n   \bar y_{n 1}   c_{n 1} + y_n   \bar y_nx_n   \bar x_{n 1} math
the apparent asymmetry in that last equation is due to the fact that math\textstyle x_n   \bar x_n   \frac{n 1}{n}x_n   \bar x_{n 1} math so both update terms are equal to math\textstyle \frac{n 1}{n}x_n   \bar x_{n 1}y_n   \bar y_{n 1} math  even greater accuracy can be achieved by first computing the means then using the stable one pass algorithm on the residuals
thus we can compute the covariance as
math\begin{align}
\operatorname{cov}_nxy   \frac{c_n}{n} amp  \frac{\operatorname{cov}_{n 1}xy\cdotn 1 + x_n   \bar x_ny_n   \bar y_{n 1}}{n}\\
   amp  \frac{\operatorname{cov}_{n 1}xy\cdotn 1 + y_n   \bar y_nx_n   \bar x_{n 1}}{n}\\
   amp  \frac{\operatorname{cov}_{n 1}xy\cdotn 1 + \frac{n 1}{n}x_n   \bar x_{n 1}y_n   \bar y_{n 1}}{n}
\end{align} math
likewise there is a formula for combining the covariances of two sets that can be used to parallelize the computation
mathc_x   c_a + c_b + \bar x_a   \bar x_b\bar y_a   \bar y_b\cdot\frac{n_a n_b}{n_x} math

while wild almond species are toxic domesticated almonds are not  argues that a common genetic mutation causes an absence of amygdalin and this mutant was grown by early farmers at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps and later intentionally in their orchards  zohary and hopf believe that almonds were one of the earliest domesticated  due to the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed thus in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of  name zohary  domesticated almonds appear in the  3000–2000 bc such as the archaeological sites of numeria  name ladizinsky99  or possibly a little earlier another well known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in s tomb in egypt c 1325 bc probably imported from the levant name zohary   of the an countries that the royal botanic garden edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds   is the northernmost though the domesticated form can be found as far north as

antisemitism may be manifested in many ways ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual jews to organized  by mobs state police or even military attacks on entire jewish communities although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century it is now also applied to historic anti jewish incidents notable instances of  include the  in 1096 the  in 1290 the  in 1391 the persecutions of the  the  in 1492  of 1648–1657 various  between 1821 and 1906 the 1894–1906  in france the  in german occupied europe official  and arab and muslim involvement in the 
the origin of antisemitic terminologies is found in responses of  to the views of  as  writes the compound anti semitism appears to have been used first by steinschneider who challenged renan on account of his anti semitic prejudices ie his derogation of the semites as a  https  booksgooglecom booksid cqon0y8eng4camppg pa594 the jewish question biography of a world problem fairleigh dickinson university press 1990 pampnbsp594 isbn 0 8386 3252 1 quote the compound anti semitism appears to have been used first by steinschneider who challenged renan on account of his anti semitic prejudices ie his derogation of the semites as a race  
 similarly writes the german word antisemitisch was first used in 1860 by the austrian jewish scholar moritz steinschneider 1816 1907 in the phrase antisemitische vorurteile antisemitic prejudices steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the french philosopher ernest renans false ideas about how s were inferior to s name the antisemitisch 18 60 1816 1907 antisemitische vorurteile antisemitic prejudices renans  
 theories concerning race civilization and progress had become quite widespread in europe in the second half of the 19th century especially as n nationalistic historian  did much to promote this form of racism he coined the phrase the jews are our misfortune which would later be widely used by  the history of anti semitism vol 3 from voltaire to wagner university of pennsylvania press 2003 p 404 isbn 978 0 8122 1865 7  in treitschkes writings semitic was synonymous with jewish in contrast to its use by renan and others
in 1873 german journalist  published a pamphlet der sieg des judenthums über das germanenthum vom nicht confessionellen standpunkt aus betrachtet the victory of the jewish spirit over the germanic spirit observed from a non religious perspective https  archiveorg details dersiegdesjudenthumsueberdasgermanenthum der sieg des judenthums über das germanenthum vom nicht confessionellen standpunkt aus betrachtet rudolph costenoble 1879 8th edition archiveorg     supamp or sup  http  wwwkevinmacdonaldnet marr text englishpdf  the victory of the jewish spirit over the germanic spirit observed from a non religious perspective translation gerhard rohringer  2009   in which he used the word semitismus interchangeably with the word judentum to denote both jewry the jews as a collective and jewishness the quality of being jewish or the jewish spirit
this use of semitismus was followed by a coining of antisemitismus which was used to indicate opposition to the jews as a people and opposition to the jewish spirit which marr interpreted as infiltrating german culture his next pamphlet der weg zum siege des germanenthums über das judenthum the way to victory of the germanic spirit over the jewish spirit 1880 presents a development of marrs ideas further and may present the first published use of the german word antisemitismus antisemitism
the pamphlet became very popular and in the same year he founded the antisemiten liga league of antisemites  the first german organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to germany and german culture posed by the jews and their influence and advocating their  from the country
so far as can be ascertained the word was first widely printed in 1881 when marr published zwanglose antisemitische hefte and  used the term antisemiten in the january issue of neue freie presse
the  reported ‘in february 1881 a correspondent of the  speaks of anti semitism as a designation which recently came into use allg zeit d jud 1881 pampnbsp138 on 19 july 1882 the editor says this quite recent anti semitism is hardly three years old’ 
the related term philosemitism was coined around 1885
despite the use of the pix anti  the term anti semitic is not a direct opposite of semitic which  makes the term a  within common day to day usage however the terms anti semitism and antisemitism have accepted and specific use to describe prejudice against s alone and in general name mwdef   name justjews  
this is despite the fact that there are other speakers of s eg s  or  and that not all jews speak a semitic language
the term antisemitic has been used on occasion with meanings inclusive of  against other semitic language peoples such as arabs with the validity of such use being challenged https  booksgooglecom booksid dyr7sqcme9gcamppg pa34 aftershock anti zionism and antisemitism dundurn press 2005 p 34  
the terms anti semitism and antisemitism are both in use some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because if you use the hyphenated form you consider the words semitism semite semitic as meaningful whereas in antisemitic parlance semites really stands for jews just that name almogalmog shmuel http  sicsahujiacil hyphenhtm whats in a hyphen sicsa report newsletter of the  summer 1989   name bauer  name bauer2bauer yehuda a history of the holocaust franklin watts 1982 p 52 isbn 0 531 05641 4  for example  supported the unhyphenated spelling in order to dispel the notion that there is an entity semitism which anti semitism opposes name fackenheim  others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include padraic ohare professor of religious and theological studies and director of the center for the study of jewish christian muslim relations at   professor of holocaust studies at the avraham harman institute of contemporary jewry at the  of  and  historian and novelist according to carroll who first cites ohare and bauer on the existence of something called semitism the hyphenated word thus lects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism 
though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against jews and according to olaf blaschke has become an umbrella term for negative stereotypes about jewscited in sonja weinberg https  booksgooglecom booksid 0hdeepouqm0camppg pa18 pogroms and riots german press responses to anti jewish violence in germany and russia 1881–1882 peter lang 2010 p 18  a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions
holocaust scholar and  professor  defines it as a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes and in culture as myth ideology folklore and imagery and in actions—social or legal discrimination political mobilization against the jews and collective or state violence—which results in and or is designed to distance displace or destroy jews as jews
elaborating on feins definition dietz bering of the  writes that to antisemites jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature that is their bad traits are incorrigible because of this bad nature 1 jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective 2 jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies 3 jews bring disaster on their host societies or on the whole world they are doing it secretly theore the anti semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial bad jewish character 
for sonja weinberg as distinct from economic and religious  antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation a resort to science to defend itself new functional forms and organisational differences it was anti liberal racialist and nationalist it promoted the myth that  it served to consolidate social identity it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalismsonja weinberg https  booksgooglecom booksid 0hdeepouqm0camppg pa18 pogroms and riots german press responses to anti jewish violence in germany and russia 1881–1882 pp 18–19 
 defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice hatred or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest according to lewis antisemitism is marked by two distinct features jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others and they are accused of cosmic evil thus it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute jews without necessarily being anti semitic unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism name autogenerated1 http  hnnus blogs entries 21832html the new anti semitism the american scholar volume 75 no 1 winter 2006 pp 25–36 the paper is based on a lecture delivered at  on 24 march 2004 
there have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally the us department of state states that while there is no universally accepted definition there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses for the purposes of its 2005 report on global anti semitism the term was considered to mean hatred toward jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the jewish religion and or ethnicity name usdshttp  wwwstategov g drl rls 40258htm report on global anti semitism  5 january 2005 
in 2005 the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia now  then an agency of the  developed a more detailed  which states antisemitism is a certain perception of jews which may be expressed as hatred toward jews rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward jewish or non jewish individuals and or their property toward jewish community institutions and religious facilities it also adds that such manifestations could also target the state of israel conceived as a jewish collectivity but that criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic it provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself including promoting the harming of jews in the name of an ideology or religion promoting negative stereotypes of jews holding jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual jewish person or group  or accusing jews or israel of exaggerating it and accusing jews of  or a greater allegiance to israel than their own country it also lists ways in which attacking israel could be antisemitic and states that denying the jewish people their right to self determination eg by claiming that the existence of a state of israel is a racist endeavor can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation or holding jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of israel  late in 2013 the definition was removed from the website of the fundamental rights agency a spokesperson said that it had never been regarded as official and that the agency did not intend to develop its own definition

antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways  mentions social antisemitism economic antisemitism religious antisemitism and political antisemitism as examples könig points out that these different forms demonstrate that the origins of anti semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods könig asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti semitism  these difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism the forms identified are substantially the same it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ  identifies three forms of antisemitism  economic antisemitism and ethnologic antisemitism

 is a landlocked country in the  region between the  and s bordered on the north and east by  and  and on the south and west by  and 
the terrain is mostly mountainous and flat with fast flowing rivers and few forests but with many trees the climate is highland continental hot summers and cold winters the land rises to 4095 m above sea level at 
pollution from toxic chemicals such as  is not helping the already poor soil quality in many parts of the country
armenia is trying to address its environmental problems it has established a ministry of nature protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the commonwealth of independent states cis a group of 12 former soviet republics and with members of the international community on environmental issues the armenian government is working toward closing the armenian nuclear power plant as soon as alternative energy sources are identified
 
 
armenia is located in southern transcaucasia the region southwest of  between the  and the  modern armenia term means  which occupies part of historical armenia whose ancient centres were in the valley of the  and the region around  in turkey armenia is bordered on the north by georgia on the east by  on the southwest by the  on the south by iran and on the west by turkey
twenty five million years ago a geological upheaval pushed up the earths crust to form the armenian plateau creating the complex topography of modern armenia the lesser caucasus range extends through northern armenia runs southeast between  and azerbaijan then passes roughly along the armenian azerbaijani border to iran thus situated the mountains make travel from north to south difficult geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes which have plagued armenia in december 1988 the second largest city in the republic leninakan now  was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25000 people
about half of armenias area of approximately  has an elevation of at least  and only 3% of the country lies below  the lowest points are in the valleys of the araks river and the debet river in the far north which have elevations of  respectively elevations in the lesser caucasus vary between  to the southwest of the range is the armenian plateau which slopes southwestward toward the araks river on the turkish border the plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes the largest of these   high is also the highest point in armenia most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country where the two major cities  and gyumri which was called aleksandropol during the tsarist period are located
the valleys of the debet and akstafa rivers form the chief routes into armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains lake sevan  across at its widest point and  long is by far the largest lake it lies  above sea level on the plateau terrain is most rugged in the extreme southeast which is drained by the bargushat river and most moderate in the araks river valley to the extreme southwest most of armenia is drained by the  or its tributary the  which flows from lake sevan the araks forms most of armenias border with turkey and iran while the  form the border between armenias southern  and azerbaijans adjacent nakhchivan autonomous republic
temperatures in armenia generally depend upon elevation mountain formations block the moderating climatic influences of the mediterranean sea and the black sea creating wide seasonal variations on the armenian plateau the mean midwinter temperature is  and the mean midsummer temperature exceeds  average precipitation ranges from  per year in the lower araks river valley to  at the highest altitudes despite the harshness of winter in most parts the fertility of the plateaus volcanic soil made armenia one of the worlds earliest sites of agricultural activity
a broad public discussion of environmental problems began in the mid 1980s when the first green groups formed in opposition to yerevans intense industrial air pollution and to nuclear power generation in the wake of the 1986 reactor explosion at chernobyl environmental issues helped form the basis of the nationalist independence movement when environmental demonstrations subsequently merged with those for other political causes in the late 1980s
in the postcommunist era armenia faces the same massive environmental cleanup that confronts the other former soviet republics as they emerge from the centralized planning systems disastrous approach to resource management by 1980 the infrequency of sightings of mount ararat which looms about sixty kilometers across the turkish border became a symbol of worsening air pollution in yerevan
in independent armenia environmental issues divide society and scientists sharply into those who fear environmental time bombs and those who view resumption of pollution prone industrial operations as the only means of improving the countrys economy in the early 1990s the latter group blamed armenias economic woes on the role played by the former in closing major industries
in 1994 three national environmental laws were in effect the law on environmental protection the basic law on the environment and the law on mineral resources the council of ministers armenias cabinet includes a minister of the environment however no comprehensive environmental protection program has emerged and decisions on environmental policy have been made on an ad hoc basis
environmental conditions in armenia have been worsened as a result of war with azerbaijan over the historic armenian region of  historically known as  hostilities along armenian azerbaijan border disrupted crucial supply routes which armenia was greatly dependent on the winters of 1991 92 1992–93 and 1993–94 brought enormous hardship to a population lacking heat and electric power the large scale felling of trees for fuel during the winters has created another environmental crisis during these years azerbaijan closed its border with armenia rendering possibility of supplies from azerbaijan an impossibility this led the government to propose reconstruction of the armenian atomic power station at metsamor which was closed after the 1988 earthquake because of its location in an earthquake prone area and which had the same safety problems as reactors listed as dangerous in bulgaria russia and slovakia after heated debates over startup continued through 1993 french and russian nuclear consultants declared operating conditions basically safe continuation of the blockade into 1994 gave added urgency to the decision
another environmental concern is a significant drop in lake sevans water level because of drawdowns for irrigation and the diversion of water to hydroelectric plants to compensate for the electric power lost through the inactivity of the nuclear plant at metsamor this crisis was addressed in 1992 93 by construction of a tunnel to divert water into the lake from the arpa river engineers estimated that once the project is finished the tunnel will allow 500 million cubic meters of water to be drawn from the lake annually while maintaining a constant water level the ministry of the environment reported that the lakes water level had dropped by fifty centimeters in 1993 experts said that this drop brought the level to within twenty seven centimeters of the critical point where flora and fauna would be endangered
among major industrial centers closed to curtail pollution were the nairit chemical plant the alaverdy metallurgical plant and the vanadzor chemical combine economic requirements triumphed over environmental considerations when the soviet era nairit plant was reopened in january 1992 after being closed in 1989 because of the massive air pollution it caused newly independent armenia needed the income from foreign sales of nairit rubber and chemical products many of which had been assigned exclusively to that plant under the soviet system and were still unavailable elsewhere to the former soviet republics in the early 1990s up to date environmental safety technology and adherence to international standards were promised at nairit when the decision to resume production was announced

the politics of armenia takes place in a framework of a   republic whereby the president is the  and of a platform multi party system  is exercised by the government  is vested in both the government and parliament
the population of  voted overwhelmingly for independence in a september 1991 erendum followed by a presidential election in october 1991 that gave 83% of the vote to  ter petrosyan had been elected head of government in 1990 when the  defeated the armenian communist party ter petrosyan was re elected in 1996 following public demonstrations against ter petrosyans policies on  the president resigned in january 1998 and was replaced by prime minister  who was elected president in march 1998 following the  of prime minister  and parliament speaker  and six other officials on 27 october 1999 a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former armenian national movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force kocharyan to resign kocharyan was successful in riding out the unrest in may 2000  replaced  as prime minister
kocharyans re election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot rigging he went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of parliament these were rejected in a erendum the following may at the same time as parliamentary elections which left kocharyans party in a very powerful position in parliament there were mounting calls for the presidents resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a erendum of confidence in him
the unicameral parliament also called the  is dominated by a coalition called unity miasnutyun between the  and  parties and the agro technical peoples union aided by numerous independents  which was outlawed by ter petrosyan in 1995–96 but legalized again after ter petrosyan resigned also usually supports the government a new party the  is headed by ex prime minister  brother of  and has become the primary voice of the opposition which also includes the  the  of  and elements of the former ter petrosyan government
the government of armenias stated aim is to build a western style  as the basis of its  however international observers have questioned the fairness of armenias parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional erendum since 1995 citing polling deficiencies lack of cooperation by the  and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places for the most part however armenia is considered one of the more pro democratic nations in the   observers noted though that opposition parties and candidates have been able to mount credible campaigns and proper polling procedures have been generally followed elections since 1998 have represented an improvement in terms of both fairness and efficiency although they are still considered to have fallen short of international standards the new constitution of 1995 greatly expanded the powers of the executive branch and gives it much more influence over the judiciary and municipal officials
the observance of human rights in armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings  allegedly still goes largely unreported while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers public demonstrations usually take place without government interference though one rally in november 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law nontraditional churches especially the  have been subjected to harassment sometimes violently all churches apart from the  must register with the government and proselytizing was forbidden by law though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies the governments policy toward conscientious objection is in transition as part of armenias accession to the council of europe most of armenias ethnic  population was deported in 1988–1989 and remain ugees largely in azerbaijan armenias record on discrimination toward the few remaining  is generally good the government does not restrict internal or international travel although freedom of the press and speech are guaranteed the government maintains its monopoly over television and radio broadcasting

after independence the emerging new political and economic relations required the creation of a state financial and economic system able to sustain the benefits to both state and society under the conditions of a liberal economy meanwhile it was necessary to create a new legislative field to determine the financial control principles and approaches one such institution was the control chamber of the republic of armenia national assembly a new system of state financial control this external state control performing structure was founded on may 29 1996 a few main objectives of control chamber were to exercise comprehensive and professional control over the effective spending of state revenues and funds ensuring transparency of their usage the next major function of the control chamber was the analyzes of presented reports
the control chamber of armenia was formed by the national assembly and was accountable to the country’s legislative body the chamber was submitting to the national assembly semiannual erences control progress reports annual plans and reports of the chambers activities thus making its study results public the principles of the ra na control chamber activity were those of independence collegiality and publicity
it was performing its activities on its own independently from the bodies of power being guided by the principles of the lima declaration as well as by those of   control chamber’s first steps were directed towards the determination of the its structural functional divisions professional departments and fields of activity according to the charter approved by the national assembly state budget privatisation and denationalisation foreign loans and credits the comprehensive analytical and informational methodological were operating within the chamber of control later with the amendments to the charter the number of control chamber departments was increased by one with the addition of the department of control over community budgets

on the basis of the new legal requirements structural changes have been made in the chamber the departments have been ormed on a functional basis and a number of new divisions have been added  eg the department of internal control such working dynamics does not rule out the possibility of future coc structural changeshttp  wwwcocam historyengaspx

 is the second most densely populated of the former  because of its small size it is situated between the  and the  bordered on the north and east by  and  and on the south and west by  and 
until independence armenias economy was based largely on —     and  it was highly dependent on outside resources  accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 armenian mines produce    and  the vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel including gas and nuclear fuel from russia for its one nuclear power plant the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric small amounts of coal gas and petroleum have not yet been developed
like other former states armenias economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former soviet trading patterns soviet investment in and support of armenian industry has virtually disappeared so that few major enterprises are still able to function in addition the effects of the  which killed more than 25000 people and made 500000 homeless are still being felt although a cease fire has held since 1994 the conflict with  over  has not been resolved the consequent blockade along both the azerbaijani and turkish borders has devastated the economy because of armenias dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials land routes through azerbaijan and turkey are closed routes through georgia and iran are adequate and reliable in 1992 93 the gdp had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level the national currency the  suffered  for the first few years after its introduction in 1993
armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years new sectors such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology primarily  which is left from the ussr era and is owned by external investors this steady economic progress has earned armenia increasing support from international institutions the  imf  ebrd as well as other international financial institutions ifis and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans total loans extended to armenia since 1993 exceed 800 million these loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit stabilizing the local currency developing private businesses energy the agriculture food processing transportation and health and education sectors and ongoing rehabilitation work in the 
continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management including increasing revenue collection improving the investment climate and accelerating privatization a liberal foreign investment law was approved in june 1994 and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997 as well as a program on state property privatization the government has made major strides toward joining the world trade organization by 1994 however the armenian government had launched an ambitious imf sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995 2005 armenia joined the  wto in january 2003 armenia also has managed to slash inflation stabilize its currency and privatize most small  and medium sized enterprises armenias unemployment rate however remains high despite strong economic growth the chronic energy shortages armenia suffered in the early and mid 1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at  armenia is now a net energy exporter although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace metsamor which is under international pressure to close the electricity distribution system was  in 2002 armenias severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid  from armenians working abroad and foreign direct investment economic ties with  remain close especially in the energy sector the government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005 but anti corruption measures have been more difficult to implement investment in the  and industrial sectors is expected to continue in 2006 and will help to ensure annual average real  growth of about 139%
under the old soviet central planning system armenia had developed a modern industrial sector supplying machine tools textiles and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy since the implosion of the ussr in december 1991 armenia has switched to small scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the soviet era the agricultural sector has long term needs for more investment and updated technology the privatization of industry has been at a slower pace but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration armenia is a food importer and its  deposits  and  are small the ongoing conflict with azerbaijan over the ethnic armenian dominated region of nagorno karabakh which was part of soviet azerbaijan and the breakup of the centrally directed  of the former soviet union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s by 1994 however the armenian government had launched an ambitious imf sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995 99 armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small  and medium sized enterprises the chronic energy shortages armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at metsamor continued russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially but have been offset by international aid domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment
at the beginning of the 20th century the territory of present day armenia was a backward agricultural region with some  mining and  production from 1914 through 1921 caucasian armenia suffered from war revolution the influx of ugees from turkish armenia disease hunger and economic misery about 200000 people died in 1919 alone at that point only american relief efforts saved armenia from total collapsebudget ran large deficits
the first soviet armenian government regulated economic activity stringently nationalising all economic enterprises requisitioning  from peasants and suppressing most private market activity this first experiment of state control ended with the advent of soviet leader s  nep of 192127 this policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks but peasants could market much of their grain and small businesses could function in armenia the nep years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post world war i period by 1926 agricultural production in armenia had reached nearly three quarters of its prewar level
by the end of the 1920s stalins regime had revoked the nep and established a state monopoly on all economic activity once this occurred the main goal of soviet economic policy in armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one amongst other restrictions peasnats now were forced to sell nearly all their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market from the 1930s through the 1960s an industrial infrastructure was constructed besides hydroelectric plants and canals roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from azerbaijan and russia
the stalinist command economy in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution cam from state authorities survived in all its essential features until the fall of the soviet regime in 1991 in the early stages of the communist economic revolution armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a proletarian society between 1929 and 1939 the percentage of armenias work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31% by 1935 industry supplied 62% of armenias economic production highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era the armenian economy showed few signs of self sufficiency at any time during that period in 1988 armenia produced only 09% of the  of the soviet union 12% of industry 07% of agriculture the republic retained 14% of total state budget revenue delivered 637% of its nmp to other republics and exported only 14% of what it produced to markets outside the soviet union
armenias industry was especially dependent on the soviet military industrial complex about 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defence and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the soviet union when massive cuts were made in national defence expenditures as the republics economy faced the prospects of compiting in world markets in the mid 1990s the great liabilities of armenias industry are its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the countrys heavy industrial plants
in 1991 armenias last year as a soviet republic national income fell 12% from the previous year while per capita groos national product was 4920 rubles only 68% of the soviet average in large part due to the earthquake of 1988 the azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the soviet union the armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels in the first years of independence 199293 inflation was extremely high productivity and national income dropped dramatically and the national budget ran large deficits
armenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s when  began advocating economic orm coopratives were set up in the service sector particularly in restaurants although substantial resistance came from the  cpa and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy in the late 1980s much of armenias economy already was opening either semi officially or illegally with widespread  and  the so called mafia made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends sabotaged the efforts of ormers to create a lawful market system when the december 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of armenia much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements
beginning in 1991 the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in armenia the azerbaijani blockade and the costs of the  in 1992 the law on the programme of privatisation and decentralisation of incompletely constructed facilities established a state privatisation committee with members from all political parties in middle 1993 the committee announced a two year privatisation programme whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises mostly services and light industries the remaining 70% including many bankrupt nonfunctional enterprises were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction to encourage private initiative for all enterprises the workers would receive 20% of their firms property free of charge 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government with perence given to members of the labour organisations a major problem of this system however was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection bankruptcy monopoly policy and consumer protection
in the first post communist years efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the  to spread information about armenias investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity a specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property
a few armenians living abroad made large scale investments besides a toy factory and construction projects diaspora armenians built a cold storage plant which in its first years had little produce to store and established the  in yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy
armenia was admitted to the  in may 1992 and to the  in september a year later the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation and the removal of all s quotas and restrictions of foreign trade although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy prime minister  informed the united states officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year

armenia supports ethnic armenians in the nagorno–karabakh republic in the longstanding and very bitter conflict against the azerbaijani government
the current conflict over nagorno karabakh nk began in 1988 when armenian demonstrations against azerbaijani rule broke out in nagorno–karabakh and later in armenia and the nagorno karabakh  voted to secede from azerbaijan and join armenia soon violence broke out against ethnic armenians in azerbaijan and ethnic azeris in armenia in 1990 after violent episodes in nagorno–karabakh and azerbaijani cities like   and  moscow declared a state of emergency in karabakh sent troops to the region and  killing over a hundred civilians in april 1991 azerbaijani militia and soviet forces targeted armenian populations in karabakh known as  moscow also deployed troops to  following the collapse of the  conflict escalated into a full scale war between the nagorno karabakh republic supported by armenia and azerbaijan military action was influenced by the russian military which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring sides in order to keep both under control
more than 30000 people were killed in the fighting from 1988 to 1994 in may 1992 ethnic armenian forces seized  and  thereby linking nagorno karabakh to armenia by october 1993 ethnic armenian forces succeeded in taking almost all of former nkao lachin and large areas in southwestern azerbaijan in 1993 the  adopted  calling for the cessation of hostilities unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region fighting continued however until may 1994 when russia brokered a cease fire between the three sides
negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the minsk group of the  the minsk group is co chaired by russia france and the united states and has representation from turkey the us several european nations armenia and azerbaijan despite the 1994 cease fire sporadic violations  fire and  incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year
since 1997 the minsk group co chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict one side or the other rejected each of those proposals beginning in 1999 the presidents of azerbaijan and armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face to face meetings often facilitated by the minsk group co chairs the osce sponsored a round of negotiations between the presidents in  florida us secretary of state  launched the talks on 3 april 2001 and the negotiations continued with mediation by the us russia and france until 6 april 2001 the co chairs are continuing to work with the two presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace

armenias most notable recent foreign policy success came with 29 august treaty with russia on friendship cooperation and mutual assistance in which moscow committed itself to the defense of armenia should it be attacked by a third party russia is the key regional security player and has proved a valuable historical ally for armenia although it appeared as a response to aliyevs us trip the treaty had probably long been under development however it is clear from the wider context of armenian foreign policy that—while yerevan welcomes the russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on moscow nor to become part of a confrontation between russian and us led alliances in the transcaucasus

turkey was one of the first countries to recognize armenias independence in 1991 despite this for most of the 20th century and early 21st century relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons some bones of contention include the unresolved karabakh conflict between armenia and azerbaijan which has resulted in turkey imposing a blockade on armenia that is still in effect today the treatment of armenians in turkey the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline and the armenian claim of turkeys holding of historic armenian lands ceded to them in the  a treaty which armenia uses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the soviet union and turkey and not between armenia and turkey proper at the foront of all disputes however is the issue surrounding the armenian genocide the killing and deportation of between one and one and a half million armenians from the  orchestrated by the  is a taboo subject in turkey itself as the turkish government uses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened however since turkey has become a candidate to join the european union limited discussion of the event is now taking place in turkey some in the european parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for turkey to join the eu should be the full recognition of the event as genocide
on 5 june 2005 armenian president robert kocharian announced that he was ready to continue dialogue with azerbaijan for the settlement of the nagorno karabakh conflict and with turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions  armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the  it is loyal to the treaty of kars and all agreements inherited by the former soviet armenian government  yet turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations insisting that armenia abandon its efforts to have the genocide recognized which official  is not willing to do
in the wake of the  between russia and georgia armenia and turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship according to  magazine 70% of armenias imports enter via georgia because of the apparently belligerent posture of the russian state economic ties with turkey appear especially attractiveturkey and armenia friends and neighbors rising hopes of better relations between two historic enemies the economist 27 september 2008 p 67

following al farabis lead avicenna initiated a full fledged inquiry into the question of being in which he distinguished between essence mahiat and existence wujud he argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things existence must theore be due to an  that necessitates imparts gives or adds existence to an essence to do so the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect name islam in britannica 
avicennas consideration of the essence attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being namely impossibility contingency and necessity avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist while the contingent in itself mumkin bi dhatihi has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction when actualized the contingent becomes a necessary existent due to what is other than itself wajib al wujud bi ghayrihi thus contingency in itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself the metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different necessary being due to itself wajib al wujud bi dhatihi is true in itself while the contingent being is false in itself and true due to something else other than itself the necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence it is what always existsavicenna kitab al shifa metaphysics ii eds g c anawati ibrahim madkour said zayed cairo 1975 p 36  avicenna and essentialism review of metaphysics vol 54 2001 ppampnbsp753–778

there are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion he did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory if prophecy could be questioned and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly without digressing to consider  matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophersjames w morris 1992 the philosopher prophet in avicennas political philosophy in c butterworth ed the political aspects of islamic philosophy chapter 4 cambridge  pp152–198 ppampnbsp160–161 
later interpretations of avicennas philosophy split into three different schools those such as  who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances those such as  who considered avicennas theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns and those such as  who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means it was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al razi which eventually came to predominate in the james w morris 1992 the philosopher prophet in avicennas political philosophy in c butterworth ed the political aspects of islamic philosophy chapter 4 cambridge  pp152–198 ppampnbsp156–158

while he was imprisoned in the castle of fardajan near hamadhan avicenna wrote his famous    literally falling man    to demonstrate human  and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul avicenna believed his floating man thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input the thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air isolated from all  which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies he argued that in this scenario one would still have  because it is conceivable that a person suspended in air while cut off from  would still be capable of determining his own existence the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection independent of the body and an immaterial substance the conceivability of this floating man indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually which entails the souls separateness from the body avicenna erred to the living human  particularly the  which he believed to be the  by which god communicates  to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to  following is an english translation of the argument
however avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation  sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal agent intellect the first knowledge of the flying person would be i am affirming his or her essence  that essence could not be the body obviously as the flying person has no sensation thus the knowledge that i am is the core of a human being  the soul exists and is self aware  avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the  is not logically dependent on any physical  and that the soul should not be seen in s but as a primary given a  the body is unnecessary in relation to it the soul is its perfection name nader el bizri 2000 pp 149 171  name elbizri67 89    in itself the soul is an immaterial substance

the theory of motion presented by avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th century alexandrian scholar  avicennas is a less sophisticated variant of the  developed by  in the 14th century it is unclear if buridan was influenced by avicenna or by philoponus directly

avicennas psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the souls individuation but weak enough to allow for its immortality avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception thus the philosophers connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception in this way bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect in sense perception the perceiver senses the form of the object first by perceiving features of the object by our external senses this sensory information is supplied to the internal senses which merge all the pieces into a whole unified conscious experience this process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body for the material body may only perceive material objects while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial universal forms the way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction which takes place in the physical body 
the soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter this process requires a concrete particular material to be abstracted into the universal intelligible immaterial the material and immaterial interact through the active intellect which is a divine light containing the intelligible forms   the active intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes color available to our eyes

the treatises of ibn sīnā influenced later muslim thinkers in many areas including theology philology mathematics astronomy physics and music his works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects of which around 240 have survived in particular 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine name mactutor biography id avicenna   
his most famous works are the book of healing and the canon of medicine
ibn sīnā wrote at least one treatise on alchemy but several others have been falsely attributed to him  his logic metaphysics physics and de caelo are treatises giving a synoptic view of  though  metaphysics demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of  known as aristotelianism in ibn sīnās world 
arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that ibn sīnā was attempting to re aristotelianise muslim philosophy in its entirety unlike his predecessors who accepted the conflation of platonic aristotelian neo  and middle platonic works transmitted into the muslim world
the logic and metaphysics have been extensively reprinted the latter eg at venice in 1493 1495 and 1546 some of his shorter essays on medicine logic etc take a poetical form the poem on logic was published by schmoelders in 1836 two encyclopaedic treatises dealing with philosophy are often mentioned the larger  sanatio exists nearly complete in manuscript in the  and elsewhere part of it on the de anima appeared at pavia 1490 as the liber sextus naturalium and the long account of ibn sinas philosophy given by  seems to be mainly an analysis and in many places a reproduction of the al shifa a shorter form of the work is known as the an najat liberatio the latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied there is also a  hikmat al mashriqqiyya in latin philosophia orientalis mentioned by  the majority of which is lost in antiquity which according to averroes was pantheistic in tone

the ashes is a  series played between  and  the ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the test series
the term originated in a satirical obituary published in a british newspaper  immediately after australias  at  their first test win on english soil the obituary stated that english cricket had died and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to australia  the mythical ashes immediately became associated with the  before which the english captain  had vowed to regain those ashes the english media theore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the ashes
after england had won two of the three tests on the tour a small urn was presented to bligh by a group of melbourne women including  whom bligh married within a year name eventshttp  trovenlagovau ndp del article 63185850 summary of events  20 february 1884 foot of column 2 at   the contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden  and were humorously described as the ashes of australian crickethttp  trovenlagovau ndp del article 12673335 cricket  4 june 1908 p8 at   it is not clear whether that tiny silver urn is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the  by blighs widow after his death in 1927
 has never been the official trophy of the ashes series having been a personal gift to bligh  however s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an ashes series since the  a  representation of the ashes urn called the ashes trophy has been presented to the winners of an ashes series as the official trophy of that series whichever side holds the ashes the urn remains in the mcc museum at  it has however been taken to australia to be put on touring display on two occasions as part of the  celebrations in 1988 and to accompany the 
an ashes series is traditionally of five tests hosted in turn by england and australia at least once every four years  england hold the ashes having won three of the five tests in the  overall australia has won 32 series england 32 and five series have been drawn
the first  between england and australia was played in  australia  though the ashes legend started later after the ninth test played in 1882 on their  that year the australians played just one test at  in london it was a low scoring affair on a difficult fred spofforth however contended that the fourth innings aside it played perfectly well  australia made a mere 63 runs in its first  and england led by  took a 38 run lead with a total of 101 in their second innings the australians boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from  managed 122 which left england only 85 runs to win the australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second innings collapse but fast bowler  spurred on by the  of his opponents in particular  used to give in this thing can be done he declared spofforth went on to devastate the english batting taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave england just eight runs short of victory
when  englands last batsman came to the crease his side needed just ten runs to win but peate managed only two before he was bowled by  an astonished oval crowd fell silent struggling to believe that england could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil when it finally sank in the crowd swarmed onto the field cheering loudly and chairing boyle and spofforth to the pavilion
when peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner  one of the best batsman in england having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists to get the runs peate humorously replied i had no confidence in mr studd sir so thought i had better do my best
 
the momentous defeat was widely recorded in the british press which praised the australians for their plentiful pluck and berated the englishmen for their lack thereof a celebrated poem appeared in  on saturday 9 september the first verse quoted most frequently reads

 promised that on  he would as englands captain recover those ashes he spoke of them several times over the course of the tour and the australian media quickly caught on the three match series resulted in a two one win to england notwithstanding a fourth match won by the australians whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute
in the 20 years following blighs campaign the term the ashes largely disappeared from public use there is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series at least not in england the term became popular again in australia first when  in his memoirs with bat and ball 1899 used the term as if it were well knowngibson a cricket captains of england p 26 
the true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903 when  took a team to australia with the promise that he would regain the ashes as had been the case on blighs tour 20 years before the australian media latched fervently onto the term and this time it stuck having fulfilled his promise warner published a book entitled how we recovered the ashes although the origins of the term are not erred to in the text the title served along with the general hype created in australia to revive public interest in the legend the first mention of the ashes in  occurs in 1905 while wisdens first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition
as it took many years for the name the ashes to be given to ongoing series between england and australia there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners as late as 1925 the following verse appeared in the cricketers annual

nevertheless several attempts had been made to embody the ashes in a physical memorial examples include one presented to warner in 1904 another to australian captain m a noble in 1909 and another to australian captain w m woodfull in 1934
the oldest and the one to enjoy enduring fame was the one presented to bligh later lord darnley during the 1882–83 tour the precise nature of the origin of  is matter of dispute based on a statement by darnley in 1894 it was believed that a group of  ladies including darnleys later wife  made the presentation after the victory in the third test in 1883 more recent researchers in particular ronald willis  and joy munns  have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over christmas 1882 when the english team were guests of  at his property  in  this was before the matches had started the prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of clarke
in august 1926 ivo bligh now lord darnley displayed the ashes urn at the  decorative art exhibition held in the central hall westminster he made the following statement about how he was given the urn 
a more detailed account of how the ashes were given to ivo bligh was outlined by his wife the countess of darnley in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon her speech was reported by the london times as followsthe times london 27 june 1930 page 7 
there is another statement which is not totally clear made by lord darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn he was interviewed in his home at cobham hall by montague grover and the report of this interview was as follows 
he made a similar statement in 1926 the report of this statement in the brisbane courier was as follows 
the contents of the urn are also problematic they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump bail or the outer casing of a ball but in 1998 darnleys 82 year old daughter in law said they were the remains of her mother in laws veil casting a further layer of doubt on the matter however during the tour of australia in 2006 7 the mcc official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted and it was now 95% certain that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail speaking on channel nine tv on 25 november 2006 he said x rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked and repair work had to be carried out the urn is made of  and is about  tall and may originally have been a perfume jar
a label containing a six line verse is pasted on the urn this is the fourth verse of a song lyric published in the  on 1 february 1883

when  goes back with the urn the urn

 poem blockquote
in february 1883 just before the disputed fourth test a velvet bag made by mrs ann fletcher the daughter of joseph hines clarke and marion wright both of  was given to bligh to contain the urn
during darnleys lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921   published this photo in january 1921 shown above
when darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the  and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes mcc first displayed the urn in the long room at  and since 1953 in the mcc cricket museum at the ground mccs wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy
it is in fact a private memento and for this reason it is never awarded to either england or australia but is kept permanently in the mcc cricket museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match
because the urn itself is so delicate it has been allowed to travel to australia only twice the first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the  celebrations the second was for the 2006 7 ashes series  the urn arrived on 17 october 2006 going on display at the  it then toured to other states with the final appearance at the tasmanian museum and art gallery on 21 january 2007
in the 1990s given australias long dominance of the ashes and the popular acceptance of the darnley urn as the ashes the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series as its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the mcc cricket museum the mcc would not agree furthermore in 2002 blighs great great grandson lord clifton the heir apparent to the  argued that the ashes urn should not be returned to australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the mcc only for safe keeping
as a compromise the mcc commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in  to award to the winning team of each series from 1998–99 this is known as the ashes trophyhttp  wwwlordsorg news our blogs the cricket history blog what is the ashes trophy  what is the ashes trophy lords website retrieved 1 september 2013  this did little to diminish the status of the darnley urn as the most important icon in cricket the symbol of this old and keenly fought contest

later in 1882 following the famous australian victory at the oval  led an england team to australia as he said to recover those ashes publicity surrounding the series was intense and it was at some time during this series that the ashes urn was crafted australia won the first test by  but in the next two england were victorious at the end of the third test england were generally considered to have won back the ashes 2–1 a fourth match was played against a united australian xi which was arguably stronger than the australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches this game however is not generally considered part of the 1882–83 series it is counted as a test but as a standalone this match ended in a victory for australia
after blighs victory there was an extended period of english dominance the tours generally had fewer tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years the first five test series taking place only in 1894–95 england lost only four ashes tests in the 1880s out of 23 played and they won all the seven series contested
there was more chopping and changing in the teams given that there was no official board of selectors for each country in 1887–88 two separate english teams were on tour in australia and popularity with the fans varied the 1890s games were more closely fought australia taking their first series win since 1882 with a 2–1 victory in 1891–92 but england dominated winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes
the  series began in sensational fashion when england won the first test at sydney by just 10 runs having followed on australia had scored a massive 586  201  161 and then dismissed england for 325 but england responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed australia for 166 with  taking 6 for 67 at the close of the second last days play australia were 113–2 needing only 64 more runs but heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left arm bowlers peel and  were all but unplayable england went on to win the series 3–2 after it had been all square before the final test which england won by 6 wickets the english heroes were peel with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 2670 and  with 32 at 2653
in 1896 england under the captaincy of  won the series 2–1 and this marked the end of englands longest period of ashes dominance
australia resoundingly won the 1897–98 series by 4–1 under the captaincy of  his successor  won the next three series in 1899 1901–02 and the  which became one of the most famous in the history of test cricket

the period of darlings captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding australian players such as trumper      and 
after what the  saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves and this led to the first mcc tour of australia in 1903–04 england won it against the odds and  the england captain wrote up his version of the tour in his book how we recovered the ashes how we recovered the ashes longman 1905  the title of this book revived the ashes legend and it was after this that england v australia series were customarily erred to as the ashes
england and australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the first world war in 1914 five more series took place between 1905 and 1912 in 1905 englands captain  not only won the series 2–0 but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages monty noble led australia to victory in both 1907–08 and 1909 then england won in 1911–12 by four matches to one  establishing himself as englands first choice opening batsman with three centuries while  32 wickets at 2162 and  34 wickets at 2288 formed a formidable bowling partnership

after the war australia took firm control of both the ashes and world cricket for the first time the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as  and  crippled the english batting on a regular basis australia recorded overwhelming victories both in england and on home soil they won the first eight matches in succession including a 5–0  in  at the hands of warwick armstrongs team
the ruthless and belligerent armstrong led his team back to england in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of england without defeat
england won only one test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925harte pp 274–276  name auslist 
in a rain hit series in 1926 england managed to eke out a 1–0 victory with a win in the final test at the oval because the series was at stake the match was to be timeless ie played to a finish australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22 jack hobbs and  took the score to 49–0 at the end of the second day a lead of 27 heavy rain fell overnight and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket england seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match in spite of the very difficult batting conditions however hobbs and sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before hobbs was out for exactly 100 sutcliffe went on to make 161 and england won the game comfortablyharte pp 298–301  australian captain  was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level and some accused him of throwing the match
australias ageing post war team broke up after 1926 with collins  and  all departing and gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928–29 series
despite the debut of  the inexperienced australians led by  were heavily defeated losing 4–1harte pp 312–316  england had a very strong batting side with  contributing 905 runs at an average of 11312 and hobbs sutcliffe and  all scoring heavily the bowling was more than adequate without being outstanding
in 1930  led an extremely inexperienced team to england
bradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 13914 which remains a world record test series aggregate a modest bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying i have always endeavoured to do my best for the side and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches my one idea when going into bat was to make runs for australia name don bradman on australianscreen online  in the  test he made 334 reaching 309 at the end of the first day including a century before lunch bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match at  was a better innings england managed to stay in contention until the deciding final test at the oval but yet another double hundred by bradman and 7 92 by  in englands second innings enabled australia to win by an innings and take the series 2–1 s 29 wickets at 3189 for australia in this high scoring series were also important
australia had one of the strongest batting line ups ever in the early 1930s with bradman    and  it was the prospect of bowling at this line up that caused englands 1932–33 captain  to adopt the tactic of fast  better known as 
jardine instructed his  most notably  and  to bowl at the bodies of the australian batsmen with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats thus providing easy catches to a stacked  field jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it leg theory but it was widely disparaged by its opponents who dubbed it bodyline from on the line of the body although england decisively won the ashes 4–1 bodyline caused such a furore in australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to anglo australian relations and the  eventually changed the  to curtail the number of leg side fielders
jardines comment was ive not travelled 6000 miles to make friends im here to win the ashes 
some of the australians wanted to use bodyline in retaliation but woodfull flatly used he famously told england manager  there are two teams out there one is playing cricket the other is making no attempt to do so after the latter had come into the australian rooms to express sympathy for a larwood bouncer had struck the australian skipper in the heart and felled himcashman franks maxwell sainsbury stoddart weaver webster 1997 the a z of australian cricketers pp 322–323 
on the batting friendly  that prevailed in the late 1930s most tests up to the second world war still gave results it should be borne in mind that tests in australia prior to the war were all played to a finish many batting records were set in this period
the 1934 ashes series began with the notable absence of larwood voce and jardine the mcc had made it clear in light of the revelations of the bodyline series that these players would not face australia it should be noted that the mcc although it had earlier condoned and encouraged  bodyline tactics in the 1932–33 series laid the blame on larwood when relations turned sour larwood was forced by the mcc to either apologise or be removed from the test side he went for the latter
australia recovered the ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953 though no test cricket was played during the second world war
as in 1930 the 1934 series was decided in the final test at the oval australia batting first posted a massive 701 in the first innings bradman 244 and ponsford 266 were in record breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket england eventually faced a massive 707 run target for victory and failed australia winning the series 2–1harte pp 356–357  this made woodfull the only captain to regain the ashes and he retired upon his return to australia
in 1936–37 bradman succeeded woodfull as australian captain he started badly losing the first two tests heavily after australia were caught on s however the australians fought back and bradman won his first series in charge 3–2
the 1938 series was a high scoring affair with two high scoring draws resulting in a 1–1 result australia retaining the ashes after the first two matches ended in stalemate and the third test at old trafford never started due to rain australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low scoring match at headingley to retain the urn in the timeless fifth test at the oval the highlight was s then world record score of 364 as england made 903 7 declared bradman and  injured themselves during huttons marathon effort and with only nine men australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runshttp  newsbbccouk sport2 hi cricket england 6109836stm classic ashes clashes   1938 the oval at  5 november 2006 accessed 4 march 2006  the heaviest in test history
the ashes resumed after the war when england toured in 1946–47 and as in 1920–21 found that australia had made the better post war recovery still captained by bradman and now featuring the potent new ball partnership of  and  australia were convincing 3–0 winners
aged 38 and having been unwell during the war bradman had been reluctant to play he batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to  england believed it was a catch but bradman stood his ground believing it to be a bump ball the umpire ruled in the australian captains favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear scoring 187 australia promptly seized the initiative won the first test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post war era the controversy over the ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era
in 1948 australia set new standards completely outplaying their hosts to win 4–0 with one draw this  led by bradman who turned 40 during his final tour of england has gone down in history as the invincibles playing 34 matches on tour—three of which were not first class—and including the five tests they remained unbeaten winning 27 and drawing 7
bradmans men were greeted by packed crowds across the country and records for test attendances in england were set in the  and  at lords and headingley respectively before a record attendance of spectators at headingley australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven wicket victory
the 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history as bradman played his final innings for australia in the  at the oval needing to score only four runs to end with a career  of exactly 100 however bradman made a second ball duck bowled by an  googlyhttp  newsbbccouk sport2 hi cricket 8036237stm 1948   bradmans final innings duck at  27 may 2009 accessed 4 march 2015  that sent him into retirement with a career average of 9994
bradman was succeeded as australian captain by  who led the team to a 4–1 series victory in 1950–51 the series was not as one sided as the number of wins suggest with several tight matches
the tide finally turned in 1953 when england won the final test at the oval to take the series 1–0 having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding test at headingley this was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in english cricket history with players such as captain len hutton batsmen     bowlers      wicket keeper  and all rounder

englands dominance was not to last australia won 4–0 in 1958–59 having found a high quality spinner of their own in new skipper  who took 31 wickets in the five test series and paceman  who took 24 wickets at 1900 the series was overshadowed by the furore over various australian bowlers most notably  whom the english management and media accused of  australia to victory
australia consolidated their status as the leading team in world cricket with a hard fought 2–1 away series after narrowly winning the second test at lords dubbed the battle of the ridge because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the fourth test at old trafford and sealed the series after a heavy collapse during the english runchase
the tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s held in 1962–63 1964 1965–66 and 1968 the powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement and their replacements were of lesser quality making it more difficult to force a result england failed to win any series during the 1960s a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing of the 20 tests played during the four series australia won four and england three as they held the ashes australian captains  and  were happy to adopt safety first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws during this period spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased but simpson and lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction
it was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of england and australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time west indies defeated england twice in the mid 1960s and south africa in two series before they were banned for  completely outplayed australia 3–1 and 4–0 australia had lost 2–1 during a tour of the west indies in 1964–65 the first time they had lost a series to any team other than england

with greig having joined wsc england appointed  as their captain and he enjoyed great success against australia largely assisted by the return of boycott brearleys men won the 1977 series 3–0 and then completed an overwhelming 5–1 series win against an australian side missing its wsc players in 1978–79  made his test debut for australia in 1978–79

australia reached a cricketing peak in the 1990s and early 2000s coupled with a general decline in englands fortunes after re establishing its credibility in 1989 australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990–91 1993 1994–95 1997 1998–99 2001 and 2002–03 series all by convincing margins
great australian players in the early years included batsmen border boon taylor and steve waugh the captaincy passed from border to taylor in the mid 1990s and then to steve waugh before the 2001 series in the latter part of the 1990s waugh himself along with his twin brother  scored heavily for australia and fast bowlers  and  made a serious impact especially the former the wicketkeeper batsman position was held by  for most of the 1990s and by  from 2001 to 2006–07 in the 2000s batsmen   and  became noted players for australia but the most dominant australian player was leg spinner  whose first delivery in ashes cricket in 1993 to dismiss mike gatting became known as the 
australias record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides before the 1989 series began the win loss ratio was almost even with 87 test wins for australia to englands 86 74 tests having been drawn  by the 2005 series australias test wins had increased to 115 whereas englands had increased to only 93 with 82 draws  in the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series the two sides had played 43 times australia winning 28 times england 7 times with 8 draws only a single england victory had come in a match in which the ashes were still at stake namely the first test of the 1997 series all others were consolation victories when the ashes had been secured by australia 
england were undefeated in test matches through the 2004 calendar year this elevated them to second in the  hopes that the  would be closely fought proved well founded the series remaining undecided as the closing session of the final test began experienced journalists including richie benaud rated the series as the most exciting in living memory it has been compared with the great series of the distant past such as 1894–95 and 1902
the first test at  was convincingly won by australia but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and england fought back to win the second test by 2 runs the smallest winning margin in ashes history and the second smallest in all tests the rain affected third test ended with the last two australian batsmen holding out for a draw and england won the fourth test by three wickets after forcing australia to  for the first time in 191 tests being a period of 17 years a draw in the final test gave england victory in an ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first ashes victory at home since 1985

the term became further genericised in australia in the first half of the twentieth century and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of australia vs england the   and the small silver casket which served as its trophy were symbolically known as the ashes of australian football  and was spoken of as such until at least the 1940s  the soccer rivalry between australia and new zealand was described as the soccer ashes of australasia until as late as the 1950s  ashes from cigars smoked by the two countries captains were put into a casket in 1923 to make the trophy literal  the interstate   was known for a time as australias rugby league ashes and  competitions between the two states also regularly used the term  even some local rivalries such southern western australias annual great southern football carnival were locally described as the ashes  this genericised usage is no longer common and the ashes would today be assumed only to apply to a contest between australia and england
the ashes featured in the film  released in 1953 based on a television play by  it stars  as an england cricketer playing the last test of his career which is the last of an ashes series the film includes cameo appearances of english captain  and other players  who were part of englands 1953 triumph

the terms synthesis and analysis are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic in ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have the oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in  appended to  xiii 5 which in all probability was framed by  analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it

the analytic method is not conclusive unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible to remove all doubt the greeks as a rule added to the analytic process a synthetic one consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions

the synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths an analytic proof begins by an assumption upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded the greeks distinguished theoretic from problematic analysis a theoretic analysis is of the following kind to prove that a is b assume first that a is b if so then since b is c and c is d and d is e theore a is e if this be known a falsity a is not b but if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be  then the reverse process a is e e is d d is c c is b theore a is b constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition the problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem

abner doubleday june 26 1819 – january 26 1893 was a career  officer and  general in the  he fired the first shot in defense of  the opening battle of the war and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the  gettysburg was his finest hour but his relief by   caused lasting enmity between the two men in  after the war he obtained a patent on the  railway that still runs there in his final years in  he was a prominent member and later president of the  doubleday has been historically credited with  although this appears to be untrue name kirschxiiixivkirsch pp xiii xiv  
doubleday the son of  and hester donnelly was born in  in a small house on the corner of washington and fenwick streets as a child abner was very short the family all slept in the attic loft of the one room house his paternal grandfather also named abner had fought in the  his maternal grandfather joined the army at 14 and was a mounted messenger for  his father ulysses f doubleday fought in the  published newspapers and books and represented  for four years in the  name beckenbaughbeckenbaugh pp 611 12  abner spent his childhood in auburn and later was sent to  to live with his uncle and attend a private preparatory high school he practiced as a surveyor and civil engineer for two years before entering the  name taggtagg pp 25 27  in 1838 he graduated in 1842 24th in a class of 56 cadets and was commissioned a   in the 3rd us artillery name eichereicher p 213  in 1852 he married mary hewitt of  name txhttp  wwwtshaonlineorg handbook online articles fdo39 texas handbook 
doubleday initially served in coastal garrisons and then in the  from 1846 to 1848 and the  from 1856 to 1858  in 1858 he was transferred to  in  serving under colonel  by the start of the civil war he was a  and second in command in the garrison at  under   name beckenbaugh  he aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the  bombardment on april 12 1861 he subsequently erred to himself as the hero of sumter for this role name tagg 
doubleday was promoted to major on may 14 1861 and commanded the artillery department in the  from june to august and then the artillery for  s division of the  he was appointed  of volunteers on february 3 1862 and was assigned to duty in northern virginia while the army of the potomac conducted the  his first combat assignment was to lead the 2nd brigade 1st division  of the  during the  in the actions at brawners farm just before the  he took the initiative to send two of his regiments to reinforce brigadier general s brigade against a larger confederate force fighting it to a standstill personal initiative was required since his division commander brig gen  was incapacitated by an  seizure at the time he was replaced by brigadier general langellier pp 43 45 49  his men were routed when they encountered major general s corps but by the following day august 30 he took command of the division when hatch was wounded and he led his men to cover the retreat of the union army name tagg 
doubleday again led the division now assigned to the  of the army of the potomac after  where hatch was wounded again at  he led his men into the deadly fighting in the cornfield and the west woods and one colonel described him as a gallant officer  remarkably cool and at the very front of battle name tagg  he was wounded when an artillery shell exploded near his horse throwing him to the ground in a violent fall he received a brevet promotion to  in the  for his actions at antietam and was promoted in march 1863 to  of volunteers to rank from november 29 1862eicher p 703  at  in december 1862 his division mostly sat idle during the winter the i corps was reorganized and doubleday assumed command of the 3rd division at  in may 1863 the division was kept in reserve name tagg 
at the start of the  july 1 1863 doubledays division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of brigadier general  when his corps commander major general  was killed very early in the fighting doubleday found himself in command of the corps at 1050 am his men fought well in the morning putting up a stout resistance but as overwhelming confederate forces massed against them their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of  to the relative safety of  south of town it was doubledays finest performance during the war five hours leading 9500 men against ten confederate brigades that numbered more than 16000 seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent indicating the ferocity of the union defense on cemetery hill however the i corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle it would be decommissioned in march 1864 its surviving units consolidated into other corps name tagg 
on july 2 1863 army of the potomac commander maj gen  replaced doubleday with major general  a more junior officer from another corps the ostensible reason was a false report by  commander major general  that doubledays corps broke first causing the entire union line to collapse but meade also had a long history of disdain for doubledays combat effectiveness dating back to south mountain doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against meade but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle name tagg  he was wounded in the neck on the second day of gettysburg and received a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service name eicher  he formally requested reinstatement as i corps commander but meade used and doubleday left gettysburg on july 7 for washingtoncoddington pp 690 91 
doubledays indecision as a commander in the war resulted in his uncomplimentary nickname forty eight hours name eicher 
doubleday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of  where he was in charge of courts martial which gave him legal experience that he used after the war his only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by confederate   in the  also while in washington doubleday testified against george meade at the  criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the battle of gettysburg name beckenbaugh  while in washington doubleday remained a loyal  and staunch supporter of president  doubleday rode with lincoln on the train to gettysburg for the  and col and mrs doubleday attended events with mr and mrs lincoln in washington
after the civil war doubleday mustered out of the volunteer service on august 24 1865 reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and became the colonel of the 35th us infantry in september 1867 he was stationed in  from 1869 through 1871 and he took out a patent for the  railway that still runs there receiving a charter for its operation but signing away his rights when he was reassigned in 1871 he commanded the  an all african american regiment with headquarters at   name tx  he retired in 1873
in the 1870s he was listed in the new york business directory as lawyer
doubleday spent much of his time writing he published two important works on the civil war reminiscences of forts sumter and moultrie 1876 and chancellorsville and gettysburg 1882 the latter being a volume of the series campaigns of the civil war name eicher 
in the summer of 1878 doubleday lived in  and became a prominent member of the  when two of the founders of that society  and  moved to india at the end of that year he was constituted as the president of the american body another prominent member was gomes http  wwwtheosocietyorg pasadena sunrise 40 90 1 th tsgomhtm theosophy article 
doubleday died of heart disease doubledays body was laid in state in new yorks city hall and then was taken to washington by train name tagg  from mendham township and is buried in  in arlington virginia name eicher 
although doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important civil war battles he is more widely remembered as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball in s cow pasture in  in 1839
the  chaired by  the fourth president of the  was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball the committees final report on december 30 1907 stated in part that the first scheme for playing baseball according to the best evidence obtainable to date was devised by abner doubleday at cooperstown new york in 1839 it concluded by saying in the years to come in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball and the millions who will be abner doubledays fame will rest evenly if not quite as much upon the fact that he was its inventor  as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the federal armykirsch pp xiii 
however there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim baseball historian george b kirsch has described the results of the mills commission as a myth he wrote robert henderson harold seymour and other scholars have since debunked the doubleday cooperstown myth which nonetheless remains powerful in the american imagination because of the efforts of major league baseball and the hall of fame in cooperstown at his death doubleday left many letters and papers none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game and his new york times obituary did not mention the game at all chairman mills himself who had been a civil war colleague of doubleday and a member of the honor guard for doubledays body as it lay in state in new york city never recalled hearing doubleday describe his role as the inventor doubleday was a cadet at west point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from cooperstown the prior year furthermore the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to doubleday was that of abner graves whose credibility is questionable a few years later he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life name kirschxiiixiv  part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in cooperstown in 1839morris peter but didnt we have fun ivan r dee publishing 2008 
despite the lack of solid evidence linking doubleday to the origins of baseball cooperstown new york became the new home of what is today the  in 1937
there may have been some relationship to the baseball as a national sport and abner doubleday  while the modern rules of baseball were formulated in new york during the 1840s it was the scattering of new yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country that spread not only baseball but also the new york rules thereby harmonizing the rules and being a catalyst for its growth  doubleday was a high ranking officer whose duties included seeing to provisions for the us army fighting throughout the south and border states  for the morale of the men he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the menbatsballs and bullets essay by george b kirsch civil war times illustrated may 1998 pages 30 37

amplitude modulation am is a  technique used in electronic communication most commonly for transmitting information via a   in amplitude modulation the  signal strength of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted  that waveform may for instance correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a  or the light intensity of television pixels  this technique contrasts with  in which the  of the  is varied and  in which its  is varied
am was the earliest modulation method used to transmit voice by radio it was developed during the first two decades of the 20th century beginning with roberto landell de moura and s  experiments in 1900http  wwwaminharadiocom radio files artigo revista pcp usapdf   it remains in use today in many forms of communication for example it is used in portable s   and in computer s am is often used to er to  
in  and   means varying some aspect of a higher frequency   with an information bearing modulation waveform such as an  which represents sound or a  which represents images so the carrier will carry the information  when it reaches its destination the information signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by 
in amplitude modulation the  or strength of the carrier oscillations is what is varied  for example in am radio communication a  radio frequency signal a al  has its   by an audio waveform before transmission     the audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the  of the waveform in the  amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the  and two adjacent s each sideband is equal in  to that of the modulating signal and is a mirror image of the other standard am is thus sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation dsb am to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on am
one disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques not only standard am is that the receiver amplifies and detects  and  in equal proportion to the signal increasing the received  say by a factor of 10 a 10  improvement thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10 this is in contrast to   fm and  where the effect of such noise following  is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception for this reason am broadcast is not favored for music and  broadcasting but rather for voice communications and broadcasts sports news  etc
another disadvantage of am is that it is inefficient in power usage at least two thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal  the carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted voice video data etc  however its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using  providing a frequency and phase erence to extract the modulation from the sidebands  in some modulation systems based on am a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly the receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency usually as shifted to the  from a greatly reduced pilot carrier in  or dsb rc to use in the demodulation process even with the carrier totally eliminated in  carrier regeneration is possible using a  this doesnt work however for  ssb sc leading to the characteristic donald duck sound from such receivers when slightly detuned single sideband is nevertheless used widely in  and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency cutting the rf bandwidth in half compared to standard am on the other hand in  and  broadcasting standard am with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers the broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience
an additional function provided by the carrier in standard am but which is lost in either single or double sideband suppressed carrier transmission is that it provides an amplitude erence in the receiver the  agc responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation on the other hand with suppressed carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation so the agc must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation this typically involves a so called fast attack slow decay circuit which holds the agc level for a second or more following such peaks in between syllables or short pauses in the program this is very acceptable for communications radios where  of the audio aids intelligibility however it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming where a faithful reproduction of the original program including its varying modulation levels is expected
a trivial form of am which can be used for transmitting  is  the simplest form of  in which  are represented by the presence or absence of a carrier on off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit  where it is known as  cw operation even though the transmission is not strictly continuous

although am was used in a few crude experiments in multiplex telegraph and telephone transmission in the late 1800s name bray  the practical development of amplitude modulation is synonymous with the development between 1900 and 1920 of  transmission that is the effort to send sound audio by radio waves  the first radio transmitters called s transmitted information by  using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in   they couldnt transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of s pulses of radio waves that declined to zero that sounded like a buzz in receivers  in effect they were already amplitude modulated
the first am transmission was made by canadian researcher  on 23 december 1900 using a  with a specially designed high frequency 10ampnbspkhz  over a distance of 1 mile 16ampnbspkm at cobb island maryland usa   his first transmitted words were hello one two three four  is it snowing where you are mr thiessen  the words were barely intelligible above the background buzz of the spark
fessenden was a significant figure in the development of am radio  he was one of the first researchers to realize from experiments like the above that the existing technology for producing radio waves the spark transmitter was not usable for amplitude modulation and that a new kind of transmitter one that produced  s was needed  this was a radical idea at the time because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves and fessenden was ridiculed   he invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters   the  with which he made what is considered the first am public entertainment broadcast on christmas eve 1906  he also discovered the principle on which am modulation is based  and invented one of the first s able to  and receive am the electrolytic detector or liquid baretter in 1902  other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy such as the  1904 and the  1906 also proved able to rectify am signals so the technological hurdle was generating am waves receiving them was not a problem
early experiments in am radio transmission conducted by fessenden valdamar poulsen ernst ruhmer  charles harrold and  were hampered by the lack of a technology for   the first practical continuous wave am s  were based on either the huge expensive  developed 1906 1910 or versions of the  transmitter arc converter invented in 1903  the modifications necessary to transmit am were clumsy and resulted in  very low quality audio  modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon  inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna  the limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones many of the microphones were water cooled
the discovery in 1912 of the amplifying ability of the   invented in 1906 by  solved these problems  the vacuum tube  invented in 1912 by  and  was a cheap source of s and could be easily  to make an am transmitter  modulation did not have to be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube so the microphone or other audio source didnt have to handle high power  wartime research greatly advanced the art of am modulation and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with am transmission of news or music  the vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of  around 1920 the first electronic  medium  amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for  until  began after world war 2
at the same time as am radio began  such as  were developing the other large application for am sending multiple telephone calls through a single wire by modulating them on separate  frequencies called  name bray  
john renshaw carson in 1915 did the first mathematical analysis of amplitude modulation showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal name bray    his analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal and carson patented  ssb on 1 december 1915 name bray   this more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by atampt for  transatlantic telephone service beginning 7 january 1927  after ww2 it was developed by the military for aircraft communication
consider a carrier wave sine wave of frequency fsubc sub and amplitude a given by
mathct   a\cdot \sin2 \pi f_c t\ math
let mt represent the modulation waveform for this example we shall take the modulation to be simply a sine wave of a frequency fsubm sub a much lower frequency such as an audio frequency than fsubc sub
mathmt   m\cdot \cos2 \pi f_m t + \phi\ math
where m is the amplitude of the modulation we shall insist that m1 so that 1+mt is always positive if m1 then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal amplitude modulation results when the carrier ct is multiplied by the positive quantity  1+mt
{ 
 mathyt\ math
 math  1 + mt\cdot ct \ math
  
 
 math  1 + m\cdot \cos2 \pi f_m t + \phi \cdot a \cdot \sin2 \pi f_c t math
 }
in this simple case m is identical to the  discussed below with m 05 the amplitude modulated signal yt thus corresponds to the top graph labelled 50% modulation in figure 4
using  yt can be shown to be the sum of three sine waves
mathyt   a\cdot \sin2 \pi f_c t + \begin{matrix}\frac{am}{2} \end{matrix} \left\sin2 \pi f_c + f_m t + \phi + \sin2 \pi f_c   f_m t   \phi\right\ math
theore the modulated signal has three components the carrier wave ct which is unchanged and two pure sine waves known as s with frequencies slightly above and below the carrier frequency fsubc sub
of course a useful modulation signal mt will generally not consist of a single sine wave as treated above however by the principle of  mt can be expressed as the sum of a number of sine waves of various frequencies amplitudes and phases carrying out the multiplication of  1+mt with ct as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves again the carrier ct is present unchanged but for each frequency component of m at fsubi sub there are two sidebands at frequencies fsubc sub + fsubi sub and  fsubc sub   fsubi sub the collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband and those below constitute the lower sideband in a slightly different way of looking at it we can consider the modulation mt to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components as results from a formal  of a real valued quantity as shown in the top of fig 2 then one can view the sidebands as that modulation mt having simply been shifted in frequency by fsubc sub as depicted at the bottom right of fig 2 formally the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies shown at the bottom left of fig 2 for completeness
if we just look at the short term spectrum of modulation changing as it would for a human voice for instance then we can plot the frequency content horizontal axis as a function of time vertical axis as in fig 3 it can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency and the same content mirror imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency at all times the carrier itself remains constant and of greater power than the total sideband power
the rf bandwidth of an am transmission er to figure 2 but only considering positive frequencies is twice the bandwidth of the modulating or  signal since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency although the bandwidth of an am signal is narrower than one using  fm it is twice as wide as  techniques it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient within a frequency band only half as many transmissions or channels can thus be accommodated for this reason television employs a variant of single sideband known as  somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth in order to reduce the required channel spacing
another improvement over standard am is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum in figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands even with full 100% sine wave modulation the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands yet it carries no unique information thus there is a great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband  or with both sidebands remaining  while these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power they require more sophisticated receivers employing  and regeneration of the carrier frequency for that reason standard am continues to be widely used especially in broadcast transmission to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using  even analog television with a largely suppressed lower sideband includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection but for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed
the am modulation index is a measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the rf signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier it is thus defined as
mathh   \frac{\mathrm{peak\ value\ of\ } mt}{a}   \frac{m}{a}   math 
where mathm\ math and matha\ math are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude respectively the modulation amplitude is the peak positive or negative change in the rf amplitude from its unmodulated value modulation index is normally expressed as a percentage and may be displayed on a meter connected to an am transmitter
so if mathh 05 math carrier amplitude varies by 50% above and below its unmodulated level as is shown in the first waveform below for mathh 10 math it varies by 100% as shown in the illustration below it with 100% modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero and this represents full modulation using standard am and is often a target in order to obtain the highest possible  but mustnt be exceeded increasing the modulating signal beyond that point known as  causes a standard am modulator see below to fail as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero resulting in  clipping of the received modulation transmitters typically incorporate a  circuit to avoid overmodulation and or  a  circuit especially for voice communications in order to still approach 100% modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise such circuits are sometimes erred to as a 
however it is possible to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100% without introducing distortion in the case of  in that case negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase as shown in the third waveform below this cannot be produced using the efficient high level output stage modulation techniques see below which are widely used especially in high power  transmitters rather a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a  whats more a standard am receiver using an  is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal rather synchronous detection is required thus double sideband transmission is generally not erred to as am even though it generates an identical rf waveform as standard am as long as the modulation index is below 100% such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands where the useful information is present to the point of  where the carrier is ideally reduced to zero in all such cases the term modulation index loses its value as it ers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small or zero remaining carrier amplitude
modulation circuit designs may be classified as low  or high level depending on whether they modulate in a low power domain—followed by amplification for transmission—or in the high power domain of the transmitted signal
 
in modern radio systems modulated signals are generated via  dsp with dsp many types of am are possible with software control including dsb with carrier ssb suppressed carrier and independent sideband or isb calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a  typically at a frequency less than the desired rf output frequency the analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and  to the desired frequency and power level linear amplification must be used to prevent modulation distortion
 
this low level method for am is used in many amateur radio transceivers 
am may also be generated at a low level using analog methods described in the next section
high power am s such as those used for  are based on high efficiency  and class e  stages modulated by varying the supply voltage
 
older designs for broadcast and amateur radio also generate am by controlling the gain of the transmitter’s final amplifier generally class c for efficiency the following types are for vacuum tube transmitters but similar options are available with transistors
 
 plate modulation in plate modulation the plate voltage of the rf amplifier is modulated with the audio signal the audio power requirement is 50 percent of the rf carrier power
 heising constant current modulation rf amplifier plate voltage is fed through a  high value inductor the am modulation tube plate is fed through the same inductor so the modulator tube diverts current from the rf amplifier the choke acts as a constant current source in the audio range this system has a low power efficiency
 control grid modulation the operating bias and gain of the final rf amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid this method requires little audio power but care must be taken to reduce distortion
 clamp tube screen grid modulation the screen grid bias may be controlled through a “clamp tube” which reduces voltage according to the modulation signal it is difficult to approach 100 percent modulation while maintaining low distortion with this system
  one tube provides the power under carrier conditions and another operates only for positive modulation peaks overall efficiency is good and distortion is low
  two tubes are operated in parallel but partially out of phase with each other as they are differentially phase modulated  their combined amplitude is greater or smaller  efficiency is good and distortion low when properly adjusted
  a highly efficient high voltage power supply is applied to the tube plate the output voltage of this supply is varied at an audio rate to follow the program  this system was pioneered by  and has a number of variations all of which achieve high efficiency and sound quality
the simplest form of am demodulator consists of a diode which is configured to act as   another type of demodulator the  can provide better quality demodulation with additional circuit complexity

abbot meaning father is an al  given to the head of a  in various traditions including  the  may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery the female equivalent is 
the title had its origin in the  of  and  spread through the eastern  and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery the word is derived from the  av meaning father or abba meaning my father in the  it was written as abbas name eb  at first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk but it was soon restricted by  to certain priestly superiors at times it was applied to various priests eg at the court of the frankish monarchy the abbas palatinus of the palace and abbas castrensis of the camp were chaplains to the merovingian and carolingian sovereigns’ court and army respectively the title abbot came into fairly general use in western   whose members include priests
an abbot from  abbod abbad from  abbas “father” from  ἀββᾶς abbas from aramaic ܐܒܐ אבא ’abbā “father” confer german abt french abbé is the head and chief governor of a community of monks called also in the east  or  the english version for a female monastic head is  in  the highest ranking abbot who is only assigned to the most prominent temples or guan is known as a fangzhang all tao guan have low ranking abbots known as zhu chi name china daily english 
in  the first home of monasticism the jurisdiction of the abbot or archimandrite was but loosely defined sometimes he ruled over only one community sometimes over several each of which had its own abbot as well saint  speaks of an abbot of the  who had 500 monks under him by the  which until the  was the norm in the west the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community the rule as was inevitable was subject to frequent violations but it was not until the foundation of the  order that the idea of a supreme abbot exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order was definitely recognized
monks as a rule were laymen nor at the outset was the abbot any exception for the reception of the  and for other religious offices the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church this rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city and necessity compelled the  of some monks this innovation was not introduced without a struggle  dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher  life but before the close of the 5th century at least in the east abbots seem almost universally to have become s if not priests the change spread more slowly in the west where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century the ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils thus at the  ad 448 23 s or abbots sign with 30 s
the  ad 787 recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the  a power usually reserved to bishops
abbots were originally subject to  jurisdiction and continued generally so in fact in the west till the 11th century the  lib i tit iii de ep leg xl expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight the first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of faustus abbot of lerins at the council of arles ad 456 but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced far more than to the arrogance of abbots rendered it increasingly frequent and in the 6th century the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control and making them responsible to the pope alone received an impulse from  these exceptions introduced with a good object had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century virtually creating an imperium in imperio and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his 
in the 12th century the abbots of  claimed precedence of the  abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of st bernard and others adopted the episcopal insignia of  ring gloves and sandals
it has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine j braun liturgische gewandung pampnbsp453 the first undoubted instance is the bull by which  in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to egelsinus abbot of the monastery of st augustine at canterbury the mitred abbots in england were those of                        and http  facultyhistorywiscedu sommerville 361 361 03htm#ecclmap government in church and state from university of wisconsin madison retrieved 15 june 2013  of these the precedence was originally yielded to the abbot of glastonbury until in ad 1154  nicholas breakspear granted it to the abbot of st albans in which monastery he had been brought up next after the abbot of st albans ranked the abbot of westminster and then ramsey name ce  elsewhere the mitred abbots that sat in the  were of               and  pp 67 97  to distinguish abbots from bishops it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials and should not be ornamented with gold a rule which was soon entirely disregarded and that the crook of their  the crosier should turn inwards instead of outwards indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house
the adoption of certain episcopal insignia  by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the  ad 1123 in the east abbots if in priests orders and with the consent of the bishop were as we have seen permitted by the  ad 787 to confer the  and admit to the order of reader but gradually abbots in the west also advanced higher claims until we find them in ad 1489 permitted by  to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate  of course they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit
the power of the abbot was paternal but absolute limited however by the   one of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection it was sacred duty to execute the abbots orders and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression examples among the egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal are detailed by cassian and others eg a monk watering a dry stick day after day for months or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers   but paragraph lower down in eb1911  
 
when a vacancy occurred the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the  but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot in s exempt from the archbishops diocesan jurisdiction the confirmation and  had to be conferred by the pope in person the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbots journey to  it was necessary that an abbot should be at least 30 years of age of legitimate birth a monk of the house for at least 10 years name eb  unless it furnished no suitable candidate when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent well instructed himself and able to instruct others one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience in some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor cassian speaks of an abbot in egypt doing this and in later times we have another example in the case of st bruno popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks until in italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots and the king in france with the exception of cluny premontré and other houses chiefs of their order the election was for life unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order or when he was directly subject to them by the pope or the bishop and also in england it was for a term of 8–12 years name eb 
the ceremony of the formal admission of a  abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the  of abingdon  the newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church and proceed baoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession  after proceeding up the  he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his  and placed in his stall  the monks then kneeling gave him the kiss of peace on the hand and rising on the mouth the abbot holding his   he then put on his shoes in the  and a  was held and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon
before the late modern era the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house  when he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed  his letters were received kneeling as were those of the pope and the king  no monk might sit in his presence or leave it without his permission lecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society  the highest place was assigned to him both in church and at table  in the east he was commanded to eat with the other monks  in the west the  appointed him a separate table at which he might entertain guests and strangers  because this permission opened the door to luxurious living  decreed that the abbot should dine in the  and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks unless he had to entertain a guest these ordinances proved however generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots  when the abbot condescended to dine in the ectory his s waited upon him with the dishes a servant if necessary assisting them when abbots dined in their own private hall the rule of st benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table provided there was room on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels slanderous talk and idle gossiping
the ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks but by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk and adopting sumptuous attire  some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether and assumed a secular dress with the increase of wealth and power abbots had lost much of their special religious character and become great lords chiefly distinguished from lay lords by   thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt with their men carrying bows and arrows keeping horses dogs and huntsmen and special mention is made of an abbot of  c 1360 who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting  in magnificence of equipage and  the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm  they rode on mules with gilded bridles rich saddles and housings carrying hawks on their wrist followed by an immense train of attendants  the bells of the churches were rung as they passed  they associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction and shared all their pleasures and pursuits  this rank and power was however often used most beneficially  for instance we read of whiting the last abbot of  judicially murdered by  that his house was a kind of well ordered court where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen who had been sent to him for virtuous education had been brought up besides others of a lesser rank whom he fitted for the universities his table attendance and officers were an honour to the nation he would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week he had his country houses and fisheries and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons  the  and  were by virtue of their office s of the roman church
in the process of time the title abbot was extended to  who had no connection with the monastic system as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy and under the  to the chief chaplain of the king  or military chaplain of the emperor  it even came to be adopted by purely secular officials  thus the chief magistrate of the republic at  was called 
s m lat      or   or sometimes simply  were the outcome of the growth of the  system from the 8th century onwards  the practice of  by which—to meet a contemporary emergency—the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord in return for his protection
early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held in 
during the carolingian epoch the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable  or s and by the 10th century before the great  orm the system was firmly established even the  was held in commendam by  the example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent sometimes without any form of commendation whatever  in england the abuse was rife in the 8th century as may be gathered from the acts of the   these lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations ie the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions  the lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other  the  of abbeys differed in form and degree  sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions known usually as  decanus but also as abbot abbas legitimas monasticus regularis
when the great orm of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families as late as the 13th century and later the actual head of the community retaining that of dean  the connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys especially in the south of france lasted longer and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers abbates milltes for centuries together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues the abuse was not confined to the west  john  at the beginning of the 12th century informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen bencficiarii for life or for part of their lives by the emperors
 reported itinerary iiiv the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th century church of wales
for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards or rather patrons of their churches who in process of time from a desire of gain have usurped the whole right appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands leaving only to the clergy the altars with their tenths and oblations and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church such defenders or rather destroyers of the church have caused themselves to be called abbots and presumed to attribute to themselves a title as well as estates to which they have no just claim
in conventual cathedrals where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a 
in the roman catholic church abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term some orders of monks as the  for instance have no abbots only s a monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the pope and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows a certain number of years of establishment a certain firmness to the foundation in economic vocational and legal aspects prior to this the monastery would be a mere priory headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has
the abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks once chosen he must request blessing the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or with his permission another abbot or bishop the ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop with the new abbot being presented with the  the ring and the  as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority it does not confer further sacramental authority  it is not a further degree of holy orders although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy
once he has received this blessing the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense but their major superior under canon law and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector formerly he could confer the minor orders which are not sacraments that these ministries have replaced the abbey is a species of exempt religious in that it is for the most part answerable to the pope or to the abbot primate rather than to the local bishop
the abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross
s follow all of the above but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible
in some monastic families there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots in some cases this is the result of an abbey being considered the mother of several daughter abbeys founded originally as dependent priories of the mother in other cases abbeys have affiliated in networks known as congregations some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order
 the abbot of  di aventino in rome is styled the abbot primate and is acknowledged the senior abbot for the order of st benedict osb
 an abbot president is the head of a congregation federation of abbeys within the order of st benedict for instance the english congregation the american cassinese congregation etc or of the cistercians o cist
 an archabbot is the head of some monasteries which are the motherhouses of other monasteries for instance  
the title  french ital abate as commonly used in the catholic church on the european continent is the equivalent of the english father parallel etymology being loosely applied to all who have received the   this use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of france by the  between  and  1516 to appoint abbés commendataires to most of the abbeys in france  the expectation of obtaining these s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers and the class of abbés so formed—abbés de cour they were sometimes called and sometimes ironically abbés de sainte espérance abbés of holy hope or the pun of st hope—came to hold a recognized position  the connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind consisting mainly in adopting the title of abbé after a remarkably moderate course of theological study practising  and wearing a distinctive dress—a short dark violet coat with narrow collar  being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure many of the class found admission to the houses of the french nobility as tutors or advisers nearly every great family had its abbé the class did not survive the  but the  of abbé having long lost all connection in peoples minds with any special ecclesiastical function remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman
in the  and  the abbot is erred to as the  the superior of a convent of nuns is called the hēguménē the title of  literally the head of the enclosure used to mean something similar
in the east the principle set forth in the  still applies whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop those monasteries which enjoy the status of being stauropegiac will be subject only to a  or his  of bishops and not the local bishop
though the title abbot is not given in the western church to any but actual abbots of monasteries today the title archimandrite is given to monastics ie celibate priests in the east even when not attached to a monastery as an honor for service similar to the title of  in the western latin rite of the roman catholic church in the  only actual monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of  or  normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the orthodox church with the exception of married priests who have been ed since the time of  the ranks of abbot and archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the russian church and may be given to any monastic even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery in greek practice the title or function of abbot corresponds to a person who actually serves as the head of a monastery although the title of the archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery
in the  the german title of abt abbot is sometimes bestowed like the french abbé as an honorary distinction and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the reformation into collegiate foundations
of these the most noteworthy is  in  founded as a  house in 1163 by count wilbrand of hallermund and ormed in 1593 the abbot of loccum who still carries a pastoral staff takes precedence over all the clergy of hanover and was ex officio a member of the  of the kingdom  the governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot prior and the convent of en canons

additionally at the  of the  there is a threefold enthronement once in the throne the chancel as the  of  once in the  as the  and then once in the chapter house as titular abbot of canterbury

ardipithecus is a genus of an extinct  that lived during  and  in   originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the main ape lineage the relation of this  to human ancestors and whether it is a  is now a matter of debate name cbs  two fossil  are described in the literature a ramidus which lived about 44 million years ago name natgeo news  during the early  and a kadabba dated to approximately 56 million years ago late  name andthepaleobiology   behavioral analysis showed that ardipithecus could be very similar to those of  indicating that the early human ancestors were very chimpanzee like in behaviour 
a ramidus was named in september 1994 the first fossil found was dated to 44 million years ago on the basis of its stratigraphic position between two volcanic  the basal  gatc and the  dabt  the name ardipithecus ramidus stems mostly from the  in which ardi means ground floor borrowed from the semitic root in either amharic or arabic and ramid means root the pithecus portion of the name is from the  word for ape name nova 
like most hominids but unlike all previously recognized hominins it had a grasping  or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees it is not confirmed how much other features of its skeleton lect adaptation to  on the ground as well like later hominins ardipithecus had reduced 
in 1992–1993 a research team headed by  discovered the first a ramidus fossils—seventeen fragments including skull mandible teeth and arm bones—from the  in the  river valley of  more fragments were recovered in 1994 amounting to 45% of the total skeleton this fossil was originally described as a species of  but white and his colleagues later published a note in the same journal renaming the fossil under a new genus ardipithecus between 1999 and 2003 a multidisciplinary team led by  discovered bones and teeth of nine a ramidus individuals at  in the  western margin of ethiopias  name stoneageinstituteorg  the fossils were dated to between 435 and 445 million years old 
ardipithecus ramidus had a small brain measuring between 300 and 350ampnbspcmsup3 sup this is slightly smaller than a modern  or female  brain but much smaller than the brain of  like lucy ~400 to 550ampnbspcmsup3 sup and roughly 20% the size of the modern homo sapiens brain like common chimpanzees a ramidus was much more  than modern humans name suwa_2009 
the teeth of a ramidus lacked the specialization of other apes and suggest that it was a generalized  and  fruit eater with a diet that did not depend heavily on foliage fibrous plant material roots tubers etc or hard and or abrasive food the size of the upper  in a ramidus males was not distinctly different from that of females their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth the features of the upper canine in a ramidus contrast with the  observed in common chimpanzees where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females name suwa_2009b 
the less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in a ramidus has been used to infer aspects of the  of the species and more ancestral hominids in particular it has been used to suggest that the  of hominids and african apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups this is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition name suwa_2009b 
a ramidus existed more recently than the  of humans and chimpanzees  and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor nevertheless it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee after the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged both underwent substantial evolutionary change chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees a ramidus feet are better suited for walking the canine teeth of a ramidus are smaller and equal in size between males and females which suggests reduced male to male conflict increased pair bonding and increased parental investment thus fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools the research team concluded name andthepaleobiology  
on october 1  paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete a ramidus fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994 the fossil is the remains of a small brained 50 kilogram 110ampnbsplb female nicknamed ardi and includes most of the skull and teeth as well as the pelvis hands and feet name newkind   it was discovered in ethiopias harsh  at a site called  in the middle awash region radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that ardi lived about 44 million years ago this date however has been questioned by others fleagle and kappelman suggest that the region in which ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically and they argue that ardi should be dated at 39 million years name 101038 nature09709 
the fossil is regarded by its describers as shedding light on a stage of human evolution about which little was known more than a million years before  australopithecus afarensis the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived 32 million years ago and was discovered in 1974 just  away from ardis discovery site however because the ardi skeleton is no more than 200000 years older than the earliest fossils of australopithecus and may in fact be younger than they are name 101038 nature09709  some researchers doubt that it can represent a direct ancestor of australopithecus
some researchers infer from the form of her pelvis and limbs and the presence of her   that ardi was a  al when moving on the ground but al when moving about in tree branches name andthepaleobiology    a ramidus had a more primitive walking ability than later hominids and could not walk or run for long distances  the teeth suggest  and are more generalised than those of modern apes name andthepaleobiology

ardipithecus kadabba is known only from teeth and bits and pieces of skeletal bones name newkind  and is dated to approximately 56 million years ago name andthepaleobiology   it has been described as a probable  ie ancestor of a ramidus name andthepaleobiology   although originally considered a subspecies of a ramidus in 2004 anthropologists  gen suwa and  published an article elevating a kadabba to species level on the basis of newly discovered teeth from  these teeth show primitive morphology and wear pattern which demonstrate that a kadabba is a distinct species from a ramidus name mioceneteeth 
the specific name comes from the  word for basal family ancestor name ellisntb 
the toe and pelvic structure of a ramidus suggest to some researchers that the organism walked erect name stoneageinstituteorg  
according to  the gona projects  the fossil evidence from the  indicates that both a kadabba and a ramidus lived in a mosaic of woodland and grasslands with lakes swamps and springs nearby but further research is needed to determine which habitat ardipithecus at gona perred name stoneageinstituteorg  
due to several shared characters with chimpanzees its closeness to ape divergence period and due to its fossil incompletenes the exact position of ardipithecus in the fossil record is a subject of controversy  independent researcher such as esteban e sarmiento of the human evolution foundation in new jersey had systematically compared in 2010 the identifying characters of apes and human ancestral fossils in relation to ardipithecus and concluded that the comparison data is not sufficient to support an exclusive human lineage sarmiento noted that ardipithecus does not share any characters exclusive to humans and some of its characters those in the wrist and basicranium suggest it diverged from the common human african ape stock prior to the human chimpanzee and gorilla divergence   his comparative narrow  study in 2011 on the molar and body segment lengths which included living primates of similar body size noted that some dimensions including short upper limbs and  are reminiscent of humans but other dimensions such as long toes and relative molar surface area are great ape like sarmiento concluded that such length measures can change back and forth during evolution and are not very good indicators of relatedness the ardipithecus length measures however are good indicators of function and together with dental isotope data and the fauna and flora from the fossil site indicate ardipithecus was mainly a terrestrial quadruped collecting a large portion of its food on the ground its arboreal behaviors would have been limited and suspension from branches solely from the upper limbs rare 
however some later studies still argue for its classification in the human lineage comparative study in 2013 on carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil  revealed that ardipithecus fed both  on trees and on the ground in a more open habitat unlike chimpanzees and extinct ape  thereby differentiating them from apes  in 2014 it was reported that the hand bones of ardipithecus  and  consist of distinct human lineage feature which is the presence of third metacarpal  that is absent in apes  unique brain organisations such as lateral shift of the carotid foramina mediolateral abbreviation of the lateral  and a shortened trapezoidal  element in ardipithecus are also found only australopithecus and homo clade  comparison of the tooth root morphology with those of  also indicated strong resemblance  implying its correct inclusion in human lineage
in a study that assumes the hominin status of ardithecus ramidus it has been argued the species represents a  alteration of the more general great ape body planclark g henneberg m the life history of ardipithecus ramidus a heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation anthropological review volume 78 issue 2 june 2015 http  wwwdegruytercom view j anre201578issue 2 anre 2015 0009 anre 2015 0009xmlformat int  in this study the resemblance of the species craniofacial moprhology with that of subadult chimpanzees is attributed to dissociation of craniofacial growth from brain growth and associated life history trajectories such as eruption of the first molar and age of first birth consequently it is argued the species represents a unique ontogeny unlike any extant ape the reduced growth in the sub nasal alveolar region of the face which houses the projecting canine complex in chimpanzees suggests the species had rates of growth and reproductive biology unlike any living primate species in this sense the species may show the first trend towards human social parenting and sexual psychology consequently the authors argue it is no longer tenable to extrapolate from chimpanzees in reconstructions of early hominin social and mating behaviour providing further evidence against the so called chimpanzee erential modelsayers k et al human evolution and the chimpanzee erential model annual review of anthropology vol 41 119 138   as the authors write when discussing the species unusual pattern of cranio dental growth and the light it may throw on the origins of human sociality
the contrast of humans with chimpanzees is instructive for when humans start developing broader social bonds after the permanent dentition begins erupting at the same developmental milestone chimpanzee facial projection increases in other words humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio emotional development as a ramidus no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of a prognathic jaw with a c p3 complex which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species young and sub adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group the implication of these interspecific differences is that a ramidus would have most likely had a period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees consequently it is possible that in aramidus we see the first albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisationclark g henneberg m pp126 7 
it should be noted that this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of aramidus the study also provides support for stephen jay goulds theory in  that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories

an assembly line is a  process most of the time called a progressive assembly in which parts usually  are added as the semi finished assembly moves from workstation to work station where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced by mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi finished assembly from work station to work station a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly
assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as s and other  equipment  appliances and 
assembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of s s or machines and parts  the motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible all parts or assemblies are handled either by s or motorized vehicles such as  or  with no manual trucking heavy lifting is done by machines such as s or fork lifts each worker typically performs one simple operation
according to 
consider the assembly of a  assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine install the hood and install the wheels in that order with arbitrary interstitial steps only one of these steps can be done at a time in traditional production only one car would be assembled at a time if  installation takes 20 minutes  installation takes five minutes and s installation takes 10 minutes then a car can be produced every 35 minutes
in an assembly line car assembly is split between several stations all working simultaneously when one station is finished with a car it passes it on to the next by having three stations a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time each one at a different stage of its assembly
after finishing its work on the first car the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car while the engine installation crew works on the second car the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels after the engine has been installed on the second car the second car moves to the hood assembly at the same time the third car moves to the engine assembly when the third car’s engine has been mounted it then can be moved to the hood station meanwhile subsequent cars if any can be moved to the engine installation station
assuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another the longest stage on the assembly line determines the  20 minutes for the engine installation so a car can be produced every 20 minutes once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced
before the  most manufactured products were made individually by hand a single  or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product they would use their skills and tools such as  and  to create the individual parts they would then assemble them into the final product making cut and try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together 
 was practiced in china where state run monopolies  metal agricultural implements china and armor and weapons centuries before it appeared in europe on the eve of the industrial revolution    discussed the  in the manufacture of  at length in his book  published in 1776
the  dating to about 1104 operated similar to a production line  ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed  at the peak of its  in the early 16th century the  employed some 16000 people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day and could fit out arm and provision a newly built  with standardized parts on an assembly line basis  although the venice arsenal lasted until the early  production line methods did not become common even then
the  led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention many industries notably s s  name   xovodv 1985  s s s and s saw expeditious improvement in materials handling machining and assembly during the 19th century although modern concepts such as  and  had not yet been named
the automatic   built by  in 1785 was called the beginning of modern  by roe 1916 evanss mill used a leather belt bucket elevator s canvas belt conveyors and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour  the innovation spread to other mills and breweries  
probably the earliest industrial example of a linear and continuous assembly process is the  built between 1801 and 1803  father of  with the help of  and others designed 22 types of machine tools to make the parts for the rigging  used by the  this factory was so successful that it remained in use until the 1960s with the workshop still visible at  in  and still containing some of the original machinery
one of the earliest examples of an almost modern factory layout designed for easy material handling was the   the factory grounds were bordered by the  and the  the buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings s were used for lifting the heavy work which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons  the work passed sequentially through to erection of framework and final assembly 
the first flow assembly line was initiated at the factory of  leiston works in  in the  of  for the manufacture of s the assembly line area was called  on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853 the  was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added from the upper level where other parts were made the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level when the machine reached the end of the shop it would be completed
 
during the early 19th century the development of s such as the   and  and of toolpath control via  and  provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making  a practical reality
steam powered s began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the 19th century name wells1890  hounshell 1984 shows a  sketch of an electric powered conveyor moving cans through a filling line in a canning factory
the  industry of  is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines or dis assembly lines to be utilized in the united states starting in 1867 workers would stand at fixed stations and a pulley system would bring the meat to each worker and they would complete one task henry ford and others have written about the influence of this  practice on the later developments at ford motor company
according to a book entitled michigan yesterday amp today authored by robert w domm the modern assembly line and its basic concept is credited to  who used it to build the first mass produced automobile the  name michigan yesterday  olds  the assembly line concept which he put to work in his  factory in 1901  this development is often overshadowed by  who perfected the assembly line by installing driven  that could produce a  in 93 minutes name michigan yesterday 
the assembly line developed for the  began operation on december 1 1913  it had immense influence on the world
the basic kernel of an assembly line concept was introduced to  by william pa klann upon his return from visiting  in chicago and viewing what was erred to as the disassembly line where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor the efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over caught his attention he reported the idea to  soon to be head of ford production who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed others at ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to  but pa klanns slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the henry ford museum  and elsewhere making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept the process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of  the factory superintendent  martins assistant  draftsman and toolmaker   and  some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of  placement that  had been doing at ford up to 1908
in 1922 ford through his ghostwriter crowther said of his 1913 assembly line
 in his 1956 memoir my forty years with ford presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual “inventors” as a gradual logical development of 
as a result of these developments in method fords cars came off the line in three minute intervals this was much faster than previous methods increasing production by eight to one requiring 125 man hours before 1 hour 33 minutes after while using less manpower name   xovodv  it was so successful  became a bottleneck only  would dry fast enough forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914 until fast drying   was developed in 1926 name   xovodv 
the assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into american society  decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the model t to fall within the budget of the american middle class  in 1908 the price of a model t was around 825 and by 1912 it had decreased to around 575  this price reduction is comparable to a reduction from 15000 to 10000 in dollar terms from the year 2000 in 1914 an assembly line worker could buy a model t with four months pay name   xovodv 
fords complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of  the combination of high wages and high efficiency is called  and was copied by most major industries the efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take off of the united states the assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods
ford at one point considered suing other car companies because they used the assembly line in their production but decided against it realizing it was essential to creation and expansion of the industry as a whole 
in the  its success was dominating and quickly spread worldwide ford france and ford britain in 1911 ford denmark 1923 ford germany 1925 in 1919 vulcan southport lancashire was the first native european manufacturer to adopt it soon companies had to have assembly lines or risk going broke by not being able to compete by 1930 250 companies which did not had disappeared name   xovodv 
the massive demand for military hardware in world war ii prompted assembly line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production thousands of s were built making extensive use of pabrication enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days after having produced fewer than 3000 planes for the united states military in 1939 american aircraft manufacturers built over 300000 planes in world war ii  pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing other companies quickly followed as william s knudsen of the national defense advisory commission observed we won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production the like of which he had never seen nor dreamed possible  
in his 1922 autobiography name ford1922  henry ford mentions several benefits of the assembly line including
workers do no heavy lifting
no stooping or bending over
no special training required
there are jobs that almost anyone can do
provided employment to immigrants
the gains in  allowed ford to increase worker pay from 150 per day to 500 per day once employees reached three years of service on the assembly line ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the model t price  these goals appear altruistic however it has been argued that they were implemented by ford in order to reduce high employee turnover when the assembly line was introduced in 1913 it was discovered that “every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel it was necessary to hire 963” in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired 
 work has explored the  and  that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long  
one of capitalisms most famous critics  highlighted in the entfremdung theory the fact that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects theyve created products should be mirrors in which workers see their lected essential nature marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalise facets of our personality specialisation makes it incredibly difficult for any worker to achieve a sense of genuine contribution they may be making to the real needs of humanity the repetitive nature of specialised tasks causes a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day and who they really are and would ideally be able to contribute to existence marx also argued that specialised jobs are insecure since they make the worker utterly expendable the minute costs rise and savings can be made through technology  marx karl comment on james mill economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 1844 
since workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day  are a possible pathology of   also proved dangerous when it was not too high workers were often prohibited from talking  a  at the  recalled that beside being prohibited from speaking the semi skilled workers had only 25 centimeters in which to move  industrial  later tried to minimize physical trauma

alan garner  born 17 october 1934 is an english novelist best known for his  novels and his retellings of traditional british folk tales his work is firmly rooted in the landscape history and folklore of his native county of   being set in the region and making use of the native 
born in  garner grew up around the nearby town of  and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as the edge where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region studying at manchester grammar school and then briefly at  in 1957 he moved to the nearby village of blackden where he bought and renovated an early modern building known as toad hall his first novel  was published in 1960 a childrens fantasy novel set on the edge it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters garner completed a sequel  1963 but left the third book of the trilogy he had envisioned instead he produced a string of further fantasy novels  1965  1967 and  1973
turning away from fantasy as a genre garner produced  1979 a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family he also published a series of british folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled alan garners fairy tales of gold 1979 alan garners book of british fairy tales 1984 and a bag of moonshine 1986 in his subsequent novels  1996 and  2003 he continued writing tales revolving around cheshire although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work in 2012 he finally published a third book in the weirdstone trilogy 
garner was born in the front room of his grandmothers house in  cheshire on 17 october 1934 he grew up nearby in  a well to do village that had effectively become a suburb of  his rural working class family had been connected to alderley edge since at least the sixteenth century and could be traced back to the death of william garner in 1592 garner claims that his family had passed on a genuine oral tradition involving folk tales about the edge which included a description of a king and his army of knights who slept under it guarded by a wizard in the mid nineteenth century alans great great grandfather robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the face of a cliff next to a well known locally at that time as the wizards well
robert garner and his other relatives had all been craftsmen and according to garner each successive generation had tried to improve on or do something different from the previous generation garners grandfather joseph garner could read but didnt and so was virtually unlettered instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about the edge garner later remarked that as a result he was aware of the edges magic as a child and he and his friends often played there the story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life becoming he explained deeply embedded in my psyche and heavily influencing his later novels
garner faced several life threatening childhood illnesses which left him bed ridden for much of the time he went to a local village school where he found that despite being praised for his intelligence he was punished for speaking in his native  for instance when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water garner then won a place at  where he received his secondary education entry was means tested resulting in his school fees being waived rather than focusing his interest on creative writing it was here that he excelled at  he was then conscripted into  serving for a time with the  while posted to  in 
at school he garner had developed a keen interest in the work of  and  as well as the  thus he decided to pursue the study of  at  passing his entrance exams in january 1953 at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic he was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education and he noted that this removed him from his cultural background and led to something of a schism with other members of his family who could not cope with me and i could not cope with them looking back he remarked i soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over regular verbs in 1955 he joined the university theatrical society playing the role of  in a performance of s  where he co starred alongside  and where  was the stage manager in august 1956 he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree he left oxford in late 1956 he nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained a permanent strength through all my life
aged 22 garner was out cycling when he came across a hand painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in toad hall  a late medieval building situated in blackden seven miles from alderley edge  was on sale for £510 although he personally could not afford it he was lent the money by the local  lodge enabling him to purchase and move in to the cottage in june 1957 in the late nineteenth century the hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers cottages but garner was able to purchase the second for £150 about a year later he proceeded to knock down the dividing walls and convert both halves back into a single home
garner had begun writing his first novel  in september 1956 however it was while at toad hall that he finished the book set in alderley edge it revolved around two children susan and colin who are sent to live in the area with their mothers old nurse maid bess and her husband gowther mossock setting about to explore the edge they discover a race of malevolent creatures the svart alfar who dwell in the edges abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them until they are rescued by the wizard cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are amassing at the edge in search of the titular weirdstone of brisingamen whilst engaged in writing in his spare time garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher but soon gave that up believing that i couldnt write and teach the energies were too similar and so began working as a general labourer for four years remaining unemployed for much of that time
garner sent his debut novel to the publishing company  where it was picked up by the companys head sir william collins who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of s  1954–55 garner who went on to become a personal friend of collins would later relate that billy collins saw a title with funny looking words in it on the stockpile and he decided to publish it on its release in 1960 the weirdstone of brisingamen proved to be a critical and commercial success later being described as a tour de force of the imagination a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children garner himself however would later denounce this novel as a fairly bad book in 1968
with his first book published garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter living a hand to mouth lifestyle on a shoestring budget he also worked on a sequel to the weirdstone of brisingamen which would be known as  the moon of gomrath also revolves around the adventures of colin and susan with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the  who has recently entered the world with the help of the wizard cadellin the brollachan is exorcised but susans soul also leaves her body being sent to another dimension leading colin to find a way to bring it back critic neil philip characterised it as an artistic advance but a less satisfying story in a 1989 interview garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of colin and susan envisioning a trilogy but that he had intentionally decided not to write it instead moving on to write something different however boneland the conclusion to the sequence was belatedly published in august 2012http  wwwguardiancouk books 2012 mar 15 alan garner weirdstone brisingamen trilogy boneland alan garner to conclude weirdstone of brisingamen trilogy alison flood guardiancouk 15 march 2012 retrieved 15 march 2012 
in 1962 garner began work on a  named elidor which would result in the completion of a novel of the same name set in contemporary manchester elidor tells the story of four children who enter into a derelict victorian church in which they find a portal to the magical realm of elidor here they are entrusted by king malebron to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting to take control of the kingdom successfully doing so the children return to manchester with the treasures but are pursued by the malevolent forces who need them to seal their victory
before writing elidor garner had seen a dinner service set which could be arranged to make pictures of either flowers or owls inspired by this design he produced his fourth novel  the story was also heavily influenced by the medieval welsh tale of  from the  the owl service was critically acclaimed winning both the  and  it also sparked discussions among critics as to whether garner should properly be considered a childrens writer given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership
it took garner six years to write his next novel  in this he provided three intertwined love stories one set in the present another during the  and the third in the second century ce philip erred to it as a complex book but not a complicated one the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear
academic specialist in childrens literature maria nikolajeva characterised red shift as a difficult book for an unprepared reader identifying its main themes as those of loneliness and failure to communicate ultimately she thought that repeated re readings of the novel bring about the realisation that it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so called realistic juvenile novels
from 1976 to 1978 garner published a series of four novellas which have come to be collectively known as  quartet the stone book granny reardun the aimer gate and tom fobbles day each focused on a day in the life of a child in the garner family each from a different generation
in a 1989 interview garner noted that although writing the stone book quartet had been exhausting it had been the most rewarding of everything hed done to date philip described the quartet as a complete command of the material he had been working and reworking since the start of his career
garner pays particular attention to language and strives to render the cadence of the cheshire tongue in modern english this he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading  the footnotes would not have been needed by his father
in 1981 the literary critic neil philip published an analysis of garners novels as a fine anger which was based on his doctoral thesis produced for the  in 1980 in this study he noted that the stone book quartet marks a watershed in garners writing career and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far
in 1996 garners novel  was published his collection of essays and public talks the voice that thunders contains much autobiographical material including an account of his life with  as well as critical lection upon folklore and language literature and education the nature of myth and time in the voice that thunders he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade long drought at the height of the  tide which preceded strandloper to forsake literature and become instead a popular writer cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to and making series of the earlier booksalan garner the voice that thunders london 1997 p 35  garner feared that making series  would render sterile the existing work the life that produced it and bring about my artistic and spiritual deathgarner thunders p 36  and felt unable to comply
garners novel  was published in 2003 garners novel boneland was published in 2012 nominally completing a trilogy begun some 50 years earlier with 
with his first wife anne cook he had three children in 1972 he married for a second time this time to griselda greaves a teacher and critic with whom he had two children in a 2014 interview conducted with  for british archaeology magazine garner stated that i dont have anything to do with the literary world i avoid writers i dont like them most of my close personal friends are professional archaeologists
although garners early work is often labelled as childrens literature garner himself rejects such a description informing one interviewer that i certainly have never written for children but that instead he has always written purely for himself neil philip in his critical study of garners work 1981 commented that up till that point everything alan garner has published has been published for children although he went on to relate that it may be that garners is a case where the division between childrens and adults literature is meaningless and that his fiction is instead enjoyed by a type of person no matter what their age
philip offered the opinion that the essence of his work was the struggle to render the complex in simple bare terms to couch the abstract in the concrete and communicate it directly to the reader he added that garners work is intensely autobiographical in both obvious and subtle ways highlighting garners use of mythological and folkloric sources philip stated that his work explores the disjointed and troubled psychological and emotional landscape of the twentieth century through the symbolism of myth and folklore he also expressed the opinion that time is gardners most consistent theme
the english author and academic  noted that garner was attentive to the geological archaeological and cultural history of his settings and caul to integrate his fiction with the physical reality beyond the page as a part of this garner had included maps of alderley edge in both the weirdstone of brisingamen and the moon of gomrath garner has spent much time investigating the areas that he deals with in his books writing in the  in 1968 garner commented that in preparation for writing his book elidor
i had to read extensively textbooks on physics celtic symbolism unicorns medieval watermarks megalithic archaeology study the writings of  brush up my  visit   and  spend a lot of time with demolition gangs on slum clearance sites and listen to the whole of s  nearly every day
in a paper published in the  maria nikolajeva characterised garner as one of the most controversial authors of modern childrens literature
in the fiftieth anniversary edition of the weirdstone of brisingamen published by  in 2010 several notable british fantasy novelists praised garner and his work  related that the power and range of alan garners astounding talent has grown with every book hes written whilst  called him one of britains greatest writers whose works really matter  the author of the  trilogy went further when he remarked that
garner is indisputably the great originator the most important british writer of fantasy since  and in many respects better than tolkien because deeper and more truthful any country except britain would have long ago recognised his importance and celebrated it with postage stamps and statues and street names but thats the way with us our greatest prophets go unnoticed by the politicians and the owners of media empires i salute him with the most heartfelt respect and admiration
another british fantasy writer  claimed that garners fiction is something special in that it was smart and challenging based in the here and the now in which real english places emerged from the shadows of folklore and in which people found themselves walking living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth praise also came from nick lake the editorial director of  childrens books who proclaimed that garner is quite simply one of the greatest and most influential writers this country has ever produced

an algebraic number is any  that is a  of a non zero  in one variable with  coefficients or equivalently – by clearing s – with  coefficients all s and s are algebraic the same is not true for  and s because of s such as   real and complex numbers are transcendentalsee  
the s expressed as the quotient of two s a and b b not equal to zero satisfy the above definition because mathx a b math is the root of mathbx a mathsome of the following examples come from hardy and wright 1972159–160 and pp 178–179 
the s irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial mathax^2 + bx + c math with integer coefficients matha math mathb math and mathc math are algebraic numbers if the quadratic polynomial is monic matha   1 math then the roots are s
the s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass these include all quadratic surds all rational numbers and all numbers that can be formed from these using the  and the extraction of square roots note that by designating cardinal directions for 1 −1 mathi math and math i math complex numbers such as math3+\sqrt{2}i math are considered constructible
any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of  gives another algebraic number
polynomial roots that cannot be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of nth roots such as the roots of mathx^5   x + 1  math this  but not all polynomials of degree 5 or higher
s those complex numbers matha+bi math where both matha math and mathb math are integers are also quadratic integers
 of  multiples of math\pi math except when undefined that is the s for example each of math\cos\pi 7 math math\cos3\pi 7 math math\cos5\pi 7 math satisfies math8x^3   4x^2   4x + 1   0 math this polynomial is  over the rationals and so these three cosines are conjugate algebraic numbers likewise math\tan3\pi 16 math math\tan7\pi 16 math math\tan11\pi 16 math math\tan15\pi 16 math all satisfy the irreducible polynomial mathx^4   4x^3   6x^2 + 4x + 1 math and so are conjugate 
some s are algebraic and some are not
the numbers math\sqrt{2} math and math\sqrt3{3} 2 math are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials mathx^2   2 math and math8x^3   3 math respectively
the  math\phi math is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial mathx^2   x   1 math
the numbers  and  are not algebraic numbers see the also  can be used to produce as many examples of transcendentals numbers as we please cf hardy and wright p 161ff  hence they are transcendental

the set of algebraic numbers is  enumerablehardy and wright 1972160   2008205 niven 1956 theorem 75 
hence the set of algebraic numbers has  zero as a subset of the complex numbers ie  complex numbers are not algebraic
given an algebraic number there is a unique  with rational coefficients of least  that has the number as a root this polynomial is called its  if its minimal polynomial has degree mathn math then the algebraic number is said to be of degree mathn math an algebraic number of degree 1 is a  a real algebraic number of degree 2 is a 
all algebraic numbers are  and theore  and 
the set of real algebraic numbers is  countable  and without first or last element so is  to the set of rational numbers
for real numbers a and b the complex number a + bi is algebraic if and only if both a and b are algebraicniven 1956 corollary 73 
the sum and product of two algebraic numbers are   and always give an algebraic number  the algebraic numbers theore form a  span style text decoration overlineq span sometimes denoted by a though this usually denotes the  every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are algebraic numbers is again algebraic this can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is  in fact it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals and is theore called the  of the rationals
the set of real algebraic numbers itself forms a fieldniven 1956 p 92 
all numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a  number of integer s s s s and taking nth roots where n is a positive integer ie s are algebraic the converse however is not true there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner all of these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree ≥5 this is a result of  see s and the  an example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial  which is approximately 1167304
algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials starting from the rational numbers one may generalize this to s which may be defined in various ways most broadly all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials exponentials and logarithms are called elementary numbers and these include the algebraic numbers plus some transcendental numbers most narrowly one may consider numbers explicitly defined in terms of polynomials exponentials and logarithms – this does not include all algebraic numbers but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as e or log2
an  is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 a monic polynomial examples of algebraic integers are   and  note theore that the algebraic integers constitute a proper  of the s as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials  for all  in this sense algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what s are to s
the sum difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers which means that the algebraic integers form a  the name algebraic integer comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers and because the algebraic integers in any  are in many ways analogous to the integers if k is a number field its  is the subring of algebraic integers in k and is frequently denoted as osubk sub these are the prototypical examples of s

in  an automorphism is an  from a  to itself it is in some sense a  of the object and a way of  the object to itself while preserving all of its structure the set of all automorphisms of an object forms a  called the automorphism group it is loosely speaking the  of the object
the exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of mathematical object in question and what precisely constitutes an isomorphism of that object the most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called  category theory deals with abstract objects and s between those objects
in category theory an automorphism is an  ie a  from an object to itself which is also an  in the categorical sense of the word
this is a very abstract definition since in category theory morphisms arent necessarily functions and objects arent necessarily sets in most concrete settings however the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure
in the context of  for example a mathematical object is an  such as a   or  an isomorphism is simply a   the definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure see for example   and 
the   is called the trivial automorphism in some contexts respectively other non identity automorphisms are called nontrivial automorphisms
if the automorphisms of an object x form a set instead of a proper  then they form a  under  of s this group is called the automorphism group of x that this is indeed a group is simple to see
  composition of two endomorphisms is another endomorphism
  composition of morphisms is always associative
  the identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself which exists by definition
  by definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism
the automorphism group of an object x in a category c is denoted autsubc subx or simply autx if the category is clear from context
 in  an arbitrary  of the elements of a set x is an automorphism the automorphism group of x is also called the  on x
 in  the set of s z considered as a group under addition has a unique nontrivial automorphism negation considered as a  however it has only the trivial automorphism generally speaking negation is an automorphism of any  but not of a ring or field
 a group automorphism is a  from a group to itself informally it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged for every group g there is a natural group homomorphism g → autg whose  is the group inng of s and whose  is the  of g thus if g has  center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group name pahl
 
 in  an endomorphism of a  v is a  v → v an automorphism is an invertible linear operator on v when the vector space is finite dimensional the automorphism group of v is the same as the  glv
 an example of an automorphism is a  which leaves the geometrical form of a figure unchangedklaus maintzer local activity principle the cause of complexity and symmetry breaking chapter 12 pages 146–159 in  
 a field automorphism is a   from a  to itself in the cases of the s q and the s r there are no nontrivial field automorphisms some subfields of r have nontrivial field automorphisms which however do not extend to all of r because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in r in the case of the s c there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends r into r  but there are infinitely  many wild automorphisms assuming the    field automorphisms are important to the theory of s in particular s in the case of a galois extension l k the  of all automorphisms of l fixing k pointwise is called the  of the extension
the field  qsubp sub of p adic numbers has no nontrivial automorphisms
 in  an  is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non edges in particular if two nodes are joined by an edge so are their images under the permutation
 for relations see 
 in  see 
 in  an automorphism may be called a  of the space specialized terminology is also used
 in  an automorphism is a self  the automorphism group is also called the 
 in the category of s an automorphism is a bijective  map also called a  from a surface to itself for example the automorphisms of the  are s
 an automorphism of a differentiable  m is a  from m to itself the automorphism group is sometimes denoted diffm
 in  morphisms between topological spaces are called  and an automorphism of a topological space is a  of the space to itself or self homeomorphism see  in this example it is not sufficient for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism
one of the earliest group automorphisms automorphism of a group not simply a group of automorphisms of points was given by the irish mathematician  in 1856 in his  where he discovered an order two automorphism  writing
blockquoteso that math\mu math is a new fifth root of unity connected with the former fifth root math\lambda math by relations of perfect reciprocity blockquote
in some categories—notably   and s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types called inner and outer automorphisms
in the case of groups the s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself for each element a of a group g conjugation by a is the operation  given by  or asup−1 supga usage varies one can easily check that conjugation by a is a group automorphism the inner automorphisms form a  of autg denoted by inng this is called 
the other automorphisms are called s the   is usually denoted by outg the non trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms
the same definition holds in any   or  where a is any  for s the definition is slightly different

the instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or  causing s called pallets to open which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel called  that vibrate to produce sound inside the body group notesfor the accordions place among the families of musical instruments see henry doktorskis http  wwwksantinet free reed description taxonomyhtml taxonomy of musical instruments the classical free reed inc also on this page is diarmuid pigotts the free reed family of aerophones   the performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right hand  and the  consisting of bass and pre set chord buttons on the left hand manual  
the accordion is widely spread across the world in some countries for example     and  it is used in popular music for example   and b pop in  whereas in other regions such as   and other countries in  it tends to be more used for  and  and as well as in regional and  is often used in  in   and  nevertheless in europe and north america  also make use of the instrument additionally the accordion is also used in    and in both solo and orchestra performances of

accordions have many configurations and types what may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another
 some accordions are bisonoric producing different  depending on the direction of bellows movement
 others are unisonoric and produce the same pitch in both directions the pitch also depends on its size
 some use a  buttonboard for the right hand manual
 others use a  buttonboard for the right hand manual
 yet others use a  style  for the right hand manual
 some can play in different 
 craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently personalizing the end result such as an  technician might  a particular instrument
 
the  is the most recognizable part of the instrument and the primary means of  similar to a s bow the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player the bellows is located between the right  and left hand manuals and is made from ed layers of cloth and cardboard with added leather and metalhttp  1accordionnet bellowshtm how to repair bellows ikes accordion  it is used to create pressure and vacuum driving air across the internal  and producing sound by their vibration applied pressure increasing the volume
the keyboard touch is not  and does not affect  all expression is effected through the bellows some bellows effects as illustrated below
# bellows used for volume control fade
# repeated change of direction bellows shake which has been popularized by http  wwwalmanaquebrasilcombr personalidades musica 6505 luiz gonzagahtml  and is extensively used in  and called resfulengo in brazil
# constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals
# constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance
# using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions particularly for this instrument
 
the accordions body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows these boxes house reed chambers for the right  and left hand manuals respectively each side has s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument and to allow the  to better project the grille for the right hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes the right hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left hand manual for playing the accompaniment however skilled players can reverse these roles group notes claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand sharpshooters march 1908 guido deiro guido deiros own story of sharpshooters march the pietro musicordion volume 6 number 2 may–june 1948 
the size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type layout and playing range which can be as small as  to have only one or two rows of basses and a single  on the right hand manual to the standard 120 bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160 bass free bass converter models
 
the accordion is an  the manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow or disables it group notesillustration made with erence from a similar illustration that can be found in both det levende bælgspil p 9 by jeanette amp lars dyremose 2003 and harmonikaens historie p 35a by bjarne glenstrup 1972 the university of copenhagen faculty of music 
there is a wide range of instruments that are called accordion the different types have varying components all instruments have reed ranks of some format not all have switches the most typical accordion is the piano accordion which is used for many musical genres another type of accordion is the button accordion which is used in several musical traditions including cajun conjunto and  swiss and austro german alpine music argentinian tango music and many other folk genres
 
different systems exist for the right hand manual of an accordion which is normally used for playing the melody some use a  layout arranged in one way or another while others use a  style keyboard each system has different claimed benefits name pianovschromatic  by those who per it they are also used to define one accordion or another as a different type
 s and the  a n variant use a buttonboard where notes are arranged ally two major systems exist erred to as the b system and the c system there are also regional variants
 s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of  in a small number of keys the keys are often arranged in one row for each key available  chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows the adjective diatonic is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions—that is instruments whose right hand manual and in some instances even bass keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows for instance producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7 9 while opening such is the case for instance with the argentinian  the austro german  the italian  the swiss  and the     
 s use a  similar to a  at right angles to the cabinet the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows
  accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a uniform or whole tone arrangement the chromatic scale consists of two rows the third row is a repetition of the first row so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales these accordions are produced only in special editions e g the logicordion produced by 
 
different systems are also in use for the left hand manual which is normally used for playing the accompaniment these almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing there are three general categories
 the  also called standard bass is arranged in a  and uses single buttons for 
 the  is a variation used in  chromatic accordions it is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order this system has 3 rows of basses 3 rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies combined chords better use of fingers 1 and 5 and more space between the buttons this system was poorly traded outside of native belgium
 various s for greater access to playing melodies on the left hand manual and to forming ones own chords these are often chosen for playing  and  some models can convert between free bass and stradella bass this is called converter bass
 
inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones these are organized in different sounding banks which can be further combined into registers producing differing s all but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate organized from high to low  each register stop produces a separate sound timbre see the  article for further explanation and audio samples
all but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches the larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches
 
in describing pricing an accordion the first factor is size expressed in number of keys on either side for a piano type this could for one example be 37 96 meaning 37 keys 3 octaves plus one note on the treble side and 96 bass keys after size the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side either on a  or not and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches typically these could be announced as reeds 5 + 3 meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass and registers 13 + m 7 meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special master that activates all ranks like the tutti on an organ and seven register switches on the bass side
 
the larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller es and are equipped with two shoulder  to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting and avoid dropping the instrument while standing
other accordions such as the  have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap all accordions have a mostly adjustable leather strap on the left hand manual to keep the players hand in position while drawing the bellows there are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing
various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions  many remain curiosities — only a few have remained in use
the  used in   and  which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion

the  of the  has a two row diatonic bisonoric treble and a 12 button diatonic unisonoric bass
in scotland the favoured diatonic accordion is the instrument known as the  while the right hand is bisonoric the left hand follows the stradella system the elite form of this instrument is generally considered the german manufactured shand morino produced by  with the input of p98 howard rob 2003 an a to z of the accordion and related instruments stockport robaccord publications isbn 978 0 9546711 0 5

the accordion is a free reed instrument and is in the same family as other instruments such as the  and  the sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today

the accordion is one of several european inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows an instrument called accordion was first patented in 1829 by  of armenian origin in  group notesa summary and pictures of this patent can be found at http  replaywaybackmachineorg 20090619162610 http  wwwksantinet free reed history demianhtml wwwksantinet free reed history demianhtml version of 20 okt 4   19 jun 09 using way back machine to display

demians instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments it only had a left hand buttonboard with the right hand simply operating the bellows one key feature for which demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key his instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key one for each bellows direction a bisonoric action
the piano accordion was first played in german speaking regions and then spread over europe some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821 but it started to actually be played much later and built its reputation from there
at that time in vienna mouth harmonicas with kanzellen chambers had already been available for many years along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows the  key arrangement was also already in use on mouth blown instruments demians patent thus covered an accompanying instrument an accordion played with the left hand opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing the patent also described instruments with both  and  sections although demian perred the bass only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages group notesgerman text mit den dekel des balges läßt sich das ganze instrument verdoppeln so daß man dadurch die accorde vermehrt oder auch mit einzelne töne spielen kann in diesem fall muß ein zweyter einsatz mit federn und auch eine 2te claviatur dazu kommen der blasebalg bleibt in der mitte jede hand dirigirt abwechselnd entweder die claves oder den balg durch eine obengenannte verdoplung des instruments oder durch vermehrung der accorde würde niemand etwas verbessern oder was neues liefern weil nur die bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt das instrument theurer und schwerer wird
translation of this snip with the cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated so the amount of chords or single notes can be enlarged or one can sound single notes in this case a second part with springs free reeds and also a second keyboard must be added the bellows are in between these two parts both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the instrument is heavier and more expensivehttp  wwwakkordeon onlinede instrum demianhtm german full text

after demians invention other accordions appeared some featuring only the righthanded keyboard for playing melodies it took english inventor charles wheatstone to squeeze both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox his 1844 patent for what he called a “concertina” also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool
the musician adolph müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book schule für accordion at the time  and  had a close musical relationship with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year so it is possible that wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key arrangement ideas into practice
jeunes  resembles wheatstones  in internal construction and  but it appears to complement demians accordion functionally the flutina is a one sided bisonoric melody only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left when the two instruments are combined the result is quite similar to  button accordions still manufactured today
further innovations followed and continue to the present various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed as well as voicings the combination of multiple tones at different octaves with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance and different methods of internal construction to improve tone stability and durability

notably the finnish symphonic folk metal band  has always had a full time accordionist employing  and  style sensibilities alongside a violinist another finnish metal band  invokes a type of finnish polka called  and also has a full time accordionist sarah kiener the former  player for the swiss melodic death folk metal band  played a  accordion known as a zugerörgeli which could be a distant relative in one way or another to the swiss  as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of switzerland
the best accordions are always fully hand made especially in the aspect of reeds completely hand made reeds have a far better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured reeds some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low end instruments such as the ones improved by yutaka usuihttp  wwwirishdancemastercom  yutaka usuai japanese born accordion craftsman  a japanese born craftsman
the manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process in a sense all accordions are handmade since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required the general process involves making the individual parts assembling the subsections assembling the entire instrument and final decorating and packaginghttp  replaywaybackmachineorg 20081226093126 http  enotescom how products encyclopedia accordion how products encyclopedia_accordion old way back link to how products encyclopedia accordion

the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub problems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention name problems of ai 
 
   this is linked to in the introduction   
   solved problems   
early ai researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions name reasoning  by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with  or incomplete information employing concepts from  and economics name uncertain reasoning 
   two important unsolved problems   
for difficult problems most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources – most experience a  the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size the search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for ai research name intractability 
human beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgements rather than the conscious step by step deduction that early ai research was able to model name psychological evidence of sub symbolic reasoning  ai has made some progress at imitating this kind of sub symbolic problem solving  approaches emphasize the importance of  skills to higher reasoning  research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill  mimic the probabilistic nature of the human ability to guess

 name knowledge representation  and  name knowledge engineering  are central to ai research many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world among the things that ai needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects name representing categories and relations  situations events states and time name representing time  causes and effects name representing causation  knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know name representing knowledge about knowledge  and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an  the set of objects relations concepts and so on that the machine knows about the most general are called  which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge name ontology 
among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are
 and the  many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions for example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is fist sized sings and flies none of these things are true about all birds  identified this problem in 1969 name qualification problem  as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problem name default reasoning and non monotonic logic 
the breadth of  the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of  eg  require enormous amounts of laborious —they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time name breadth of commonsense knowledge  a major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontology
the subsymbolic form of some  much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed  or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake  these are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non consciously and sub symbolically name intuition  knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of sub symbolic reasoning it is hoped that   or  will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge name intuition

intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them name planning  they need a way to visualize the future they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the  or value of the available choices name information value theory 
in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be name classical planning  however if the agent is not the only actor it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty name non deterministic planning

afro celt sound system is a  which fuses modern    etc with traditional  and  music it was originally formed in 1995 by  nominated producer guitarist  and features a wide range of guest artists name allmusic 
their albums have been released through s  and they have frequently performed at  festivals worldwide their sales on the label are exceeded only by gabriel himself their recording contract with real world was for five albums of which volume 5 anatomic was the last name jazzmann 
after a number of festival dates in 2007 the band went on hiatus in 2010 they regrouped to play a number of shows including a return to womad  releasing a re mastered retrospective titled capture 
on the 20 may 2014 afro celt sound system launched a new website and with it announced the upcoming release of a new album born 
the inspiration behind the project dates back to 1991 when simon emmerson a  nominated british  and guitarist collaborated with afro pop star  while making an album with maal in senegal emmerson was struck by the similarity between one african melody and a traditional irish air back in london irish musician  told emmerson about a belief that nomadic celts lived in africa or india before they migrated to western europe whether or not the theory was true emmerson was intrigued by the two countries musical affinities
in an experiment that would prove successful emmerson brought two members of baaba maals band together with traditional irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create adding a dash of modern sound emmerson also brought in english dance mixers for an electronic beat people thought i was mad when i touted the idea emmerson told jim carroll of  at the time i was out of favour with the london club scene i was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary
jamming in the studios at real world musician peter gabriels recording facilities in  the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week this album  was released by real world records in 1996 and marked the debut of the afro celt sound system an energetic global fusion the likes of which the music world had not yet seen
prior to that first album being made none of us knew if it would work musician james mcnally told larry katz of the boston herald we were strangers who didnt even speak the same language but we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language mcnally who grew up second generation irish in london played whistles keyboards piano  and bamboo flute
sound magic has now sold over 300000 copies the band performed at festivals raves and dance clubs and regularly included two african musicians moussa sissokho on talking drum and djembe and  on vocals  and 
just as the second album was getting off the ground one of the groups core musicians 27 year old   son of  bass player  died suddenly of an  attack the band was devastated and the album was put on hold then irish pop star  came to the rescue collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss oconnor blew into the studio on a windy november night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful mcnally told katz we had this track we didnt know what to do with sinéad scribbled a few lyrics and bang she left us completely choked up so taken was the band with oconnors song release that they used the name for the title of their album  hit the music stores in 1999 and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide
in 2000 the group was nominated for a  in the best world music category the band composed at the time of eight members from six countries england  guinea ireland france and  took pride in its ability to bring people together through music we can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that were at home mcnally told patrick macdonald of  were breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music we leave a door open to communicate with each others traditions and its changed our lives
in 2001 the group released  which climbed to number one on billboards top world music albums chart featuring guest spots by peter gabriel and  the album also incorporated a heightened african sound on the first two records the pendulum swung more toward the celtic london club side of the equation emmerson told the irish timess carroll for this one we wanted to have more african vocals and input than wed done before again the afro celt sound system met with success chuck taylor of billboard magazine praised the album as a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music the single  with vocals by gabriel became a radio hit in the united states
in 2003 for the  album they temporarily changed their name to the simpler afrocelts this was subsequently regarded as a mistake and they reverted to the longer and more familiar band name for their subsequent albums  a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums  their fifth studio album and 
they played a number of shows to promote volume 5 anatomic in 2006 and summer 2007 ending with a gig in korea  before taking an extended break to work on side projects amongst them  featuring simon emmerson and johnny kalsi starting in the summer of 2010 the band performed a series of live shows to promote a new 2 cd album  released on 6 september 2010 on real world records further performances continue to the present day and a new album in progress titled born was announced on their website in 2014

genuinely philosophical thought depending upon original individual insights arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously  termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century bce an  in human thought
chinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in china and other countries within the  that  including japan  and 
 
the hundred schools of thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 bcehttp  wwwbritannicacom ebchecked topic 112694 chinese philosophy#171469 chinese philosophy encyclopaedia britannica accessed 4 6 2014  an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in china even though this period – known in its earlier part as the  period and the  period – in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles it is also known as the golden age of  because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely the thoughts and ideas discussed and ined during this period have profoundly influenced s and  up to the present day in east asian countries the  society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of   and  this period ended with the rise of the  and the subsequent  of dissent the  lists ten major schools they are
  which teaches that human beings are teachable improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self cultivation and self creation a main idea of confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection confucianism holds that one should give up ones life if necessary either passively or actively for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of  and  
  which maintained that human nature was incorrigibly selfish accordingly the only way to preserve the social order was to impose discipline from above and to see to a strict enforcement of laws the legalists exalted the state above all seeking its prosperity and martial prowess over the welfare of the common people
  a philosophy which emphasizes the    and  while taoist thought generally focuses on  the relationship between humanity and the cosmos  and  and  action through inaction harmony with the  or the source thereof tao is the intended result of many taoist rules and practices
  which advocated the idea of universal love mozi believed that everyone is equal before heaven and that people should seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love his epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist  he believed that human cognition ought to be based on ones perceptions  ones sensory experiences such as sight and hearing  instead of imagination or internal logic elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction mozi advocated frugality condemning the confucian emphasis on ritual and music which he denounced as extravagant
 naturalism the  or the yin yang school which synthesized the concepts of  and the    is considered the founder of this school 
 agrarianism or the  which advocated peasant   and  name wp  the agrarians believed that chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king  a folk hero which was portrayed in chinese literature as working in the fields along with everyone else and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached name wp  
 the  or the school of names which focused on  and  it is said to have parallels with that of the ancient greek  or s the most notable logician was 
 the  or school of vertical and horizontal alliances which focused on practical matters instead of any moral principle so it stressed political and diplomatic tactics and debate and lobbying skill scholars from this school were good orators debaters and tacticians
 the miscellaneous school which integrated teachings from different schools for instance  found scholars from different schools to write a book called  cooperatively this school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws
 the school of minor talks which was not a unique school of thought but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street
 another group is the school of the military that studied strategy and the   and  were influential leaders however this school was not one of the ten schools defined by hanshu
 
the founder of the  who implemented legalism as the official philosophy  legalism remained influential until the emperors of the  adopted daoism and later confucianism as official doctrine these latter two became the determining forces of chinese thought until the introduction of buddhism
confucianism was particularly strong during the han dynasty whose greatest  was  who integrated confucianism with the thoughts of the zhongshu school and the theory of the five elements he also was a promoter of the new text school which considered confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of china who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the universal peace in contrast there was an old text school that advocated the use of confucian works written in ancient language from this comes the denomination old text that were so much more reliable in particular they uted the assumption of confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage but simply a human and mortal
the 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the  mysterious learning also called neo taoism the most important philosophers of this movement were   and  the main question of this school was whether being came before not being in chinese ming and wuming a peculiar feature of these taoist thinkers like the  was the concept of  lit wind and flow a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse
 arrived in china around the 1st century ad but it was not until the   and  dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement at the beginning it was considered a sort of taoist sect and there was even a theory about  founder of taoism who went to india and taught his philosophy to   was far more successful in china than its rival  and both indian schools and local chinese sects arose from the 5th century two chiefly important monk philosophers were  and  but probably the most influential and original of these schools was the  sect which had an even stronger impact in japan as the  sect

the ancient indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions   tradition and vedic tradition
indian philosophy begins with the  where questions related to laws of nature the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked in the famous    the poet says
 whence all creation had its origin
 he whether he fashioned it or whether he did not
 he who surveys it all from highest heaven
 he knows—or maybe even he does not know
in the  view creation is ascribed to the self consciousness of the primeval being purusha this leads to the inquiry into the one being that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things  cosmic order is termed rta and causal law by karma nature prakriti is taken to have three qualities   and 
 
 
 
 and  are continuation of the sramana school of thought the sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities they laid stress on philosophical concepts like ahimsa karma jnana samsara and moksa  sanskrit चार्वाक atheist philosophy  also known as lokāyata it is a system of hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference it is named after its founder cārvāka author of the bārhaspatya sūtras
in classical times these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy some of the questions asked were
 what is the ontological nature of consciousness
 how is cognition itself experienced
 is mind chit intentional or not
 does cognition have its own structure

anaximander   anaximandros c 610 – c 546 bc was a   philosopher who lived in  name chambersanaximander in  london  1961 vol 1 p 403  a city of  in modern day turkey he belonged to the  and learned the teachings of his master  he succeeded thales and became the second master of that school where he counted  and arguably  amongst his pupils 
little of his life and work is known today according to available historical documents he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies oratio 36 §317  although only one fragment of his work remains fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man
he was an early proponent of  and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe with a particular interest in its origins claiming that nature is ruled by laws just like human societies and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last longpark david 2005 the grand contraption princeton university press isbn 0 691 12133 8  like many thinkers of his time anaximanders contributions to  relate to many disciplines in  he tried to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the earth in physics his postulation that the indefinite or  was the source of all things led greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction his knowledge of  allowed him to introduce the  in greece he created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of  he was also involved in the  of miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies
anaximander son of praxiades was born in the third year of the 42nd  610 bc name refutation   i 5  according to  greek grammarian of the 2nd century bc he was sixty four years old during the second year of the 58th olympiad 547–546ampnbspbc and died shortly afterwardsin his chronicles as reported by   ii 2 
establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible since no document provides chronological erences  a 4th century  ian mentions that he was the first of the known greeks to publish a written document on nature theore his texts would be amongst the earliest written in  at least in the western world by the time of  his philosophy was almost forgotten and  his successor  and a few  provide us with the little information that remains however we know from aristotle that thales also from miletus precedes anaximander it is debatable whether thales actually was the teacher of anaximander but there is no doubt that anaximander was influenced by thales theory that everything is derived from water one thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient greeks considered anaximander to be from the monist school which began in miletus with thales followed by anaximander and finished with richard d mckirahan philosophy before socrates ch 5 32–34   3rd century  rhetorician  depicts him as leader of the milesian colony to  on the  coast and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen indeed various history iii 17 explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters it is very likely that leaders of miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony’s allegiance
anaximanders theories were influenced by the  tradition and by some ideas of ampnbsp– the father of philosophyampnbsp– as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the east especially by the babylonian astrologersc mosse 1984 la grece archaique d homere a eschyle edition du seuil p236  all these were elaborated rationally in his desire to find some universal principle he assumed like traditional religion the existence of a cosmic order and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality this was a common practice for the greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere theore they could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic systemc m bowra 1957 the greek experience world publishing company cleveland and new york p168169 
some scholars saw a gap between the existing mythical and the new  way of thought which is the main characteristic of the  8th to 6th century bc in the greek  claims anaximander has the first european philosophical conception of god a beginners history of philosophy volume 1 pg 24  because of this they did not hesitate to speak for a greek miracle but if we follow caully the course of anaximanders ideas we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears the basic elements of nature     which the first greek philosophers believed that constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony in the old cosmogoniesampnbsp–  8thampnbsp– 7th centuryampnbspbc and  6th century bcampnbsp–  establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony the  anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not  but  and this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe this is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in naturec mosse 1984 la grece archaique dhomere a eschyle edition du seuil p 235  in this space there is isonomy equal rights and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable the decisions are now taken by the assembly of  in the  which is lying in the middle of the cityj p vernart 1982 les origins de la pensee grecque puf pariw p 128 j p vernart 1982 the origins of the greek thought cornell university press

the refutation attributed to  i 5 and the later 6th century byzantine philosopher  attribute to anaximander the earliest use of the word apeíron  infinite or limitless to designate the original principle he was the first philosopher to employ in a philosophical context the term   which until then had meant beginning or origin for him it became no longer a mere point in time but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be the indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in  indefinite sea and as in  6th century bc who said that the earth went down indefinitely to apeiron ie beyond the imagination or concept of men 
aristotle writes  i iii 3–4 that the  were searching for the element that constitutes all things while each pre socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element  for thales and  for anaximenes anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless unlimited primordial mass apeiron subject to neither old age nor decay that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived the doctrines of the philosophers i 3  he proposed the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher thales who had claimed that the primary substance was water the notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and anaximanders description was in terms appropriate to this conception this arche is called eternal and ageless hippolytus  refutation i6idk b2 
for anaximander the  of things the constituent of all substances is nothing determined and not an element such as water in thales view neither is it something halfway between air and water or between air and fire thicker than air and fire or more subtle than water and earth  ii 5  anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example water can only be wet never dry — and theore cannot be the one primary substance nor could any of the other candidates he postulated the apeiron as a substance that although not directly perceptible to us could explain the opposites he saw around him
anaximander explains how the  of ancient physics    and  are formed and how earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions unlike other pre socratics he never defines this principle precisely and it has generally been understood eg by aristotle and by  as a sort of primal  according to him the universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter it embraces the opposites of hot and cold wet and dry and directs the movement of things an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in all the worlds for he believed there were many
anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came apeiron the one surviving fragment of anaximanders writing deals with this matter simplicius transmitted it as a quotation which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements comments on aristotles physics 24 13
 
in  quotes usually blend with surrounding text consequently deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult however it is generally accepted that this quote is not simplicius own interpretation   but anaximanders writing in somewhat poetic terms as it is mentioned by simplicius curd patricia a presocratics reader selected fragments and testimonia  1996 p 12

simplicius mentions that anaximander said all these in poetic terms meaning that he used the old mythical language the goddess justice  keeps the cosmic order
this concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards notably by aristotlearistotle metaphysics i 3 983 b 8–11  iii 5 204 b 33–34  and by the greek   what comes from earth must return to eartheuripides v 532    in his  stated that anaximander viewed  all coming to be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being a wrong for which destruction is the only penance  1873 § 4  physicist  in commenting upon s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of  are to be seen as different manifestations different quantum states of one and the same “primordial substance” proposed that this primordial substance be called apeiron 
anaximanders bold use of non  explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as  it confirms that pre socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demythify physical processes his major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the  and the origins of  for this he is often called the father of  and founder of astronomy however  states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deitiespseudo plutarch doctrines of the philosophers i 7 
anaximander was the first to conceive a  model of the  in his model the  floats very still in the centre of the infinite not supported by anything it remains in the same place because of its indifference a point of view that aristotle considered ingenious but false in aristotle on the heavens ii 13  its curious shape is that of a a column of stone  reports in de fide iii 7 1 or similar to a pillar shaped stone pseudo plutarch iii 10  with a height one third of its diameter the flat top forms the inhabited world which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass
anaximanders realization that the earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinkingcarlo rovelli the first scientist anaximander and his legacy yardley westholme 2011 daniel w graham explaining the cosmos the ionian tradition of scientific philosophy princeton nj princeton university press 2006  karl popper calls this idea one of the boldest most revolutionary and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinkingkarl popper conjectures and refutations the growth of scientific knowledge new york routledge 1998 pg 186   such a model allowed the concept that  could pass under the earth opening the way to greek astronomy
at the origin after the separation of  a ball of flame appeared that surrounded earth like bark on a tree this ball broke apart to form the rest of the universe it resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels filled with fire with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute consequently the  was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the earth on the farthest wheel and an eclipse corresponded with the  of that hole the diameter of the solar wheel was twenty seven times that of the earth or twenty eight depending on the sourcesin refutation it is reported that the circle of the sun is twenty seven times bigger than the moon  and the  wheel whose fire was less intense eighteen or nineteen times its hole could change shape thus explaining s the s and the s located closeraetius de fide ii 15 6  followed the same modelmost of anaximanders model of the universe comes from pseudo plutarch ii 20–28
 the sun is a circle twenty eight times as big as the earth with the outline similar to that of a fire filled chariot wheel on which appears a mouth in certain places and through which it exposes its fire as through the hole on a flute  the sun is equal to the earth but the circle on which it breathes and on which its born is twenty seven times as big as the whole earth  the eclipse is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed  the moon is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth all filled with fire like that of the sun 
anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the sun as a huge mass and consequently to realize how far from earth it might be and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances furthermore according to diogenes laertius ii 2 he built a  this invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the  of the  as the roman philosopher  reports in  ii 8 it is a little early to use the term  but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the earth to explain the seasons the  and theologian aetius attributes to pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity
according to simplicius anaximander already speculated on the plurality of s similar to   and  and later philosopher  these thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while and that some were born when others perished they claimed that this movement was eternal for without movement there can be no generation no destructionsimplicius commentary on aristotles physics 1121 5–9 
in addition to simplicius hippolytushippolytus  refutation i 6  reports anaximanders claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is erring to the worlds withinnotably pseudo plutarch iii 2 and aetius i 3 3 i 7 12 ii 1 3 ii 1 8  which are often infinite in quantity  writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worldson the nature of the gods i 10 25
 anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque eosque innumerabiles esse mundos
 for anaximander gods were born but the time is long between their birth and their death and the worlds are countless 
this theory places anaximander close to the atomists and the  who more than a century later also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared in the  some thinkers conceptualized a single world plato aristotle  and  while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds continuous or non continuous anaximenes heraclitus  and 
anaximander attributed some phenomena such as  and  to the intervention of elements rather than to divine causespseudo plutarch iii 3
 anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud then by its subtlety and lightness the rupture produces the sound and the scattering because of the darkness of the cloud creates the light  in his system thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame but strong enough to produce a sound a flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls allowing a less active fire to break free thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flowaccording to  naturales quaestiones ii 18 
he saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded earthpseudo plutarch iii 16  a part of that mass evaporated under the suns action thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundantit is then very likely that by observing the moon and the tides anaximander thought the latter were the cause and not the effect of the satellites movement  he explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from earth by the sun name refutation   for him the earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions which someday would go dry as well according to aristotles  ii 3 democritus also shared this opinion
anaximander speculated about the beginnings and  of animal life taking into account the existence of fossils  he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago the first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark but as they got older the bark would dry up and breakpseudo plutarch v 19  as the early humidity evaporated dry land emerged and in time humankind had to adapt the 3rd century roman writer  reports
anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the earths climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales also mentions anaximanders theory that humans were born inside fish feeding like sharks and that when they could defend themselves they were thrown ashore to live on dry land  he thought that considering humans extended infancy we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently
both  and  later greek geographers claim that according to the geographer  anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world the map probably inspired the greek historian  to draw a more accurate version strabo viewed both as the first geographers after 
maps were produced in ancient times also notably in   the  and  only some small examples survived until today the unique example of a world map comes from late babylonian tablet  later than 9th century bce but is based probably on a much older map these maps indicated directions roads towns borders and geological features anaximanders innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient greeks
such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasonsas established by marcel conche anaximandre fragments et témoignages introduction pampnbsp43–47  first it could be used to improve navigation and trade between s colonies and other colonies around the mediterranean sea and black sea second  would probably have found it easier to convince the ionian  to join in a federation in order to push the  threat away if he possessed such a tool finally the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one
surely aware of the seas convexity he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface the centre or “navel” of the world  omphalós gẽs could have been  but is more likely in anaximanders time to have been located near miletus the  was near the maps centre and enclosed by three continents themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers  was bordered on the south by the  and was separated from  by the black sea the  and further east either by the  now called the rioni or the  the  flowed south into the ocean separating  which was the name for the part of the then known n continent from asia
the  relates that anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry it also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in  of the gnomon in  he participated in the construction or at least in the adjustment of s to indicate s and esthese accomplishments are often attributed to him notably by diogenes laertius ii 1 and by the roman historian   x 14 11  indeed a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude
in his time the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane the position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day as it moves through its apparent course the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow which is shortest at noon when pointing due south the variation in the tip’s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice
the invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to anaximander because its use as well as the division of days into twelve parts came from the ns it is they according to   ii 109 who gave the greeks the art of time measurement it is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices because no calculation is necessary on the other hand equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices as the babylonians thought as the suda seems to suggest it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry he became the first greek to accurately determine the equinoxes
in his philosophical work  i 50 112 cicero states that anaximander convinced the inhabitants of  to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was nearhttp  wwwthelatinlibrarycom cicero divinatione1shtml da divinatione in latin  the city collapsed when the top of the  split like the stern of a ship pliny the elder also mentions this anecdote ii 81 suggesting that it came from an admirable inspiration as opposed to cicero who did not associate the prediction with divination
 in the  interprets anaximanders theories as    the above quote as   clarify probably due to editing the quote erenced here is unclear    an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth fire and water all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements that where there was fire ashes earth now existbertrand russell a history of western philosophy and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day new york simon and schuster 1946  his greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate
 in  claimed that anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness in accordance with this anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness in other words anaximander viewed all coming to be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being a wrong for which destruction is the only penance ibid § 4 the world of individual objects in this way of thinking has no worth and should perishfriedrich nietzsche philosophy in the tragic age of the greeks washington dc regnery gateway 1962

according to the sudathemistius and simplicius also mention some work on nature the list could er to book titles or simply their topics again no one can tell because there is no punctuation sign in ancient greek furthermore this list is incomplete since the suda ends it with  thus implying other works

an architect is a person who plans designs and oversees the  of   to practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design and construction of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use  removed bit about human use as obvious in most architectural work except for animal shelters zoos etc   name nscahttp  wwwgovnsca legislature legc bills 60th_1st 3rd_read b115htm  etymologically architect derives from the latin architectus which derives from the greek  arkhi  chief + tekton builder ie chief builderhttp  wwwetymonlinecom indexphpterm architect online etymology of the term architect 
professionally an architects decisions affect public safety and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum or internship for practical experience to earn a  to practice  practical technical and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction see below

throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by s—such as stone s and s rising to the role of master builder until modern times there was no clear distinction between architect and  in europe the titles architect and engineer were primarily geographical variations that erred to the same person often used interchangeablyhttps  booksgooglecom booksid vqyehmgp2gwcampq the+architecture+of+the+italian+renaissanceampdq the+architecture+of+the+italian+renaissanceamppgis 1 the architecture of the italian renaissance jacob burckhardt isbn 0 8052 1082 2 http  wwwsmwengcom civil engineering definitions and history civil engineering defined 
it is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional gentleman architect separate from the hands on craftsman paper was not used in europe for drawing until the 15th century but became increasingly available after 1500 pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600 the availability of both allowed pre construction drawings to be made by professionals name mad 225  concurrently the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three dimensional building in two dimensions together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy helped building designers communicate their ideas name mad 225   however the development was gradual until the 18th century buildings continued to be designed and set out by craftsmen with the exception of high status projects name mad 225  
in most developed countries only qualified people with appropriate license certification or registration with a relevant body often governmental may legally practice architecture such licensure usually requires an accredited university degree successful completion of exams and a training period the use of terms and titles and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law although in general derivatives such as  are not legally protected
to practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision the term  professional or design professional by contrast is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession such as  professionals or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect such as s and s in many places independent non licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions such design houses and other smaller structures
in the architectural profession technical and environmental knowledge design and construction management and an understanding of business are as important as design however design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond an architect accepts a commission from a client the commission might involve preparing feasibility reports building audits the design of a building or of several buildings structures and the spaces among them the architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building throughout the project planning to occupancy the architect co ordinates a design team   and s and other specialists are hired by the client or the architect who must ensure that the work is co ordinated to construct the design
the architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use in that the architect must meet with and question the client to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking the architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief the program or brief is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner — it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept
it is generally expected that the design proposals is both imaginative as well as pragmatic but the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary depending on the place time finance culture and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place
design of buildings is a very complex and demanding undertaking no matter what the scale of the project might be a strong degree of foresight is a prerequisite any design concept must at a very early stage in its generation take into account a great number of issues and variables which include qualities of spaceshttps  wwwacademiaedu 2061334 space_the_undefinable_space_of_architecture  the end use and life cycle of these proposed spaces connections relations and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks such as higher than expected costs which may occur later the site and its environs as well as the culture and history of the place will also influence the design the design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability the architect may introduce intentionally or not to greater or lesser degrees aspects of  new or current  or erences to 
a key part of design is that the architect often consults with engineers surveyors and other specialists throughout the design ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole the control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication including advanced computer technology such as bim building information management cad and cloud based technologies
at all times in the design the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations introducing a further variable into the design
architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and s the architect might need to comply with local  and  laws such as required setbacks height limitations parking requirements transparency requirements windows and  some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and  guidelines health and safety risks form a vital part of current design and in many jurisdictions design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants waste management and recycling traffic control and fire safety
previously architects employed drawings name mad 225  to illustrate and generate  design proposals while conceptual sketches are still widely used by architectshttp  wwwarchdailycom 639533 17 napkin sketches by famous architects  computer technology has now become the industry standardhttp  wwwslatecom articles arts architecture 2011 03 think_before_you_buildhtml  however design may include the use of photos collages prints lino cuts and other media in design production 
increasingly computer software such as  is shaping how architects work bim technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life cycle of the buildings design construction and maintenance 
as current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions increase energy efficiency and make use of renewable energy sources renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers as a result the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations which are continually tightening some new developments exhibit extremely low energy usehttp  passipediaorg basics what_is_a_passive_house 
however the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense such as making provision for low energy transport natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting natural ventilation instead of air conditioning pollution and waste management use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future
as the design becomes more advanced and detailed specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building techniques in the production of building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances
depending on the clients needs and the jurisdictions requirements the spectrum of the architects services during construction stages may be extensive detailed document preparation and construction review or less involved such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable  functions
architects typically put projects to  on behalf of their clients advise on the award of the project to a  facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor this contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders the status of the design documents provisions for the architects access and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed depending on the type of contract utilized provisions for further sub contract tenders may be required the architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material product or work
in most jurisdictions prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections the architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority
the architect will typically review   and other  prepare and issue site instructions and provide certificates for payment to the contractor see also  which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired in the  and other countries a  is often part of the team to provide cost consulting with very large complex projects an independent  is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction
in many jurisdictions mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required this demand for certification entails a high degree of risk   theore regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions
recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types for example health care retail public housing event management technological expertise or project delivery methods some architects specialize as     us or conservation uk  and other forms of specialist consultants
many architects elect to move into  corporate facilities planning    or other related fields
although there are variations from place to place most of the worlds architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction to do so architects are typically required to meet three common requirements education experience and examination
educational requirements generally consist of a  in architecture the experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship usually two to three years depending on jurisdiction finally a registration examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure
professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting instead they often trained under established architects prior to modern times there was no distinction between architects s and often s and the title used varied depending on geographical location they often carried the title of  or  after serving a number of years as an apprentice such as sir  the formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory

in strict analysis abbreviations should not be confused with  s or initialisms with which they share some  and  functions though all four are connoted by the term abbreviation in loose parlance name harts an abbreviation is a shortening by any method a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts a contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part a contraction is an abbreviation but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations eg by the  they are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words
abbreviations have a long history used so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided this might be done to save time and space and also to provide secrecy shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications in classical  and  the reduction of words to single letters was commonhttps  booksgooglecom booksid ha9kaaaamaajamppg pa5ampdq abbreviations+historyamphl enampsa xampei d2naviita6vbsasp94dgagampved 0cdoq6aewba#v onepageampq abbreviations%20historyampf false the british cyclopaedia of the arts sciences history geography literature natural history and biography wm s orr and company 1838 p5  in roman inscriptions words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation however some could have more than one meaning depending on their context for example a can be an abbreviation for many words such as ager amicus annus as aulus aurelius aurum and avusadkins l https  booksgooglecom booksid zgy1sqjwf8kcampdq abbreviations++fashionableampq abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v snippetampq abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22ampf false handbook to life in ancient rome infobase publishing 2004 p 261

during the growth of  linguistic theory in academic britain abbreviating became very fashionable the use of abbreviation for the names of  and his friend  and other members of the  literary group known as the  are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this likewise a century earlier in  a fad of abbreviation started that swept the united states with the globally popular term  generally credited as a remnant of its influence  
after  the british greatly reduced the use of the  and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi formal writing while the americans more readily kept such use until more recently and still maintain it more than britons the classic example considered by their american counterparts quite curious was the maintenance of the internal comma in a british organisation of secret agents called the —soe—which is not found in histories written after about 1960
but before that many britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the french form in  the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is not the last letter of its antecedent  m is the abbreviation for monsieur while mme is that for madame like many other cross  linguistic acquisitions many britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves while the americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously
over the years however the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not the us media tend to use periods in two word abbreviations like united states us but not  pc or  tv many british publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations
minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon film  since a period or comma consumed the same length of non reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter
widespread use of electronic communication through  and  during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation this was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as  and   for instance supports message lengths of 160 characters at most using the  character set this brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called  with which 10% or more of the words in a typical sms message are abbreviatedcrystal david  oxford oxford university press 2008 isbn 978 0 19 954490 5  more recently  a popular  began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits
in  there are several conventions for abbreviations and the choice may be confusing the only rule universally accepted is that one should be consistent and to make this easier publishers express their perences in a  questions which arise include those in the following subsections
if the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital for example lev for leviticus when a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization however when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken then all letters should be capitalized as in ytd for year to date pcb for printed circuit board and fyi for for your information however see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary these are no longer written with capital letters
a period full stop is often used to signify an abbreviation but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen
according to  the traditional rule is that abbreviations in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending and not the middle dropped terminate with a full stop whereas contractions in the sense of words missing a middle part do not but there are exceptions name harts   says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions but recommends against this practice advising them only for abbreviations and lower case initialisms and not for upper case initialisms and contractions

in  the period is usually included in some cases periods are optional as in either us or us for  united states eu or eu for european union and un or un for united nations there are some house styles however—american ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations for example
 the us  advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name for example northwest blvd w jefferson and ped xing all follow this recommendation 
  used in many s uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms with almost no exceptions thus         and hundreds of others contain no periods the only exceptions are  to avoid the appearance of  initials within persons names such as george r smith and st within persons names when the person pers it such as emily r st clair but not in city names such as st louis  or st paul ama style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into english from   other languages or  thus no italic for       or 
acronyms that were originally capitalized with or without periods but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods  examples are      and 
today spaces are generally not used between single letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase so one almost never encounters uampnbsps
when an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence only one period is used the capital of the united states is washington dc
there is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations particularly acronyms often a writer will add an s following an apostrophe as in pcs however this style is not perred by many style guides for instance kate turabian writing about style in academic writings name chicagoturabian k a manual for writers of research papers theses and dissertations 7th edition subsection 2012  allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters turabian would theore per dvds and urls and phds while the  name mlamodern language association mla handbook for writers of research papers 7th edition 2009 subsection 327g  explicitly says do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation  also the  specifically says name apapublication manual of the american psychological association apa 5th edition 2001 subsection 328  name autogenerated1publication manual of the american psychological association apa 6th edition 2010 subsection 429  without an apostrophe

however the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes
 the xs of the equation

in latin and continuing to the derivative forms in european languages as well as english single letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note taking most of these deal with writing and publishing a few longer abbreviations use this as well

publications based in the us tend to follow the style guides of  and the  the  follows a style guide published by the   the  sets the style for abbreviations of units
 
many british publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation
 for the sake of convenience many british publications including the  and  have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations these include
 social titles like ms or mr though these would usually not have had full stops—see above capt prof etc
 two letter abbreviations for countries us not us
 abbreviations beyond three letters full caps for all except initialisms
 words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters pr instead of pr or pr
 names fw de klerk gb whiteley park js  a notable exception is  which writes mr f w de klerk
 scientific units see measurement below
 acronyms are often erred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized for instance the  can be abbreviated as nato or nato and  as sars or sars compare with  which has made the full transition to an english word and is rarely capitalised at all
 initialisms are always written in capitals for example the british broadcasting corporation is abbreviated to bbc never bbc an initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word
 when abbreviating scientific units no space is added between the number and unit nowiki100mph 100m 10cm 10°c nowiki this is contrary to the si standard see below
 
 a doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some welsh names as in  the double l is a separate sound ll george for british prime minister 
 some titles such as reverend and honourable are spelt out when preceded by the rather than as rev or hon respectively  this is true for most british publications and some in the united states
 a repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage and  the elements of technical writing pg 53   1993 isbn 0020130856  abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided
writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure  such shorthand can be an abbreviation such as in for  or can be a symbol such as km for 
the shorthand in applies to english only—in  for example the shorthand dm is used for the equivalent afrikaans word duim  since both in and dm are contractions of the same word but in different languages they are abbreviations a symbol on the other hand defined as mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process  applies the appropriate shorthand by substitution rather than by contraction since the shorthand for kilometre  in portuguese or  in greek is km in both languages and the letter k does not appear in the expansion of either translation km is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction it is a  rather than an abbreviation
in the  si manual  the word symbol is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various si units of measure the manual also  the principal rules being
the conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1ampnbspmw megawatts is equal to 1000000000ampnbspmw milliwatts
no periods should be inserted between letters—for example ms which is an approximation of m·s which correctly uses  is the symbol for metres multiplied by seconds but ms is the symbol for milliseconds
no periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise for example a full stop at the end of a sentence
the singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter s to denote a plural
a syllabic abbreviation is an abbreviation formed from usually initial syllables of several words such as    international + police it is a variant of the acronym syllabic abbreviations are usually written using  sometimes starting with a  and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from s which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each
 
syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in english or french the  however often uses syllabic abbreviations as described below and some  government ministries such as  office  of communications and  office of telecommunications does use this style
on the other hand they prevailed in germany under the  and in the soviet union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations for example  stands for geheime staats polizei or secret state police similarly leninist organisations such as the  communist international and  kommunisticheskii soyuz molodyozhi or communist youth union used russian language syllabic abbreviations this has caused syllabic abbreviations to have negative connotations as in orwells  notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in germany even before the nazis came to power eg  for schutzpolizei
syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the  used in the  eg  for staatssicherheit state security the secret police or vopo for volkspolizist peoples policeman other uses are in company or product names such as   or 
east asian languages whose writing systems use  form abbreviations similarly by using key chinese characters from a term or phrase  for example in  the term for the  kokusai rengō 国際連合 is often abbreviated to kokuren 国連 such abbreviations are called  略語 in  see also  the syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities for instance běidà 北大 for běijīng dàxué 北京大学  and tōdai 東大 for tōkyō daigaku 東京大学   the english phrase  originated as a chinese abbreviation
 
partially syllabic abbreviations are perred by the us navy as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms hence  6 is used in the full capital form to mean destroyer squadron 6 while  would be commander naval air force in the atlantic

aphrodite     is the   of   pleasure and procreation her  is the goddess  name larlarousse desk reference encyclopedia  haydock 1995 p 215  she is identified with the planet 
as with many ancient greek deities there is more than one story about her origins according to s  she was born when  cut off s genitals and threw them into the sea and she arose from the sea foam aphros    thus aphrodite is of a generation older than    
according to s  she is the daughter of  and  according to  symposium 180e these two origins were of entirely separate entities  and 
because of her beauty other gods feared that their rivalry over her would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war so  married her to  who because of his ugliness and deformity was not seen as a threat aphrodite had many lovers—both gods such as  and men such as  she played a role in the  legend and later was both s lover and his surrogate mother many lesser beings were said to be children of aphrodite
aphrodite is also known as cytherea lady of cythera and cypris lady of cyprus after the two cult sites  and  which claimed to be her place of birth   s s s and s were said to be sacred to her the ancient greeks identified her with the ancient egyptian goddess reginald eldred witt isis in the ancient world johns hopkins university press 1997125

aphrodite had many other names such as acidalia cytherea and cerigo each used by a different local cult of the goddess in greece the greeks recognized all of these names as erring to the single goddess aphrodite despite the slight differences in what these local cults believed the goddess demanded of them the attic philosophers of the 4th century however drew a distinction between a celestial aphrodite aphrodite urania of transcendent principles and a separate common aphrodite who was the goddess of the people aphrodite pandemos
aphrodite perhaps altered after aphrós  foam stems from the more archaic  aphordíta and cypriot aphorodíta and was probably ultimately borrowed from cypriot  etymological dictionary of greek vol 1 leiden brill 2010 179   and  recorded that aphrodites oldest non greek temple lay in the syrian city of  where she was known as ourania an obvious erence to  this suggests that aphrodites cult located at   came from the phoenicians the fact that one of aphrodites chief centers of worship remained on the southwestern cypriot coast settled by phoenicians where the goddess had long been worshiped as  ʻštrt points to the transmission of aphrodites original cult from phoenicia to cyprus then to mainland greecepausanias 1146 7 ws jones trans pausianas descriptions of greece london 1931  so far however attempts to derive the name from aphrodites semitic precursor have been inconclusive
a number of  have been proposed through the ages  derives aphrodite from aphrós foam interpreting the name as risen from the foamhesiod  176ff kretschmer kz 33 1895 267  janda 2010 accepting this as genuine claims the foam birth myth as an  mytheme janda intereprets the name as a compound aphrós foam and déato  déato sic   she seems shines meaning she who shines from the foam ocean supposedly a byname of  the  name jandajanda michael die musik nach dem chaos innsbruck 2010 p 65  likewise mallory and adams 1997mallory jp and adams dq  london fitzroy dearborn publishing 1997  propose an indo european compound  very and  to shine also erring to eos however etymologies based on comparison with eos are unlikely since aphrodites attributes are entirely different from those of eos or the  charles penglase greek myths and mesopotamia parallels and influence in the homeric hymns and hesiod routledge 1997 164 citing deborah boedeker aphrodites entry into greek epic leiden brill 1974 15 6  finally the medieval  offers a highly contrived etymology deriving aphrodite from the compound habrodíaitos  she who lives delicately from habrós and díaita the alteration from b to ph is explained as a familiar characteristic of greek obvious from the etymologicum magnum Ἀφροδίτη  despite the fact that the name cannot be of macedonian origin
a number of improbable non greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship one semitic etymology compares aphrodite to the assyrian barīrītu the name of a female demon that appears in middle babylonian and late babylonian textssee chicago assyrian dictionary vol 2 pampnbsp111  hammarström 1921m hammarström glotta zeitschrift für griechische und lateinische sprache 11 1921 215f  looks to  comparing eprϑni lord an etruscan honorific loaned into greek as  this would make the theonym in origin an honorific the lady  and robert beekes 2010 rejects this etymology as implausible especially since aphrodite actually appears in etruscan in the borrowed form apru from greek aphrō clipped form of aphrodite
aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship   on the island of  which is why she is sometimes called cyprian especially in the poetic works of  however other versions of her myth have her born near the island of  hence another of her names cythereahomer odyssey viii 288 herodotus i 105 pausanias iii 23 § 1 anacreon v 9 horace carmina i 4 5  cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between  and the  so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of aphrodites cult from the  to mainland 
in the most famous version of her myth her birth was the consequence of a castration  severed  genitals and threw them behind him into the sea the foam from his genitals gave rise to aphrodite hence her name meaning foam arisen while the  furies and the  emerged from the drops of his blood   states that the genitals were carried over the sea a long time and white foam arose from the immortal flesh with it a girl grew the girl aphrodite floated ashore on a  shell this iconic representation of aphrodite as a mature venus rising from the sea Αναδυόμενη anadyómenē rising up  was made famous in a much admired painting by  now lost but described in the  of 
in another version of her origin bookampnbspv  she was considered a daughter of zeus and  the mother goddess whose oracle was at  aphrodite herself was sometimes also erred to as dione dione seems to be a feminine form of dios of zeus the  form case of  and could be taken to mean simply she that belongs to zeus in a generic sense aphrodite might then be an equivalent of  the  whom homer relocated to olympus
aphrodite is consistently portrayed in every image and story as having had no childhood and instead being born as a nubile infinitely desirable adult she is often depicted nude in many of the later myths she is portrayed as vain ill tempered and easily offended although she is married—she is one of the few gods in the  who is—she is frequently unfaithful to her husband
according to one version of aphrodites story because of her immense beauty zeus fears that the other gods will become violent with each other in their rivalry to possess her to forestall this he forces her to marry  the dour humorless god of smithing in another version of the story his mother  casts him off olympus deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit the home of the gods his revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne in return for her release he demands to be given aphrodites hand in marriage
hephaestus is overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty and forges her beautiful jewelry including the cestus a girdle that makes her even more irresistible to men her unhappiness with her marriage causes aphrodite to seek other male companionship most often ares but also sometimes 
aphrodites husband  is one of the most even tempered of the hellenic deities but in the  she is portrayed as perring  the volatile god of war because she is attracted to his violent nature
aphrodite is a major figure in the  legend she is a contestant in the judgement of paris see below which leads to the war she had been the lover of the trojan  and mother of his son  later during the war she saves aeneas from  who wounds her
the most prominent lover of aphrodite is  he is the child of   cursed by aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father king  of  after myrrhas mother bragged that her daughter is more beautiful than the goddess driven out after becoming pregnant myrrha is changed into a  tree but still gives birth to adonis
aphrodite finds the baby and takes him to the underworld to be fostered by  she returns for him when he is grown and strikingly handsome but persephone wants to keep him zeus decrees that adonis will spend a third of the year with aphrodite a third with persephone and a third with whomever he wishes adonis chooses aphrodite and they are constantly together
adonis who loves hunting is slain by a wild boar he bleeds to death and aphrodite can only mourn over his body she causes s to grow wherever his blood fell and decrees a festival on the anniversary of his death
the shade of adonis is received in the underworld by persephone aphrodite wants to return him to life again she and persephone bicker zeus intervenes again decreeing that adonis will spend six months with aphrodite and six months with persephone

in  a  r on a  x is antisymmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of x each of which is related by r to the other more formally r is antisymmetric precisely if for all a and b in x
if rab and rba then aampnbsp ampnbspb
or equivalently
if rab with aampnbsp≠ampnbspb then rba must not hold
as a simple example the  order on the s is an antisymmetric relation and what antisymmetry means here is that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are in fact the same number equivalently if n and m are distinct and n is a factor of m then m cannot be a factor of n
in  this is
math\forall a b \in x\ rab \and rba \ \rightarrow \ a   b math
or equivalently
   this is the same formula as above but due to the addition of the negation it is more clear where the term anti symmetric comes from   
math\forall a b \in x\ rab \and a \ne b \rightarrow \lnot  rba  math
the usual  ≤ on the s is antisymmetric if for two real numbers x and y both  xampnbsp≤ampnbspy and yampnbsp≤ampnbspx hold then x and y must be equal similarly  the  ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric given two sets a and b if every  in a also is in b and every element in b is also in a then a and b must contain all the same elements and theore be equal
matha \subseteq b \and b \subseteq a \rightarrow a   b math
 and s are antisymmetric by definition a relation can be both  and antisymmetric eg  and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric eg the preys on relation on biological 
antisymmetry is different from  which requires both antisymmetry and 
the relation x is even y is odd between a pair x y of s is antisymmetric
every  is also an antisymmetric relation

aleister crowley  born edward alexander crowley 12ampnbspoctober 1875 – 1ampnbspdecember 1947 was an english ist ian    and  he founded the religion and philosophy of  identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the  in the early 20th century
born to a wealthy  family in   crowley rejected this  faith to pursue an interest in  he was educated at the  where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry resulting in several publications some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a  further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life in 1898 he joined the esoteric  where he was trained in ceremonial magic by  and  moving to  by  in scotland he went mountaineering in mexico with  before studying  and  practices in india he married  and in 1904 they honeymooned in  egypt where crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named  who provided him with  a sacred text that served as the basis for thelema announcing the start of the Æon of horus the book declared that its followers should adhere to the code of do what thou wilt and seek to align themselves with their will through the practice of 
after  and a visit to india and china crowley returned to britain where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry novels and occult literature in 1907 he and  co founded a thelemite order the  through which they propagated the religion after spending time in algeria in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order the german based  oto rising to become the leader of its british branch which he ormulated in accordance with his thelemite beliefs through the oto thelemite groups were established in britain australia and north america crowley spent the  in the united states where he took up painting and campaigned for the german war effort against britain later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro german movement to assist the british intelligence services in 1920 he established the  a religious commune in  sicily where he lived with various followers his  lifestyle led to denunciations in the british press and the italian government evicted him in 1923 he divided the following two decades between france germany and england and continued to promote thelema until his death
crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime being a   and an   he was denounced in the popular press as the wickedest man in the world and labelled a  because of his embrace of the title the beast crowley has remained a highly influential figure over western esotericism and the counter culture and continues to be considered a prophet in thelema in 2002 a  poll ranked him as the seventy third 
crowley was born as edward alexander crowley at 30 clarendon square in  warwickshire on 12 october 1875 his father edward crowley 1834–87 was trained as an engineer but his share in a lucrative family brewing business crowleys alton ales had allowed him to retire before his son was born his mother emily bertha bishop 1848–1917 came from a devonshire somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son she described him as the beast a name that he revelled in the couple had been married at londons kensington registry office in november 1874 and were evangelical christians crowleys father had been born a  but had converted to the  a faction of a  group known as the  with emily joining him upon marriage crowleys father was particularly devout spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day following the death of their baby daughter in 1880 in 1881 the crowleys moved to  surrey at the age of 8 crowley was sent to ht habershons evangelical christian boarding school in  and then to ebor preparatory school in  run by the reverend henry darcy champney whom crowley considered a sadist
in march 1887 when crowley was 11 his father died of  crowley described this as a turning point in his life and he always maintained an admiration of his father describing him as his hero and his friend inheriting a third of his fathers wealth he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by champney crowleys family removed him from the school when he developed  he then attended  and  both of which he despised and left after a few terms he became increasingly sceptical regarding christianity pointing out  to his religious teachers and went against the christian morality of his upbringing by smoking masturbating and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted  sent to live with a brethren tutor in  he undertook chemistry courses at  crowley developed interests in  poetry and  and in 1894 climbed  before visiting the  and joining the  the following year he returned to the  climbing the     and 
having adopted the name of aleister over edward in october 1895 crowley began a three year course at  where he was entered for the   studying philosophy with approval from his personal tutor he changed to english literature which was not then part of the curriculum offered crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry particularly the works of  and  many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as  cambridge magazine and cantab he continued his mountaineering going on holiday to the alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898 often with his friend  and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the  without a guide these feats led to his recognition in the alpine mountaineering community
crowley later claimed to have had his first significant  while on holiday in stockholm in december 1896 several biographers including   and  believed that this was the result of crowleys first same sex sexual experience which enabled him to recognise his  at cambridge crowley maintained a vigorous sex life largely with female prostitutes from one of whom he caught  but eventually he took part in same sex activities despite  in october 1897 crowley met  president of the  and the two entered into a relationship they broke apart because pollitt did not share crowleys increasing interest in western esotericism a breakup that crowley would regret for many years
in 1897 crowley travelled to  in russia later claiming that he was trying to learn russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there biographers richard spence and tobias churton suggested that crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the british secret service speculating that he had been enlisted while at cambridge
in october 1897 a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and the futility of all human endeavour and crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult in march 1898 he obtained s the book of black magic and of pacts 1898 and then s the cloud upon the sanctuary 1896 furthering his occult interests
in 1898 crowley privately published 100 copies of his poem aceldama a place to bury strangers in but it was not a particular success that same year he published a string of other poems including  a  collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the british authorities in july 1898 he left cambridge not having taken any degree at all despite a  showing in his 1897 exams and consistent second class honours results before that
in august 1898 crowley was in  switzerland where he met the chemist  and the two began discussing their common interest in  back in london baker introduced crowley to  bakers brother in law and a fellow member of the occult society known as the  which had been founded in 1888 crowley was initiated into the outer order of the golden dawn on 18 november 1898 by the groups leader  the ceremony took place in the golden dawns isis urania temple held at londons mark masons hall where crowley took the magical motto and name frater perdurabo which he interpreted as i shall endure to the end biographers richard spence and tobias churton have suggested that crowley joined the order under the command of the british secret services to monitor the activities of mathers who was known to be a 
crowley moved into his own luxury flat at 67–69  and soon invited a senior golden dawn member  to live with him as his personal magical tutor bennett taught crowley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs and together they performed the rituals of the  until bennett left for south asia to study  in november 1899 crowley purchased  in  on the shore of  in scotland he developed a love of scottish culture describing himself as the laird of boleskine and took to wearing traditional highland dress even during visits to london he continued writing poetry publishing jezebel and other tragic poems tales of archais songs of the spirit appeal to the american republic and jephthah in 1898–99 most gained mixed reviews from literary critics although jephthah was considered a particular critical success
crowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the golden dawn and was ready to enter the groups inner second order he was unpopular in the group his bisexuality and  lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation and he had developed feuds with some of the members including  when the golden dawns london lodge used to initiate crowley into the second order he visited mathers in paris who personally admitted him into the adeptus minor grade a schism had developed between mathers and the london members of the golden dawn who were unhappy with his autocratic rule acting under mathers orders crowley – with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate  – attempted to seize the vault of the adepts a temple space at 36 blythe road in  from the london lodge members when the case was taken to court the judge ruled in favour of the london lodge as they had paid for the spaces rent leaving both crowley and mathers isolated from the group spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine mathers authority
in 1900 crowley travelled to mexico via the united states settling in  and taking a local woman as his mistress developing a love of the country he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic working with s  invocations he later claimed to have been initiated into  while in the city and spending time writing he wrote a play based on s  as well as a series of poems published as oracles 1905 eckenstein joined him later that year and together they climbed several mountains including   and  the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore mexican oil prospects for british intelligence leaving mexico crowley headed to  before sailing for hawaii aboard the nippon maru on the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named mary alice rogers claiming to have fallen in love with her he wrote a series of poems about the romance published as alice an adultery 1903
briefly stopping at japan and hong kong crowley reached ceylon where he met with allan bennett who was there studying  the pair spent some time in  before bennett decided to become a buddhist monk in the  tradition travelling to burma to do so crowley decided to tour india devoting himself to the hindu practice of  from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of  he spent much of this time studying at the  in  and also wrote poetry which was published as the sword of song 1904 he contracted  and had to recuperate from the disease in calcutta and rangoon in 1902 he was joined in india by eckenstein and several other mountaineers guy knowles h pfannl vampnbspwesseley and  together the eckenstein crowley expedition attempted  which had never been climbed on the journey crowley was afflicted with  malaria and  and other expedition members were also struck with illness they reached an altitude of  before turning back

in february 1904 crowley and rose arrived in  claiming to be a prince and princess they rented an apartment in which crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient egyptian deities while studying ic  and  according to crowleys later account rose regularly became delirious and informed him they are waiting for you on 18 march she explained that they were the god  and on 20 march proclaimed that the equinox of the gods has come she led him to a nearby museum where she showed him a seventh century bce mortuary  known as the  crowley thought it important that the exhibits number was 666 the  in christian belief and in later years termed the artefact the stele of revealing
according to crowleys own later claims on 8 april he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of  an entity who was the messenger of horus or  crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days and titled it liber l vel legis or  the book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new  and that crowley would serve as its  it stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this aeon do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law and that people should learn to live in tune with their will this book and the philosophy that it espoused became the cornerstone of crowleys religion  crowley claimed that at the time he had been unsure what to do with the book of the law often resenting it he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform which included taking the stele of revealing from the museum fortifying his own island and translating the book into all the worlds languages according to his account he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew putting the manuscript itself away and ignoring it
returning to boleskine crowley came to believe that mathers had begun using magic against him and the relationship between the two broke down on 28 july 1905 rose gave birth to crowleys first child a daughter named lilith with crowley authoring the pornographic snowdrops from a curates garden to entertain his recuperating wife he also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry naming it the society for the propagation of religious truth in parody of the  among its first publications were crowleys collected works edited by  his poetry often received strong reviews either positive or negative but never sold well in an attempt to gain more publicity he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work the winner of this was  a british army officer and military historian whose essay the star in the west 1907 heralded crowleys poetry as some of the greatest ever written
crowley decided to climb  in the himalayas of nepal widely recognised as the worlds most treacherous mountain assembling a team consisting of  charles adolphe reymond alexis pache and alcesti c rigo de righi  was marred by much argument between crowley and the others who thought that he was reckless they eventually mutinied against crowleys control with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite crowleys warnings that it was too dangerous subsequently pache and several porters were killed in an accident something for which crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community
spending time in  where he took part in  and wrote the homoerotic work the scented garden crowley met up with rose and lilith in  before being forced to leave india after shooting dead a native man who tried to mug him briefly visiting bennett in burma crowley and his family decided to tour southern china hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose spence has suggested that this trip to china was orchestrated as part of a british intelligence scheme to monitor the regions opium trade crowley smoked opium throughout the journey which took the family from  through to    and then  on the way he spent much time on spiritual and magical work reciting the bornless ritual an invocation to his  on a daily basis
while rose and lilith returned to europe crowley headed to shanghai to meet old friend elaine simpson who was fascinated by the book of the law together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact aiwass crowley then sailed to japan and canada before continuing to new york city where he unsuccessfully solicited support for a second expedition up kangchenjunga upon arrival in britain crowley learned that his daughter lilith had died of  in  something he later blamed on roses increasing alcoholism under emotional distress his health began to suffer and he underwent a series of surgical operations he began short lived romances with actress vera lola neville née sneppkaczynski 2010 p 160   and author  while rose gave birth to crowleys second daughter lola zaza in february 1907
with his old mentor george cecil jones crowley continued performing  at the ashdown park hotel in  surrey crowley claimed that in doing so he attained  or union with godhead thereby marking a turning point in his life making heavy use of  during these rituals he wrote an essay on the psychology of hashish 1909 in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism he also claimed to have been contacted once again by aiwass in late october and november 1907 adding that aiwass dictated two further texts to him liber vii and liber cordis cincti serpente both of which were later classified in the corpus of  crowley wrote down more thelemic holy books during the last two months of the year including liber lxvi liber arcanorum liber porta lucis sub figura x liber tau liber trigrammaton and liber dcccxiii vel ararita which he again claimed to have received from a preternatural source crowley claimed that in june 1909 when the manuscript of the book of the law was rediscovered at boleskine he developed the opinion that thelema represented 
crowleys inheritance was running out trying to earn money he was hired by george montagu bennett the  to help protect him from  recognising bennetts paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction crowley took him on holiday to france and morocco to recuperate in 1907 he also began taking in paying students whom he instructed in occult and magical practice  whom crowley met in february 1907 became his sexual partner and closest disciple in 1908 the pair toured northern spain before heading to  morocco the following year neuburg stayed at boleskine where he and crowley engaged in  crowley continued to write prolifically producing such works of poetry as ambergris clouds without water and konx om pax as well as his first attempt at an autobiography the worlds tragedy recognising the popularity of short horror stories crowley wrote his own some of which were published and he also published several articles in  a magazine edited by his friend  he also wrote  a book of magical and   that borrowed from mathers and bennett
in november 1907 crowley and jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the hermetic order of the golden dawn being aided in doing so by fuller the result was the  the groups headquarters and temple were situated at 124 victoria street in central london and their rites borrowed much from those of the golden dawn but with an added thelemic basis its earliest members included solicitor richard noel warren artist  horace sheridan bickers author george raffalovich francis henry everard joseph feilding engineer herbert edward inman kenneth ward and  in march 1909 crowley began production of a biannual periodical titled  he billed this periodical which was to become the official organ of the a∴a∴ as the review of scientific illuminism
crowley had become increasingly frustrated with roses alcoholism and in november 1909 he divorced her on the grounds of his own adultery lola was entrusted to roses care the couple remained friends and rose continued to live at boleskine her alcoholism worsened and as a result she was institutionalised in september 1911
in november 1909 crowley and neuburg travelled to algeria touring the desert from  to   and then  with crowley reciting the  on a daily basis during the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of  with neuburg recording the results later published in the equinox as the vision and the voice following a mountaintop  ritual crowley also performed an invocation to the demon  involving  considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career returning to london in january 1910 crowley found that mathers was suing him for publishing golden dawn secrets in the equinox the court found in favour of crowley the case was widely reported on in the press with crowley gaining wider fame crowley enjoyed this and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a satanist and advocate of human sacrifice despite being neither
the publicity attracted new members to the a∴a∴ among them frank bennett james bayley herbert close and james windram the australian violinist  soon became crowleys lover deciding to expand his teachings to a wider audience crowley developed the rites of artemis a public performance of magic and symbolism featuring a∴a∴ members personifying various deities it was first performed at the a∴a∴ headquarters with attendees given a fruit punch containing  to enhance their experience various members of the press attended and reported largely positively on it in october and november 1910 crowley decided to stage something similar the  at   this time press reviews were mixed crowley came under particular criticism from west de wend fenton editor of  newspaper who called him one of the most blasphemous and cold blooded villains of modern timesi fentons articles suggested that crowley and jones were involved in homosexual activity crowley did not mind but jones unsuccessfully sued for libel fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with crowley over the scandal and crowley and neuburg returned to algeria for further magical workings

new followers continued to arrive at the abbey to be taught by crowley among them was film star  who arrived in july 1920 where she was initiated into the a∴a∴ and became crowleys secretary another was cecil frederick russell who often argued with crowley disliking the same sex sexual magic that he was required to perform and left after a year more conducive was the australian thelemite frank bennett who also spent several months at the abbey in february 1922 crowley returned to paris for a retreat in an unsuccessful attempt to kick his heroin addiction he then went to london in search of money where he published articles in  criticising the  and wrote a novel  completed in july on publication it received mixed reviews he was lambasted by the  which called for its burning and used its influence to prevent further reprints
subsequently a young thelemite named raoul loveday moved to the abbey with his wife betty may while loveday was devoted to crowley may detested him and life at the commune she later claimed that loveday was made to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat and that they were required to cut themselves with razors every time they used the pronoun i raoul drank from a local polluted stream soon developing a liver infection resulting in his death in february 1923 returning to london may told her story to the press john bull proclaimed crowley the wickedest man in the world and a man wed like to hang and although crowley deemed many of their accusations against him to be slanderous he was unable to afford the legal fees to sue them as a result john bull continued its attack with its stories being repeated in newspapers throughout europe and in north america the  government of  learned of crowleys activities and in april 1923 he was given a deportation notice forcing him to leave italy without him the abbey closed

when the  broke out crowley wrote to the  offering his services but they declined he associated with a variety of figures in britains intelligence community at the time including    and  and claimed to have been behind the  sign first used by the  this has never been proven
in 1940 his asthma worsened and with his german produced medication unavailable he returned to using heroin once again becoming addicted as  hit london crowley relocated to  where he was briefly hospitalised with asthma and entertained himself with visits to the local chess club tiring of torquay he returned to london where he was visited by american thelemite  to whom crowley awarded the title of hymenaeus alpha he stipulated that though germer would be his immediate successor mcmurty should succeed germer as head of the oto after the latters death with oto initiate  crowley developed plans to produce a  set designed by him and painted by harris accompanying this was a book published in a limited edition as  by  in 1944 to aid the war effort he wrote a proclamation on the rights of humanity liber oz and a poem for the liberation of france le gauloise crowleys final publication during his lifetime was a book of poetry olla an anthology of sixty years of song another of his projects aleister explains everything was posthumously published as

crowleys thought was not always cohesive and was influenced by a variety of sources ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like hindu yoga and buddhism  and various currents within western esotericism among them ceremonial magic alchemy astrology rosicrucianism kabbalah and the tarot philosopher john moore opined that crowleys thought was rooted in  and the  an assessment shared by historian alex owen who noted that crowley adhered to the modus operandi of the decadent movement throughout his life
crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanitys entry to the aeon of horus a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny he believed that this aeon follows on from the aeon of osiris in which paternalistic religions like christianity islam and buddhism dominated the world and that this in turn had followed the aeon of isis which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own true will that they should discover and pursue and that this exists in harmony with the cosmic will that pervades the universe the moral code of do what thou wilt is believed by thelemites to be the faiths ethical law although academic marco pasi noted that this was not  or  in structure as crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism
crowley believed in the objective existence of  which he chose to spell magick in his book magick in theory and practice crowley defined magick as the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will he also told his disciple karl germer that magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level crowley saw magick as a third way between religion and science giving the equinox the subtitle of the method of science the aim of religion
both during his life and after it crowley has been widely described as a  usually by detractors crowley stated he did not consider himself a satanist nor did he worship  as he did not accept the christian world view in which satan was believed to exist he was also accused of advocating  largely because of a passage in book 4 in which he stated that a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim this was intended as a veiled erence to male 
crowley biographer  asserted that crowley was self confident brash eccentric egotistic highly intelligent arrogant witty wealthy and when it suited him cruel similarly richard spence noted that crowley was capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty biographer  noted that crowley exhibited courage skill dauntless energy and remarkable focus of will while at the same time showing a blind arrogance petty fits of bile and contempt for the abilities of his fellow men the thelemite  noted that crowley was by no means perfect and often alienated those who loved him dearest
crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality with  noting that he was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time crowleys political thought was subjected to an in depth study by academic marco pasi who noted that for crowley socio political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones pasi argued that it was difficult to classify crowley as being either on the political  or  but he was perhaps best categorised as a conservative revolutionary despite not being affiliated with the german based  pasi noted that crowley sympathised with extreme ideologies like  and  in that they wished to violently overturn society and hoped that both nazi germany and the soviet union might adopt thelema crowley described democracy as an imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness and commented that the book of the law proclaimed that there is the master and there is the slave the noble and the serf the lone wolf and the herd in this attitude he was influenced by the work of  and by  crowley also saw himself as an aristocrat describing himself as laird boleskine he had contempt for most of the british aristocracy and once described his ideology as aristocratic communism
crowley was bisexual and exhibited a sexual perence for women in particular he had an attraction toward exotic women and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions kaczynski stated that when he loved he did so with his whole being but the passion was typically short lived even in later life he was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers largely due to his charisma during same sex  he usually played the passive role which booth believed appealed to his masochistic side crowley argued that gay and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation commenting that a person must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion or medieval morality or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise on other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude he opposed abortion on moral grounds believing that no woman following her true will would ever desire one
biographer lawrence sutin stated that blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in crowleys writings sutin thought crowley a spoiled scion of a wealthy victorian family who embodied many of the worst  racial and social prejudices of his upper class contemporaries noting that he embodied the contradiction that writhed within many western intellectuals of the time deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of their culture coupled with a fascination with people of colour crowley insulted his close jewish friend victor neuburg using  slurs and he had mixed opinions about jews as a group although he praised their sublime poetry and claimed that the jewish race contained imagination romance loyalty probity and humanity in an exceptional degree he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some jews to exhibit avarice servility falseness cunning and the rest he was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups for instance he claimed that the chinese people exhibited a spiritual superiority to the english and praised muslims for exhibiting manliness straightforwardness subtlety and self respect
crowley also exhibited a general misogyny that booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother sutin noted that crowley largely accepted the notion implicitly embodied in victorian sexology of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility crowley described women as moral inferiors who had to be treated with firmness kindness and justice
crowley has remained an influential figure both amongst occultists and in popular culture particularly that of britain but also of other parts of the world in 2002 a bbc poll placed crowley seventy third in a list of the    has written of him that in native talent penetrating intelligence and determination aleister crowley was the best equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century    asserted that crowley was an extreme representation of the dark side of the occult while philosopher john moore opined that crowley stood out as a modern master when compared with other prominent occult figures like    or  also describing him as a living embodiment of s 
biographer  considered crowley a pioneer of consciousness research and sutin thought that he had made distinctly original contributions to the study of yoga in the west
thelema continued to develop and spread following crowleys death in 1969 the oto was reactivated in california under the leadership of grady louis mcmurtry in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group the society ordo templi orientis led by brazilian thelemite 
another american thelemite was the filmmaker  who had been influenced by crowleys writings from a young age  in the united kingdom  propagated a tradition known as typhonian thelema through his organisation the typhonian oto later renamed the 
also in britain an occultist known as  claimed to be crowleys son these claims have been uted by academic investigation amado argued that thelema was a false religion created by crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings which amado claimed to be propagating
several western esoteric traditions other than thelema were also influenced by crowley gerald gardner founder of  made use of much of crowleys published material when composing the gardnerian ritual liturgy and the australian witch  was also heavily influenced by crowleys ideas  the american founder of  was involved in thelema in the early 1940s with  and it has been argued that  two prominent figures in religious satanism  and michael aquino were also influenced by crowleys work
crowley also had a wider influence in british popular culture he was included as one of the figures on the cover art of  album  1967 and his motto of do what thou wilt was inscribed on the vinyl of s album  1970 led zeppelin co founder  bought boleskine in 1971 and part of the bands film  was filmed in the grounds he sold it in 1992   made erence to crowley in the lyrics of his song  1971 while  and his lyricist  wrote a song titled  1980    please do not add any further instances of crowleyan influence on popular culture unless you have third hand academic references to bolster such statements with as has been discussed at the talk page this section is not a deposit for any and all trivia regarding crowleys substantial legacy across western culture least of all those which are insufficiently referenced if in doubt open a discussion on the talk page to see if you can gain support for adding information

the soul called  leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or karma performed by one in last birth rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth in between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in  or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in svarga or heaven for good deeds whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth also known as mrutyulok or human world a person stays with the god or ultimate power when he discharges only amp only yajna karma means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only in last birth and the same is called as moksha or nirvana which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul atma  moves with parmatma or the greatest soul according to bhagavad gita an atma or soul never dies what dies is the body only made of five elements—earth water fire air and sky soul is believed to be indestructible none of the five elements can harm or influence it hinduism through garuda purana also describes in detail various types of narkas or hells where a person after death is punished for his bad karmas and dealt with accordingly
hindus also believe in karma karma is the accumulated sums of ones good or bad deeds satkarma means good deeds vikarma means bad deeds according to  the basic concept of karma is as you sow you shall reap so if a person has lived a good life they will be rewarded in the afterlife similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results there is no judgment here people accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts in bhagavad gita when arjuna hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus do you believe that you are the doer of the action no you are merely an instrument in my hands do you believe that the people in front of you are living dear arjuna they are already dead as a kshatriya warrior it is your duty to protect your people and land if you fail to do your duty then you are not adhering to dharmic principles
buddhists maintain that  takes place without an unchanging  or soul passing from one form to another  the type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the persons actions kamma or  for example if a person has committed harmful actions of body speech and mind based on greed hatred and delusion rebirth in a lower realm ie an animal a  or a hell realm is to be expected on the other hand where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity loving kindness  compassion and wisdom rebirth in a happy realm ie human or one of the many heavenly realms can be expected
yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic it depends on various levels of kamma the most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment at that moment heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed if not then near death kamma if not then habitual kamma finally if none of the above happened then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen according to theravada buddhism there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into
pure land buddhism of mahayana believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called pure land it is believed that each buddha has their own pure land created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a buddha there thus the main practice of pure land buddhism is to chant a buddhas name
in  the  explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation the deceased will find the bright light of wisdom which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation there are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals and some have fear which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness in the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible so it is important to be virtuous adopt a positive attitude and avoid negative ideas ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions in this situation they have to understand that these manifestations are just lections of the inner thoughts no one can really hurt them because they have no more material body the deceased get help from different s who show them the path to the bright light the ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation they have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before it is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the  and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings

 has a very strong belief in after life they believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in god however its been a matter of great debate amongst the sikhs about sikhisms belief in afterlife many believe that sikhism endorses afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in guru granth sahib but a large number of sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic
but if one analyse the sikh scriptures caully one may find that on many occasions afterlife existence of heaven and hell are mentioned succinctly in guru granth sahib and in dasam granth so from that it can been concluded that sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell however heaven and hell are created to reward and punish one will then take birth again until one merges in god  according to the sikh scriptures the human form is the closet form to god and the best opportunity for a human being attain salvation and merge back with god sikh gurus said that nothing dies nothing is born everything is ever present and it just changes forms that is a higher philosophy it’s like standing in front of a wardrobe you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it you wear another one you’re just changing one form into another one actually your soul is never born and never dies your soul is a part of god and hence lives foreverhttp  wwwrealsikhismcom indexphpsubaction showfullampid 1248308791ampucat 7

according to cayce this afterlife realm can be erred to as the realm of love sympathy the alleviating of hardships the seeking of love beauty and song are some influences that people from that realm possess beauty either natural or man made will move these individuals furthermore there is a desire to beautify the home there is a strong attraction to the opposite sex this dimension is an indescribably lovely existence here one must leave behind all rigid intellectual structures and dogmas be they scientific religious or philosophical an infinite variety of new sounds colors and feelings are experienced here and souls find a much wider freedom to function with highly energized intellect and spirit if in this dimension the soul becomes free from the earth pull it is qualified to experience cosmic ranges beyond earths confines

astrometry is the branch of  that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of s and other  the information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the  and physical origin of the  and our  the 
the history of astrometry is linked to the history of s which gave astronomers erence points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements this can be dated back to  who around 190 bc used the catalogue of his predecessors  and  to discover earths  in doing so he also developed the brightness scale still in use todaywalter hans g 2000  hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions  hipparchuss successor  included a catalogue of 1022 stars in his work the  giving their location coordinates and brightnessp 110 kanas 2007

in 1989 the s  satellite took astrometry into orbit where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere operated from 1989 to 1993 hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes during its 4 year run the positions parallaxes and  of 118218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy a new  drew together a database of 1058332 to within 20 30  milliarcseconds additional catalogues were compiled for the 23882 double multiple stars and 11597 s also analyzed during the hipparcos mission 
today the catalogue most often used is  an all sky catalogue that tracks proper motions positions magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects during the past 50 years 7435  plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in usno b10 accurate to within 02 arcseckovalevsky jean 1995

astrometry has also been used to support claims of  by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent stars apparent position on the sky due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system although as of 2009 none of the extrasolar planets detected by ground based astrometry has been verified in subsequent studies astrometry is expected to be more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the earths atmospherenature  462 705 2009 8 december 2009   nasas planned   now cancelled was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect s orbiting 200 or so of the nearest  and the european space agencys  launched in 2013 which will be applying astrometric techniques in its stellar censushttp  wwwesaint esasc 120377_index_0_mhtml esa   space science   gaia overview

astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of  astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record breaking solar system objects to find such objects astrometrically astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals by studying these images they can detect solar system objects by their movements relative to the background stars which remain fixed once a movement per unit time is observed astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by earth’s motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated using this distance and other photographs more information about the object including its  can be obtained 
 and  are two solar system objects discovered in this way by  and others at caltech using the s  of  and the palomar quest large area ccd camera the ability of astronomers to track the positions and movements of such celestial bodies is crucial to the understanding of the solar system and its interrelated past present and future with others in the universe  
a fundamental aspect of astrometry is error correction various factors introduce errors into the measurement of stellar positions including atmospheric conditions imperfections in the instruments and errors by the observer or the measuring instruments many of these errors can be reduced by various techniques such as through instrument improvements and compensations to the data the results are then  using  to compute data estimates and error ranges

athena is portrayed as a shrewd companion of es and is the patron  of heroic endeavour she is the  patroness of  the athenians founded the  on the  of her namesake city athens athena parthenos in her honour name deacy susan 2001 
veneration of athena was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes in her role as a protector of the city  many people throughout the greek world worshipped athena as athena polias Ἀθηνᾶ Πολιάς athena of the city while the city of athens and the goddess athena essentially bear the same name athena the goddess athenai the city it is not known which of the two words is derived from the otherwhether the goddess was named after the city or the city after the goddess is an ancient dispute burkert 1985139 
athena is associated with  a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood the athenai in earliest times  was the city where the goddess was called mykene and mycenae is named in the plural for the sisterhood of females who tended her there at  she was called thebe and the city again a plural thebae or thebes where the ‘s’ is the plural formation similarly at athens she was called athena and the city athenae or athens again a pluralruck and staples 199424 
athena had a special relationship with  as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city according to mythical lore she competed with poseidon and she won by creating the olive tree the athenians would accept her gift and name the city after her in history the citizens of athens built a statue of athena as a temple to the goddess which had piercing eyes a helmet on her head attired with an  or  and an extremely long spear it also had a crystal shield with the head of the gorgon on it a large snake accompanied her and she held  the goddess of victory in her hand

in his dialogue  the greek philosopher  428–347 bc gives the etymology of athena’s name based on the views of the ancient athenians and his own etymological speculations

   her role as the virgin mother of  was a relic of an archaic myth of the patron goddess of athenai that preceded her placement among the olympian pantheon

with this mythic origin erichthonius became the founder  and many beneficial changes to athenian culture were ascribed to him during this time athena frequently protected him
 
in a late myth  unlike her sister s came to be viewed by the greeks of the 5th century as a beautiful mortal that served as priestess in athenas temple poseidon liked medusa and decided to rape her in the temple of athena using to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way  upon discovering the desecration of her temple athena changed medusas form to match that of her sister gorgons as punishment medusas hair turned into snakes her lower body was transformed also and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone in the earliest myths there is only one  but there are two snakes that form a belt around her waist
in one version of the  myth tiresias stumbled upon athena bathing and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see but having lost his eyesight he was given a special gift—to be able to understand the language of the birds and thus to foretell the future
athena competed with  to be the patron deity of athens which was yet unnamed in a version of one  they agreed that each would give the athenians one gift and that the athenians would choose the gift they perred poseidon struck the ground with his  and a salt water spring sprang up this gave them a means of trade and water—athens at its height was a significant sea power defeating the  fleet at the —but the water was salty and not very good for drinking name graves 1960163p 62graves 1960163p 62 
athena however offered them the first domesticated  the athenians or their king  accepted the olive tree and with it the patronage of athena for the olive tree brought wood oil and food  was of the opinion that poseidons attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths which lect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions name graves 1960163p 62 
 
athena also was the patron goddess of several other greek cities notably sparta where the archaic cult of  had its sanctuaries in the surrounding villages of  and notably   in sparta itself the temple of athena khalkíoikos athena of the brazen house often ized as chalcioecus was the grandest and located on the spartan acropolis presumably it had a roof of bronze the forecourt of the brazen house was the place where the most solemn religious functions in sparta took place

  another interesting and arguable reason for why the athenians chose athenas olive tree over poseidons horses and spring was because poseidon was known to be a very difficult deity to please and often wrought havoc even upon his cities athena was a better choice because of her less violent personality and the athenians did not wish to have to encounter poseidons wrath in future poseidon and athena may also be viewed as foils for one another athena girding order and civility in approaching conflicts and poseidon unleashing rage without moderation poseidon lords over the horses and lets them run rampant while athena produces the bridle and chariot so that the horse may be tamedmdetienneathena and the mastery of the horse history of religions161 184hassocksharvester press1991  civilization needed the tranquility and resourcefulness of athena much more than an uninhibited temper

in   cunning and shrewd nature quickly won athenas favour in the realistic epic mode however she largely is confined to aiding him only from afar as by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from troy her guiding actions reinforce her role as the protectress of heroes or as mythologian  dubbed her the goddess of nearness due to her mentoring and motherly probingwfottodie gotter griechenlands55 77bonnfcohen1929  it is not until he washes up on the shore of an island where  is washing her clothes that athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance she appears in nausicaas dreams to ensure that the princess rescues odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to ithaca
athena appears in disguise to odysseus upon his arrival initially lying and telling him that penelope his wife has remarried and that he is believed to be dead but odysseus lies back to her employing skillful prevarications to protect himselftrahman in phoenix p 35  impressed by his resolve and shrewdness she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom she disguises him as an elderly man or beggar so that he cannot be noticed by the suitors or penelope and helps him to defeat the suitors
she also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors relatives she instructs laertes to throw his spear and to kill the father of antinous eupeithes
in one myth all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of  and  the eventual parents of  only  goddess of discord was not invited she was annoyed at this so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ kallistēi for the fairest which she threw among the goddesses aphrodite hera and athena all claimed to be the fairest and thus the rightful owner of the apple
the goddesses chose to place the matter before zeus who not wanting to favor one of the goddesses put the choice into the hands of paris a  prince after bathing in the spring of  where troy was situated the goddesses appeared before paris for his decision the goddesses undressed before him to be evaluated either at his request or by their own choice
still paris could not decide as all three were ideally beautiful so they resorted to bribes hera tried to bribe paris with control over all  and  while athena offered wisdom fame and glory in battle but aphrodite came forth and whispered to paris that if he were to choose her as the fairest he would have the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife and he accordingly chose her this woman was  who was unfortunately for paris already married to king  of  the other two goddesses were enraged by this and through helens abduction by paris they brought about the 
another interpretation is that the apple was being given to the man by the three goddesses instead of to one of the goddesses this is the interpretation mythologists and writers delving into more ancient greek myths that date from before the classical period the later interpretation is considered a variant interpretation of icons of great antiquity to conform to the changes in the evolution of the greek pantheon in myths
it is suspected that the icons relate to a religious ritual in which a king was selected who would serve for a year or a specified period before being sacrificed and that the cycle would be renewed upon his death  was a strong proponent of this theory and it is written about in many of his publications such as  and  this also was suggested in the early versions of an extensive analysis of greek mythology  by  in a later editions frazer completely revised the book and left out his research and discussion of these rituals in the abbreviated edition that is known by that title today
these interpretations relate to a concept of a great goddess a  and the religious worship of such a deity in very ancient greek culture it took a triad form one phase being athena along with hera and aphrodite and others in her matrilineal line grandmother mother etc such as     and myths that arose through interpretations or misinterpretations of icons from earlier cultural periods the apple would have been given to the king the three goddesses selected
the  of  is a late roman addition to classical the arachne narrative is in s  vi5 54 and 129 145 and mentioned in s  iv 246  but does not appear in the myth repertoire of the attic vase painters arachnes name means spider   arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in  in hypaipa of  and a weaving student of athena she became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of athena herself
athena gave arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning arachne not to offend the deities arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest so she could prove her skill
athena wove the scene of her victory over  that had inspired her patronage of athens according to ovids latin narrative arachnes tapestry featured twenty one episodes of the infidelity of the deities including  being unfaithful with  with  and with  athena admitted that arachnes work was flawless but was outraged at arachnes offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities finally losing her temper athena destroyed arachnes tapestry and loom striking it with her shuttle
athena then struck arachne with her staff which changed her into a spider in some versions the destruction of her loom leads arachne to hang herself in despair athena takes pity on her and transforms her into a spider in the aforementioned version arachne weaved scenes of joy while athena weaved scenes of horror
the fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in   no citation required this is merely the superficial reading  
in  mythology the role of athena changed as the pantheon became organized under the leadership of zeus in earlier mythology she is identified as a  daughter of a goddess but the classical myths fashion for her a peculiar birth from the head of zeus that assigns a father for athena and eliminates a mother for her identifying the father as a deity who at one time was portrayed as her brother athens may have fallen in 404 bc but the cult of athena was so dominant in the culture that it survived the transitions seen in the mythic roles of other goddesses albeit with a juggling of family relationships
jj bachofen advocated that athena was originally a maternal figure stable in her security and poise but was caught up and perverted by a patriarchal society this was especially the case in athens the goddess adapted but could very easily be seen as a god he viewed it as motherless paternity in the place of fatherless maternity where once altered athenas character was to be crystallized as that of a patriarchjj bachofenmother rightan investigation of religious and juridical character of matriarchy in the ancient worldmyth religion and mother rightlondonroutledge and kegan paul1967 
whereas bachofen saw the switch to paternity on athenas behalf as an increase of power freud on the contrary perceived athena as an original mother goddess divested of her power in this interpretation athena was demoted to be only zeuss daughter never allowed the expression of motherhood still more different from bachofens perspective is the lack of role permanency in freuds view freud held that time and differing cultures would mold athena to stand for what was necessary to themshearerathene224 235 
some modern authors classify the changes as an androgynous compromise that allowed her traits and what she stood for to be attributed to male and female rulers alike over the course of history such as    and fzeitlinthe dynamics of misogynymyth and mythmaking in the oresteiaarethusa151978 182 
classically athena is portrayed wearing a full length  and sometimes in armor with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of  her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon gorgoneion in the center and snakes around the edge it is in this standing posture that she was depicted in s famous lost  statue of her 36 m tall the  in the  athena also often is depicted with an  sitting on one of her shouldersthe owls role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with athena 
the  is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 bc and portrays a weary athena resting on a staff  better interpretation  
in earlier archaic portraits of athena in  the goddess retains some of her minoan mycenaean character such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of  where athena has subsumed an earlier invisibly numinous——goddess with cretan connections in her mythos
other commonly received and repeated types of athena in sculpture may be found in 
apart from her attributes there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the classical period the 5th century onward as to what athena looked like most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead the eyes typically are somewhat deeply set the unsmiling lips are usually full but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow usually just slightly wider than the nose the neck is somewhat long the net result is a serene serious somewhat aloof and very classical beauty
 
a brief summary of athenas evolution of myriad motifs after her dominance in greece may be seen as follows the rise of christianity in greece largely ended the worship of greek deities and polytheism in general but she resurfaced in the middle ages as a defender of sagacity and virtue so that her warrior status was still intact she may be found on some family crests of nobility during the renaissance she donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor and finally although not ultimately athena personified the miracles of freedom and republic during the french revolution a statue of the goddess was centered on the place de la revolution in paris name deacy susan 2001

the amber diceless roleplaying game is a  created and written by  set in the  created by author  for his  the game is unusual in that no  are used in resolving conflicts or player actions instead a simple  system of comparative ability and narrative description of the action by the players and  is used to determine how situations are resolved name pyr  name hg 
amber drpg was created in the 1980s and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era name pyr   most amber characters are members of the two ruling classes in the amber  and are much more advanced in matters of strength endurance psyche warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings this often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue
the original 256 page game book name amberdrpgerick wujcik amber diceless roleplaying game  1991 isbn 1 880494 00 0  was published in 1991 by  covering material from the first five novels the  and some details – sorcery and the  – from the remaining five novels the  in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the courts of chaos some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice – for example players can be full trump artists without having walked the pattern or the logrus which  says is impossible and players  abilities are far greater than those shown in the books
a 256 page companion volume shadow knight name shadowknighterick wujcik shadow knight phage press 1993 isbn 1 880494 01 9  was published in 1993 this supplemental  includes the remaining elements from the merlin novels such as broken patterns and allows players to create constructs such as merlins ghostwheel the book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series  but as an example of a  with merlin luke julia jurt and coral as the pcs the remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series and perhaps most usefully for gms plot summaries of each of the ten books the book includes some material from the short story  and some unpublished material cut from  notably corals pregnancy by merlin
both books were translated into french and published by  in 1994 and 1995
a third book rebma was promised cover art was commissionedstephen hickmans http  wwwtherpgsitecom showthreadphpt 14836 rebma cover art  and pre orders were taken but it never arrived wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the courts of chaos name pyramid  the publishing rights to the amber drpg games were acquired in 2004 by  who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game however no new edition was released before guardians of order went out of business in 2006 the two existing books are now  but they have been made available as  downloads name pdfhttp  rpgdrivethrustuffcom catalog indexphpcpath 28_156 amber drpg books at drivethrurpg 
in june 2007 a new publishing company headed by edwin voskamp and eric todd was formed with the express purpose of bringing amber drpg back into print the new company is named diceless by design name dicelessbydesignhttp  wwwdicelessbydesigncom diceless by design   
in may 2010 rite publishing secured a license from diceless by design to use the rules system with a new setting in the creation of a new product to be written by industry and system veteran jason durall  the project lords of gossamer amp shadow diceless was funded via  in may 2013  in sept 2013 the project was completed and on in nov 2013 lords of gossamer and shadow diceless   was released publicly in full color print and pdf along with additional supplements and continued support
the game is set in the  described in zelaznys chronicles of amber the first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the patternfall war that is after the end of the fifth book in the series  but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of zelaznys cosmology that were featured there in more detail the amber multiverse consists of amber a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found  the symbol of  the courts of chaos an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found  the manifestation of  and the abyss the source or end of all reality and shadow the collection of all possible s shadows between and around them inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the pattern and the logrus to travel through shadow
it is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books – the ruling family of amber known as the elder amberites – or a resident of the courts however since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting it is fairly common to either start with king oberons death before the book begins and roleplay the elder amberites as they vie for the throne or to populate amber from scratch with a different set of elder amberites the former option is one presented in the book the latter is known in the amber community as an  game a third option is to have the players portray s children in an amber like city built around corwins pattern this is sometimes called an  game since one of corwins  colours is 
characters in amber drpg are represented by four  psyche strength endurance and warfare
psyche is used for feats of willpower or magic
strength is used for feats of strength or 
endurance is used for feats of endurance
warfare is used for armed combat from duelling to commanding armies
the attributes run from −25 normal human level through −10 normal level for a denizen of the courts of chaos and 0 normal level for an inhabitant of amber upwards without limit scores above 0 are ranked with the highest score being ranked 1st the next highest 2nd and so on the character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered superior in that attribute being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small  all else being equal a character with a higher rank in an attribute will always win a contest based on that attribute
 
a characters ability scores are purchased during  in an  players get 100 s and bid on each attribute in turn the character who bids the most for an attribute is ranked first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute unlike conventional auctions bids are non undable if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66 then the character with 66 is superior to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference instead lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it after the auction players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank further a character with a bid for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought up rank
the auction simulates a history of competition between the descendants of oberon for s who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other through the competitive auction characters may begin the game vying for standings the auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice cards or other randomizing devices a player may intend for example to create a character who is a strong mighty warrior but being outplayed in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated theore necessitating a change of character concept since a player cannot control another players bids and since all bids are non undable the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players a willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects in a hotly contested auction such as for the important attribute of warfare the most valuable skill is the ability to force ones opponents to back down with two or more equally determined players this can result in a bidding war where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums an alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses a high enough opening bid could signal a players determination to be first ranked in that attribute thereby dissuading others from competing
 
characters with high psyche are presented as having strong  abilities being able to  and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye contact this is likely due to three scenes in the chronicles first when eric paralyzes corwin with an attack across the trump and uses to desist because one or the other would be dominated second when  faces the demon strygalldwir it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet and third when fiona is able to keep brand immobile in the final battle at the courts of chaos name greatbookofamberroger zelazny the great book of amber  1999 isbn 0 380 80906 0  however in general the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind to mind contact for example trump contact and magic or trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts so it is not clear whether zelazny intended his characters to have such a power the combination of brands living trump powers and his high psyche as presented in the roleplaying game would have guaranteed him victory over corwin shadow knight does address this inconsistency somewhat by presenting the living trump abilities as somewhat limited
characters in amber drpg have access to the powers seen in the chronicles of amber pattern logrus shape shifting trump and magic
pattern a character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe and while there can manipulate probability
logrus a character who has mastered the logrus can send out logrus tendrils and pull themselves or objects through shadow
shape shifting shape shifters can alter their physical form and abilities
trump trump artists can create trumps a sort of  card which allows mental communication and travel the book features trump portraits of each of the elder amberites the trump picture of corwin is executed in a subtly different style – and has features very similar to roger zelaznys
magic three types of magic are detailed power words with a quick small effect sorcery with pre prepared spells as in many other game systems and conjuration the creation of small objects
each of the first four powers is available in an advanced form
while a character with pattern logrus or conjuration can acquire virtually any object players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues – unbreakability or a mind of their own since they have paid points for the items they are a part of the characters legend and cannot lightly be destroyed similarly a character can find any possible universe but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are in some sense real and theore useful the expansion shadow knight adds constructs – artifacts with connections to shadows
unspent character points become good stuff – a good luck for the character players are also allowed to overspend in moderation with the points becoming bad stuff – bad luck which the gamemaster should inflict on the character stuff governs how non player characters perceive and respond to the character characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility
as well as representing luck stuff can be seen as representing a characters  characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile
in any given fair conflict between two characters the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win the key words here are fair and eventually – if characters ranks are close and the weaker character has obtained some advantage then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution alternatively if characters attribute ranks are close the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict for example if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is strength a character could reveal a weapon changing it to warfare they could try to overcome the other characters mind using a power changing it to psyche or they could concentrate their strength on defense changing it to endurance if there is a substantial difference between characters ranks the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react
amber drpg advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit – even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes
despite the games  status a thriving  scene exists supporting the game amber conventions known as ambercons are held yearly in      england and  additionally phage press published 12 volumes of a dedicated amber drpg magazine called amberzine some amberzine issues are still available from phage press

an alloy is a mixture of s or a mixture of a metal and another  alloys are defined by metallic bonding charactercallister w d materials science and engineering an introduction 2007 7th edition john wiley and sons inc new york section 43 and chapter 9  an alloy may be a  of metal elements a single phase or a mixture of metallic phases two or more solutions  compounds are alloys with a defined  and crystal structure s are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types see also  for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds
alloys are used in a wide variety of applications in some cases a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties in other cases the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength examples of alloys are       and s
the alloy constituents are usually measured by mass alloys are usually classified as substitutional or s depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy they can be further classified as homogeneous consisting of a single phase or heterogeneous consisting of two or more phases or 
an alloy is a mixture of either pure or fairly pure  which forms an impure substance admixture that retains the characteristics of a  an alloy is distinct from an impure metal such as  in that with an alloy the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit alloys are made by mixing two or more elements at least one of which being a metal this is usually called the primary metal or the base metal and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy the other constituents may or may not be metals but when mixed with the molten base they will be  dissolving into the mixture
when the alloy cools and solidifies s its mechanical properties will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents a metal that is normally very soft and  such as  can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal like  although both metals are very soft and  the resulting  will be much  and  adding a small amount of non metallic  to  produces an alloy called  due to its very high strength and  which is much higher than pure iron and its ability to be greatly altered by  steel is one of the most common alloys in modern use by adding  to steel its resistance to  can be enhanced creating  while adding  will alter its electrical characteristics producing 
although the elements usually must be soluble in the  state they may not always be soluble in the  state if the metals remain soluble when solid the alloy forms a  becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals called a  if the mixture cools and the constituents become insoluble they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals creating a heterogeneous  of different phases however in other alloys the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs these alloys are called intermetallic alloys because if cooled very quickly they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase but they are  with the secondary constituents as time passes the atoms of these supersaturated alloys separate within the crystals forming intermetallic phases that serve to reinforce the crystals internally
some alloys occur naturally such as  which is an alloy that is  to earth consisting of  and  meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and  but are not native to the earth one of the first alloys made by humans was  which is made by mixing the metals  and  bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components steel was another common alloy however in ancient times it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires  during the manufacture of iron other ancient alloys include   and  in the modern age steel can be created in many forms  can be made by varying only the carbon content producing soft alloys like  or hard alloys like  s can be made by adding other elements such as   or nickel resulting in alloys such as  or  small amounts of  are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities like   and  which can have detrimental effects on the alloy however most alloys were not created until the 1900s such as various aluminium   and s some modern s such as   and  may consist of a multitude of different components
the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal the primary metal is called the base the matrix or the  the secondary constituents are often called solutes if there is a mixture of only two types of atoms not counting impurities such as a  alloy then it is called a binary alloy if there are three types of atoms forming the mixture such as iron nickel and chromium then it is called a ternary alloy an alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy while a five part alloy is termed a quinary alloy because the percentage of each constituent can be varied with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system in this respect all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents like iron and carbon is called a binary system while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy such as alloys of iron carbon and chromium is called a ternary systembauccio michael 1003 asm metals erence book asm international isbn 0 87170 478 1 
although an alloy is technically an impure metal when erring to alloys the term impurities usually denotes those elements which are not desired these impurities are often found in the base metals or the solutes but they may also be introduced during the alloying process for instance sulfur is a common impurity in steel sulfur combines readily with iron to form  which is very brittle creating weak spots in the steel    and  are common impurities in aluminium alloys which can have adverse effects on the  of castings conversely otherwise pure metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called impure metals and are not usually erred to as alloys oxygen present in the air readily combines with most metals to form s especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities using  chemical additives or other methods of davis joseph r 1993 asm specialty handbook aluminum and aluminum alloys asm international p 211 isbn 978 0 87170 496 2 
in practice some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy for example 14   is an alloy of gold with other elements similarly the  used in  and the  used as a structural building material are also alloys
the term alloy is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy for example automobile wheels made of an  are commonly erred to as simply s although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys steel is such a common alloy that many items made from it like s s or s are simply erred to by the name of the item assuming it is made of steel when made from other materials they are typically specified as such ie bronze wheel plastic barrel or wood girder
alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non metals that often enhance its properties for example  is stronger than  its primary element the  and  of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals the physical properties such as    of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements but engineering properties such as mills adelbert phillo 1922 materials of construction their manufacture and properties john wiley amp sons inc originally published by the university of wisconsin madison  and  may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials this is sometimes a result of the sizes of the s in the alloy because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors helping the alloy resist deformation sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present for example impurities in semiconducting  alloys lead to different properties as first predicted by white hogan suhl tian abrie and nakamura  
some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals  an alloy of  and  was the first alloy discovered during the  period now known as the  it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties in later times bronze has been used for  s s and   is an alloy made from  and 
unlike pure metals most alloys do not have a single  but a melting range in which the material is a mixture of  and  phases the temperature at which melting begins is called the  and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the  however for many alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents in some cases more than one—either a  mixture or a —which gives the alloy a unique melting point
alloys are often made to alter the mechanical properties of the base metal to induce    or other desired properties most metals and alloys can be  by creating defects in their crystal structure these defects are created during  such as hammering or bending and are permanent unless the metal is  however some alloys can also have their properties altered by  nearly all metals can be softened by  which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling many alloys of     and  can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment but few respond to this to the same degree that  does name jon l dossett page 1 14 
at a certain temperature usually between  and  depending on carbon content the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix called  this allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal  into the iron matrix when this happens the carbon atoms are said to be in  or mixed with the iron forming a single homogeneous crystalline phase called  if the steel is cooled slowly the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope when this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be  with the iron and will be forced to  out of solution  into the spaces between the crystals the steel then becomes heterogeneous being formed of two phases the carbon  phase  and  this type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable however if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate when rapidly cooled a  occurs in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution this causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state making it very hard and brittle
conversely most heat treatable alloys are  alloys which produce the opposite effects that steel does when heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly these alloys become much softer than normal during the diffusionless transformation and then harden as they age the solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time forming  phases which are difficult to discern from the base metal unlike steel in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal these intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure but tend to behave heterogeneous becoming hard and somewhat brittle name jon l dossett page 1 14 
when a molten metal is mixed with another substance there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur when the atoms are relatively similar in size the atom exchange method usually happens where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent this is called a substitutional alloy examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms with the interstitial mechanism one atom is usually much smaller than the other so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix called the interstices this is erred to as an interstitial alloy steel is an example of an interstitial alloy because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix  is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms name jon l dossett page 1 14dossett jon l and boyer howard e 2006 practical heat treating asm international pp 1–14 isbn 1 61503 110 3

while the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 bc mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin the metal is much softer than bronze however very small amounts of  an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon was always a byproduct of the bloomery process the ability to modify the hardness of steel by  had been known since 1100 bc and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of  during the middle ages this method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time but the penetration of carbon was not very deep so the alloy was not homogeneous in 1740  began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content creating the first process for the mass production of  huntsmans process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s name george adam roberts page 2 3roberts george adam krauss george kennedy richard and kennedy richard l 1998 https  booksgooglecom booksid scphevr_ep8camppg pa2 tool steels asm international pp 2–3 isbn 0 87170 599 0

the role of  has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism balance or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful so as times change art changes if changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions the best artists have predated societys changes due not to any prescience but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing
artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see adn execute what lesser artists could not while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions for example paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings but later as leadership became oppressive satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankindcitation needed 
no art owes quite as much to state power as french painting does it was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by louix xiv in the 17th century that the likes of poussin and le brun put france in the foront of european art versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style enduring in later artists like ingres whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where jove is very much in his thronejonathanjonesblog

http  wwwart head startcom 3d squid revolution300jpg here is an example of an artistic revolution pieces
but not all artistic revolutions were political sometimes science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists  the stylistic revolution known as   by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid 19th century in which the style was born
 a french chemist hired as director of dyes at a french tapestry works  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics  chevreul realized it was the eye and not the dye that had the greatest influence on color and from this he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed each imposing its own complementary color on the other  the french painter eugène delacroix who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones  embraced chevreuls book the law of contrast of color 1839 with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum  inspired by chevreul’s 1839 treatise delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him it was chevreul who led the impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them opticallyhttp  wwwbritannicacom biography michel eugene chevreul 
they were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself since the renaissance  painters had to grind pigment add oil and thus create their own paints these time consuming paints also quickly dried out making studio painting a necessity for large works and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out  in 1841 a little known american painter named john g rand invented a simple improvement without which the impressionist movement could not have occurred the small flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be storedhttp  wwwsmithsonianmagcom arts culture never underestimate the power of a paint tube 36637764 no ist may 2013 by perry hurt    oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable    and quite portable for the first time since the renaissance painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried
paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world  to directly observe the play of color and natural light in shadow and movement to paint in the moment  selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments    chrome yellow cadmium blue   invented by 19th century industrial chemists the tubes freed the impressionists to paint quickly and across an entire canvas rather than caully delineated single color sections at a time in short to sketch directly in oil   racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of impressionists   since such speedy bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions not finished paintings which were to have no visible brush marks at all seamless under layers of varnish
pierre auguste renoir said “without colors in tubes there would be no cézanne no monet no pissarro and no impressionism”http  wwwsmithsonianmagcom arts culture never underestimate the power of a paint tube 36637764 #p4ovfkfbrlymihqt99 
finally the caul hyper realistic techniques of french neo classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid 1850s  it was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention particularly by the french inventor daguerre made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the paris diorama with large scale historical paintingsspeculating daguerre art and enterprise in the work of l j m daguerre by stephen c pinson chicago 2012 p 1 12   the neo classical subject matter  limited by academic tradition to greek and roman legends historical battles and biblical stories seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera   daily life candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things paris itself rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light    not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past eventsreview of the lens of impressionism at university of michigan museum of art october  dec 2009 by simon kelly volume 9 issue 1 spring 2010 http  www19thc artworldwideorg spring10 the lens of impressionism  early photographs influenced impressionist style by its use of asymmetry cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography
       in their framing use of color light and shadow subject matter    put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning
their initial break with realism into an exploration of light color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the   who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war  at first thought of as primitive inept works   as in my four year old could do that—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50s  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used or even understood   who pioneered splatter painting dispensing with a paint brush altogether soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in life magazine
in fact in a deliberate secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones  abstract expressionists like pollack robert motherwell willem de kooning and mark rothko while seemingly difficult pathbreaking artists were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the cia in a cold war policy begun in 1947 to prove that the united states could foster more artistic freedom than the soviet blochttp  wwwindependentcouk news world modern art was cia weapon 1578808html   it was recognized that abstract expressionism was the kind of art that made socialist realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was  said former cia case worker donald jameson who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995  ironically the covert cia support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a european tour of these works during the truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative mccarthy era america with truman famously remarking if thats art im a hottentot  thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using cia funds not their own to sponsor traveling exhibitions of american abstract expressionists all over the world publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit abstract expressionist works in major american and british museums thomas braden in charge of these cultural programs for the cia in the early years of the cold war had formerly been executive secretary of the museum of modern art americas leading institution for 20th century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found outhttp  wwwnewyorkercom magazine 2005 10 17 unpopular front

françois boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of french taste in the rococo period trained by his father who was a lace designer boucher won fame with his sensuous and light hearted mythological paintings and landscapes he executed important works for both the queen of france and mme de pompadour louis xvs mistress who was considered the most powerful woman in france at the time boucher was mme de pompadours favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the gobelins tapestry factory the vulcan presenting venus with arms for aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory br

agrarianism  has two common meanings the first meaning ers to a  or  which values rural society as superior to urban society the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social valuesthompson paul 2010 “interview eighteen” in sustainability ethics 5 questions ed ryne raffaelle wade robinson and evan selinger united states automatic press  it stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life with its banks and factories
secondly the term agrarianism means political proposals for land redistribution specifically the distribution of land from the rich to the poor or landless this terminology is common in many countries and originated from the lex sempronia agraria or agrarian laws of rome in 133 bc imposed by  that seized public land ager publicus used by the rich and distributed it to the poorh h scullard from the gracchi to nero a history of rome from 133 bc to ad 68 1963 ch 2  this definition of agrarianism is commonly known as “agrarian orm”  in 18th  and 19th century england and ireland the word identified any land orm movement that sought to redistribute farm  lands more equally especially to landless irish families name google1993 
 defines agrarianism by the following basic tenetsm thomas inge ed agrarianism in american literature 1969 introduction http  xroadsvirginiaedu ~hyper hns yoeman agri1html paraphrased 
farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self sufficiency
urban life capitalism and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness
the agricultural community with its fellowship of labor and co operation is the model society
the farmer has a solid stable position in the world order he has a sense of identity a sense of historical and religious tradition a feeling of belonging to a concrete family place and region which are psychologically and culturally beneficial the harmony of his life checks the encroachments of a fragmented alienated modern society
cultivation of the soil has within it a positive spiritual good and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of honor manliness self reliance courage moral integrity and hospitality they result from a direct contact with nature and through nature a closer relationship to god the agrarian is blessed in that he follows the example of god in creating order out of chaos

peasant parties first appeared across eastern europe between 1860 and 1910 when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers agrarian parties advocated land orms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it they also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity

in  an angle is the figure formed by two  called the sides of the angle sharing a common endpoint called the  of the angle 
angles formed by two rays lie in a plane but this plane does not have to be a  angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in  these are called s angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection similar statements hold in space for example the  formed by two s on a  is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles
angle is also used to designate the  of an angle or of a  this measure is the ratio of the length of a  to its  in the case of a geometric angle the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides in the case of a rotation the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation
the word angle comes from the  word angulus meaning corner  words are the   ankylοs meaning crooked curved and the  word  both are connected with the  root ank  meaning to bend or bow 
  note ἀγκύλος rather than ἀνκύλος is correct the γκ is a digraph pronounced ŋk  
 defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other in a plane of two lines which meet each other and do not lie straight with respect to each other according to  an angle must be either a quality or a quantity or a relationship the first concept was used by  who regarded an angle as a deviation from a  the second by  who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines euclid adopted the third concept although his definitions of right acute and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative     this paragraph is quoted from eb1911 but its source seems to be heath  
in mathematical expressions it is common to use s varα var varβ var varγ var varθ var varφ var  to serve as  standing for the size of some angle to avoid confusion with its other meaning the symbol  is typically not used for this purpose lower case roman letters a b c  are also used as are upper case roman letters in the context of s see the figures in this article for examples
in geometric figures angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them for example the angle at vertex a enclosed by the rays ab and ac ie the lines from point a to point b and point a to point c is denoted ∠bac or math\widehat{\rm bac} math sometimes where there is no risk of confusion the angle may be erred to simply by its vertex angle a
potentially an angle denoted say ∠bac might er to any of four angles the clockwise angle from b to c the anticlockwise angle from b to c the clockwise angle from c to b or the anticlockwise angle from c to b where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign see  however in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant and no ambiguity arises otherwise a convention may be adopted so that ∠bac always ers to the anticlockwise positive angle from b to c and ∠cab to the anticlockwise positive angle from c to b

angles smaller than a right angle less than 90° are called acute angles acute meaning sharp
an angle equal to  turn 90° or  radians is called a   two lines that form a right angle are said to be   or 
angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle between 90° and 180° are called obtuse angles obtuse meaning blunt
an angle equal to  turn 180° or  radians is called a straight angle
angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn between 180° and 360° are called lex angles
an angle equal to 1 turn 360° or 2 radians is called a full angle complete angle or a perigon

angles that have the same measure ie the same magnitude are said to be equal or  an angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle eg all right angles are equal in measure
two angles which share terminal sides but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn are called coterminal angles
a erence angle is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle  turn 180° or  radians to the results as necessary until the magnitude of result is an acute angle a value between 0 and  turn 90° or  radians for example an angle of 30 degrees has a erence angle of 30 degrees and an angle of 150 degrees also has a erence angle of 30 degrees 180 – 150 an angle of 750 degrees has a erence angle of 30 degrees 750 – 720http  wwwmathwordscom r erence_anglehtm 
when two straight lines intersect at a point four angles are formed pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other
a pair of angles opposite each other formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an x like shape are called vertical angles or opposite angles or vertically opposite angles they are abbreviated as vert opp ∠s name tb 
the equality of vertically opposite angles is called the vertical angle theorem  attributed the proof to  proposition i13  name william g shute 1960 pp 25 27william g shute william w shirk george f porter plane and solid geometry american book company 1960 pp 25 27  the proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles the vertical angles are equal in measure according to a historical note name william g shute 1960 pp 25 27  when thales visited egypt he observed that whenever the egyptians drew two intersecting lines they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as all straight angles are equal equals added to equals are equal and equals subtracted from equals are equal
in the figure assume the measure of angle a   x when two adjacent angles form a straight line they are supplementary theore the measure of angle c   180 − x similarly the measure of angle d   180 − x both angle c and angle d have measures equal to 180 − x and are congruent since angle b is supplementary to both angles c and d either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of angle b using the measure of either angle c or angle d we find the measure of angle b   180 − 180 − x   180 − 180 + x   x theore both angle a and angle b have measures equal to x and are equal in measure
adjacent angles often abbreviated as adj ∠s are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points in other words they are angles that are side by side or adjacent sharing an arm adjacent angles which sum to a right angle straight angle or full angle are special and are respectively called complementary supplementary and explementary angles see combine angle pairs below
a  is a line that intersects a pair of often parallel lines and is associated with alternate interior angles corresponding angles interior angles and exterior angles 
there are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles
complementary angles are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle  turn 90° or  radians if the two complementary angles are adjacent their non shared sides form a right angle in euclidean geometry the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees
the adjective complementary is from latin complementum associated with the verb complere to fill up an acute angle is filled up by its complement to form a right angle
the difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the complement of the angle
if angles a and b are complementary the following relationships hold
math\sin^2a + \sin^2b   1 \quad \cos^2a + \cos^2b   1 math
math \tan a   \cot b  \quad  \quad \quad \sec a   \csc b math
the  of an angle equals the  of its complement and its secant equals the  of its complement
the  co  in the names of some trigonometric ratios ers to the word complementary
two angles that sum to a straight angle  turn 180° or  radians are called supplementary angles
if the two supplementary angles are  ie have a common  and share just one side their non shared sides form a  such angles are called a linear pair of angles  however supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line and can be separated in space  for example adjacent angles of a  are supplementary and opposite angles of a  one whose vertices all fall on a single circle are supplementary
if a point p is exterior to a circle with center o and if the  from p touch the circle at points t and q then ∠tpq and ∠toq are supplementary
the sines of supplementary angles are equal their cosines and tangents unless undefined are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs
in euclidean geometry any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle
two angles that sum to a complete angle 1 turn 360° or 2 radians are called explementary angles or conjugate angles
the difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the explement of the angle or conjugate of an angle

an angle that is part of a  is called an  if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon a simple  has at least one interior angle that is a lex angle
in  the measures of the interior angles of a  add up to  radians 180° or  turn the measures of the interior angles of a simple   add up to 2 radians 360° or 1 turn in general the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex  with n sides add up to nampnbsp−ampnbsp2 radians or 180nampnbsp−ampnbsp2 degrees 2nampnbsp−ampnbsp4 right angles or ampnbsp−ampnbsp1 turn
the supplement of an interior angle is called an  that is an interior angle and an exterior angle form a  there are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal an exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon  if the corresponding interior angle is a lex angle the exterior angle should be considered  even in a non simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle but one will have to pick an  of the  or  to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure
in euclidean geometry the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn 360° the exterior angle here could be called a supplementary exterior angle exterior angles are commonly used in  when drawing regular polygons  
in a  the  of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are  meet at a single point name johnsonjohnson roger a advanced euclidean geometry dover publications 2007 
in a triangle three intersection points each of an external angle bisector with the opposite  are  name johnson 
 in a triangle three intersection points two of them between an interior angle bisector and the opposite side and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and the opposite side extended are collinear name johnson 
some authors use the name exterior angle of a simple polygon to simply mean the explement exterior angle not supplement of the interior angle as cited in   this conflicts with the above usage
the angle between two  such as two adjacent faces of a  is called a  it may be defined as the acute angle between two lines  to the planes
the angle between a plane and an intersecting straight line is equal to ninety degrees minus the angle between the intersecting line and the line that goes through the point of intersection and is normal to the plane

the size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other angles that have the same size are said to be equal or congruent or equal in measure
in some contexts such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the orientation of an object in two dimensions relative to a erence orientation angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full  are effectively equivalent  in other contexts such as identifying a point on a  curve or describing the cumulative rotation of an object in two dimensions relative to a erence orientation angles that differ by a non zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent
in order to measure an angle var var a  centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn eg with a pair of  the ratio of the length vars var of the arc by the radius varr var of the circle is the measure of the angle in s
the measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor  where k is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit for example 360 for  or 400 for s
math \theta   k \frac{s}{2\pi r}  math
the value of varθ var thus defined is independent of the size of the circle if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion so the ratio s r is unaltered proof the formula above can be rewritten as  one turn for which  units corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circles  which is 2r so  substituting n for θ and 2r for s in the formula results in  
the angle addition postulate states that if b is in the interior of angle aoc then
math m\angle aoc   m\angle aob + m\angle boc  math
the measure of the angle aoc is the sum of the measure of angle aob and the measure of angle boc
in this postulate it does not matter in which  the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit
   the less remarkable units may be removed from this sectionadd them to angular unit if they are not there yet     
units used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order of these units the  and the  are by far the most commonly used  angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of

although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and or rotations in opposite directions relative to some erence
in a two dimensional  an angle is typically defined by its two sides with its vertex at the origin the initial side is on the positive  while the other side or terminal side is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians degrees or turns with positive angles representing rotations toward the positive  and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative y axis  when cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position defined by the x axis rightward and the y axis upward positive rotations are  and negative rotations are 
in many contexts an angle of −θ is effectively equivalent to an angle of one full turn minus θ for example an orientation represented as ampnbsp−45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360°ampnbsp−ampnbsp45° or 315°  however a rotation of ampnbsp−45° would not be the same as a rotation of 315°
in three dimensional geometry clockwise and anticlockwise have no absolute meaning so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some erence which is typically a  passing through the angles vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie
in   are measured relative to north  by convention viewed from above bearing angle are positive clockwise so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north east orientation negative bearings are not used in navigation so a north west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°
there are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation
the  or gradient is equal to the  of the angle or sometimes rarely the  a gradient is often expressed as a percentage for very small values less than 5% the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians
in  the  between two lines is defined at the square of the sine of the angle between the lines since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines
astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation
 05° is approximately the width of the sun or moon
 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arms length
 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arms length
 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arms length
these measurements clearly depend on the individual subject and the above should be treated as rough  approximations only

math \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}   \cos  \theta  \ \left\  \mathbf{u} \right\  \ \left\  \mathbf{v} \right\   math
this formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes or curved surfaces from their s and between  from their vector equations
to define angles in an abstract real  we replace the euclidean dot product  ·  by the inner product math \langle \cdot  \cdot \rangle  math ie
math \langle \mathbf{u}  \mathbf{v} \rangle   \cos\theta\ \left\  \mathbf{u} \right\ \ \left\  \mathbf{v} \right\   math
in a complex  the expression for the cosine above may give non real values so it is replaced with
math \operatorname{re} \left \langle \mathbf{u}  \mathbf{v} \rangle \right   \cos\theta\ \left\  \mathbf{u} \right\  \ \left\  \mathbf{v} \right\   math

math \left  \langle \mathbf{u}  \mathbf{v} \rangle \right      \cos\theta   \ \left\  \mathbf{u} \right\  \ \left\  \mathbf{v} \right\   math
the latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one dimensional subspaces math\operatorname{span}\mathbf{u} math and math\operatorname{span}\mathbf{v} math spanned by the vectors math\mathbf{u} math and math\mathbf{v} math correspondingly

 is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and  is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture accordingly the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music medicine architecture industrial production warfare and more likewise animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories art craft science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole as in many other fields of knowledge s wheel of acoustics is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics

the eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation in the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were  in germany who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics and  in england who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work the theory of sound 1877  also in the 19th century wheatstone ohm and henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics
the twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place the first such application was ’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics and many others followed underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first world war   and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society  sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing  the ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry  new kinds of transducers generators and receivers of acoustic energy were invented and put to use
acoustics is defined by  as a science of  including its production transmission and effects including biological and psychological effects b those qualities of a room that together determine its character with respect to auditory effects
the study of acoustics revolves around the generation propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations
the steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process there are many kinds of cause both natural and volitional there are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy producing a sound wave there is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation the  but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex the wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms in ways that again may be natural and or volitionally contrived the final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains the five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an  a submarine using sonar to locate its foe or a band playing in a rock concert
the central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation this falls within the domain of physical acoustics in s sound propagates primarily as a  in solids mechanical waves can take many forms including   and 
acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment this interaction can be described as either a   or a  or a mix of the three if several  are present a  can also occur transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics
in fluids such as air and water sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level  while this disturbance is usually small it is still noticeable to the human ear  the smallest sound that a person can hear known as the  is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure  the loudness of these disturbances is called the  spl and is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels
physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies partly because this is how our  interpret sound what we experience as higher pitched or lower pitched sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second in a common technique of acoustic measurement acoustic signals are sampled in time and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon
the entire spectrum can be divided into three sections  audio ultrasonic and infrasonic  the audio range falls between 20  and 20000ampnbsphz  this range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear  this range has a number of applications including speech communication and music  the ultrasonic range ers to the very high frequencies 20000ampnbsphz and higher  this range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies  medical applications such as  and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range  on the other end of the spectrum the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range  these frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes
analytic instruments such as the  facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties  the  produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character
a  is a device for converting one form of energy into another  in an electroacoustic context this means converting sound energy into electrical energy or vice versa electroacoustic transducers include s   and  projectors these devices convert a sound pressure wave to or from an electric signal the most widely used transduction principles are   and 
the transducers in most common s eg s and s are electromagnetic  devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic  sending off pressure waves s and s employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphones diaphragm it moves and induces a voltage change the ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers these are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself
an acoustician is an expert in the science of sound 
there are many types of acoustician but they usually have a  or higher qualification some possess a degree in acoustics while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as  or  much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in  and  many acoustic scientists work in research and development some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception eg   or  of   and  other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments eg   or  others areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below acoustic scientists work in government university and private industry laboratories many go on to work in  some positions such as  require a

 is the study of noise generated by air movement for instance via turbulence and the movement of sound through the fluid air this knowledge is applied in  to study how to quieten   is important to understanding how wind s work 
acoustic signal processing is the electronic manipulation of acoustic signals applications include  design for s or s   and perceptual coding eg  or  
architectural acoustics also known as building acoustics involves the scientific understanding of how to achieve a good sound within a building  it typically involves the study of speech intelligibility speech privacy and music quality in the built environment 
 is the scientific study of the hearing and calls of animal calls as well as how animals are affected by the acoustic and sounds of their habitat 
this subdiscipline is concerned with the recording manipulation and reproduction of audio using electronics  this might include products such as s large scale  systems or  systems in research laboratories
environmental acoustics is concerned with noise and vibration caused by railways   road traffic aircraft industrial equipment and recreational activities  the main aim of these studies is to reduce levels of environmental noise and vibration research work now also has a focus on the positive use of sound in urban environments s and  
musical acoustics is the study of the physics of acoustic instruments the  used in electronic music the computer analysis of music and composition and the perception and  
 explains how humans respond to sounds 
acousticians study the production processing and perception of speech  and  are two important areas of speech processing using computers the subject also overlaps with the disciplines of    and  
ultrasonics deals with sounds at frequencies too high to be heard by humans specialisms include medical ultrasonics including   material characterisation and   
underwater acoustics is the scientific study of natural and man made sounds underwater applications include  to locate  underwater communication by whales climate change monitoring by measuring sea temperatures acoustically sonic weapons  and marine  
this is the study of how mechanical systems vibrate and interact with their surroundings applications might include  from railways  to reduce vibration in operating theatres studying how vibration can damage health   to protect a building from  or measuring how structure borne sound moves through buildings

atomic physics is the field of  that studies atoms as an isolated system of s and an  it is primarily concerned with the  and
the processes by which these arrangements change this includes  as well as neutral atoms and unless otherwise stated for the purposes of this discussion it should be assumed that the term atom includes ions
the term atomic physics is often associated with  and s due to the ous use of atomic and nuclear in  however physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and  which considers  alone
as with many scientific fields strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of  physics research groups are usually so classified
today atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons it is not concerned with the formation of s although much of the physics is identical nor does it examine atoms in a  as  it is concerned with processes such as  and  by photons or collisions with atomic particles
while modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic if one considers atoms in a  or  then the time scales for atom atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered this means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation as the vast majority of the time they are  by this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in  and  even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms
electrons form notional  around the nucleus these are normally in a  but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light s magnetic fields or interaction with a colliding particle typically ions or other electrons
 electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a   the energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell taking it to infinity is called the   any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to  according to the   the atom is said to have undergone the process of 
if the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy it will be transferred to an  after a certain time the electron in an excited state will jump undergo a transition to a lower state in a neutral atom the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy since energy is conserved
if an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy so that the atom ionizes then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital in this case a visible photon or a  is emitted or a phenomenon known as the  may take place where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron causing it to go into the continuum  the auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon
there are rather strict  as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light — however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes
the majority of fields in physics can be divided between theoretical work and experimental work
and atomic physics is no exception it is usually the case but not always that progress goes
in alternate cycles from an experimental observation through to a theoretical explanation
followed by some predictions that may or may not be confirmed by experiment and so on of course the current state of technology at any given time can put limitations on what can be achieved experimentally and theoretically so it may take considerable time for theory to be ined
one of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed
of atoms it forms a part of the texts written in 6th century bc to 2nd century bc such as those of  or  written by  this theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a  by the british chemist and physicist  in the 18th century at this stage it wasnt clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties in bulk the invention of the  by  was another great step forward
the true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of s and attempts to describe the phenomenon most notably by  the study of these lines led to the  and to the birth of  in seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed as far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned not only did this yield a better overall description ie the  but it also provided a new theoretical basis for 
 and 
since the  both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace this can be attributed to progress in computing technology which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes  similar technological advances in accelerators detectors magnetic field generation and s have greatly assisted experimental work
   perhaps create to a category list instead and embed names in history theory section later

american sign language asl is the predominant  of  in the  and most of anglophone  besides  dialects of asl and asl based  are used in many countries around the world including much of  and parts of  asl is also widely learned as a  serving as a  asl is most closely related to  lsf it has been proposed that asl is a  although asl shows features atypical of creole languages such as 
asl originated in the early 19th century in the  asd in  from a situation of  since then asl use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and deaf community organizations despite its wide use no accurate count of asl users has been taken though reliable estimates for american asl users range from 250000 to 500000 persons including a number of  asl users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of  to sign language compounded by the fact that asl is often  in english due to the lack of a standard writing system
asl signs have a number of  components including movement of the face and torso as well as the hands asl is not a form of  but  does play a larger role in asl than in spoken languages english s are often borrowed through  although asl grammar is unrelated to that of english asl has  verbal  and  and has a productive system of forming agglutinative  many linguists believe asl to be a  svo language but there are several alternative proposals to account for asl word order
asl emerged as a language in the american school for the deaf asd founded in 1814 name bahan  this school brought together  various s and  systems asl was created in this situation of  name padden   group nbin particular   and  were brought to the school by students these in turn appear to have been influenced by early  and did not involve input from indigenous native american sign systems see   and   asl was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them name bahan 
the influence of french sign language lsf on asl is readily apparent for example it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern asl are  to  signs name bahan  name padden  however this is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually s name padden   this suggests that nascent asl was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the asd students despite the fact that the schools original director  taught in lsf name bahan  name padden   in fact clerc reported that he often learned the students signs rather than conveying lsf name padden 
it has been proposed that asl is a  with lsf as the  language and with the native village sign languages as  languages name kegl  however more recent research has shown that modern asl does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages name kegl  asl may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time but it is also possible that it was never a creole type language name kegl   there are modality specific reasons that sign languages tend towards  for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face head torso and other body parts this might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards  name kegl  additionally clerc and gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of  in instruction rather than true lsf name kegl 
although the united states the  and  share  as a common oral and written language asl is not mutually intelligible with  bsl or  name johnson  all three languages show degrees of borrowing from english but this alone is not sufficient for cross language comprehension name johnson   it has been found that a relatively high percentage 37–44% of asl signs have similar translations in auslan which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same  name johnson   however this does not seem justified historically for asl and auslan and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of  in sign languages in general as well as contact with english name johnson  
american sign language is growing in popularity among many states many people in high school and colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language but until recently it was not a creditable foreign language elective the issue was that many didnt consider it a foreign language asl users however have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking their facial expressions and hand movements lect what they are conveying they also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart 
american sign language is now being accepted by many colleges as a foreign language credit many states are making it mandatory to accept it american sign language can help young adults better connect with the deaf community
prior to the birth of asl sign language had been used by various communities in the united states name bahan  in the united states as elsewhere in the world hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc  which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation name bahan  as early as 1541 at first contact by  there were reports that the  had developed  to communicate between tribes of different languagesceil lucas 1995 the sociolinguistics of the deaf community p 80 
in the 19th century a triangle of s developed in  one in  massachusetts one in  and one in  name lane_pillard_french   mvsl which was particularly important for the history of asl was used mainly in  name bahan  due to intermarriage in the original community of english settlers of the 1690s and the recessive nature of genetic deafness chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness name bahan  mvsl was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present name bahan 
asl is thought to have originated in the  asd founded in  in 1817 name bahan  originally known as the american asylum at hartford for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb the school was founded by the yale graduate and divinity student  name asd  name dhm  gallaudet inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl  traveled to europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from european institutions name asd   ultimately gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the french  and convinced  an assistant to the schools founder  to accompany him back to the united states name asd   group nbthe   founder of the parisian school  was the first to acknowledge that sign language could be used to educate the deaf an oft repeated folk tale states that while visiting a parishioner Épee met two deaf daughters conversing with each other using lsf the mother explained that her daughters were being educated privately by means of pictures Épée is said to have been inspired by these deaf children when he established the first educational institution for the deaf see
 
 
  upon his return gallaudet founded the asd on april 15 1817 name asd  
the largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from marthas vineyard and they brought mvsl with them name padden  there were also 44 students from around  and 27 from the sandy river valley in maine each of which had their own village sign language name padden  group nbwhereas deafness was genetically recessive on marthas vineyard it was dominant in henniker on the one hand this dominance likely aided the development of sign language in henniker since families would be more likely to have the critical mass of deaf people necessary for the propagation of signing on the other hand in marthas vineyard the deaf were more likely to have more hearing relatives which may have fostered a sense of shared identity that led to more inter group communication than in henniker see   other students brought knowledge of their own home signs name padden    the first teacher at asd taught using  lsf which itself had developed in the parisian school for the deaf established in 1755 name bahan  from this situation of  a new language emerged now known as asl name bahan 
more schools for the deaf were founded after asd and knowledge of asl spread to these schools name bahan  in addition the rise of deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of asl name bahan  societies such as the  and the national fraternal society of the deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country name padden  this all contributed to asls wide use over a large geographical area atypical of a sign language name padden   name padden  
up to the 1950s the predominant method in deaf education was  – acquiring oral language comprehension and production name stokoe  linguists did not consider sign language to be true language but rather something inferior name stokoe   recognition of the legitimacy of asl was achieved by  a linguist who arrived at  in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption name stokoe   aided by the civil rights movement of the 1960s stokoe argued for  the use of sign language in deaf education name stokoe  stokoe william c 1960 http  saveourdeafschoolsorg stokoe_1960pdf sign language structure an outline of the visual communication systems of the american deaf studies in linguistics occasional papers no 8 buffalo dept of anthropology and linguistics university of buffalo  stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication and even devised a  system for asl name stokoe   in doing so stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics name stokoe   in the 1960s asl was sometimes erred to as ameslan but this term is now considered obsolete 
counting the number of asl speakers is difficult because asl users have never been counted by the american census name mitchell  group nbalthough some surveys of smaller scope measure asl use such as the california department of education recording asl use in the home when children begin school asl use in the general american population has not been directly measured see   the ultimate source for current estimates of the number of asl users in the united states is a report for the national census of the deaf population ncdp by schein and delk 1974 name mitchell  based on a 1972 survey of the ncdp schein and delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250000 and 500000 name mitchell  the survey did not distinguish between asl and other forms of signing in fact the name asl was not yet in widespread use name mitchell 
incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of asl speakers in the united states based on misunderstandings of known statistics name mitchell  demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of asl use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use asl in the home name mitchell  this accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500000 such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15000000 name mitchell  a 100000 person lower bound has been cited for asl users the source of this figure is unclear but it may be an estimate of  which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing name mitchell 
asl is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third  or fourth most spoken language in the united states name mitchell  these figures misquote schein and delk 1974 who actually concluded that asl speakers constituted the third largest population requiring an interpreter in court name mitchell  although this would make asl the third most used language among s other than english it does not imply that it is the fourth most spoken language in the united states since speakers of other languages may also speak english name mitchell 
asl is used throughout  name padden  this contrasts with europe where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent name padden   the unique situation of asl seems to have been caused by the proliferation of asl through schools influenced by the american school for the deaf wherein asl originated and the rise of community organizations for the deaf name padden 
throughout  asl based sign languages are spoken by educated deaf adults name nyst  these languages imported by boarding schools are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly eg   name nyst  such signing systems are found in         and  name nyst  due to lack of data it is still an open question how similar these sign languages are to the variety of asl used in america name nyst 
in addition to the aforementioned west african countries asl is reported to be used as a  in   benoit duchateau arminjon 2013 https  booksgooglecom booksid q1jortiybt0camppg pa180ampdq %22cambodian+sign+language%22ampcd 2#v onepageampq %22cambodian%20sign%20language%22ampf false healing cambodia one child at a time p 180  the     the      the   and  name eth   asl is also used as a  throughout the deaf world widely learned as a  name eth  
varieties of asl are found throughout the world there is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the united states and canada name eth at ethnologue 
 among these asl varieties is high and the variation is primarily  name eth   for example there are three different words for english about in canadian asl the standard way and two regional variations atlantic and ontario as shown in the videos on the right name about   variation may also be  meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region for example an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes  1   l  and  5  in signs with one handshape name lbv36 
there is also a distinct variety of asl used by the black deaf community name eth   black asl evolved as a result of  in some states which included the residential schools for the deaf name solomon  black asl differs from standard asl in vocabulary phonology and some grammatical structure name eth   name solomon   while  aave is generally viewed as more innovating than standard english black asl is more conservative than standard asl preserving older forms of many signs name solomon   black sign language speakers use more two handed signs than in mainstream asl are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead eg know and use a wider signing space name solomon   modern black asl borrows a number of idioms from aave for instance the aave idiom i feel you is d into black asl name solomon  
asl is used internationally as a  and a number of closely related sign languages derived from asl are used in many different countries name eth   even so there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard asl in these imported asl varieties  is reported to be a dialect of asl no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects name beth at ethnologue  on the other hand it is also known that some imported asl varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages for example  which has asl origins is no longer mutually comprehensible with asl and must be considered its own language  for some imported asl varieties such as those used in west africa it is still an open question how similar they are to american asl name nyst 
when communicating with hearing english speakers asl speakers often use what is commonly called  pse or contact signing a blend of english structure with asl name eth   name deaflib   various types of pse exist ranging from highly english influenced pse practically  english to pse which is quite close to asl lexically and grammatically but may alter some subtle features of asl grammar name deaflib   fingerspelling may be used more often in pse than it is normally used in asl name cxxv   there have been some  known as  mce which match english grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs these systems are not considered to be varieties of asl name eth   name deaflib  
 tasl is a variety of asl used throughout the united states by and with the  name eth   it is particularly common among those with  found especially in  and  name eth   this syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life consequently those with ushers syndrome often grow up in the deaf community using asl and later transition to tasl name usher  tasl differs from asl in that signs are produced by touching the palms and there are some grammatical differences from standard asl in order to compensate for the lack of non manual signing name eth  
in 2013 the white house published a response to a petition that gained over 37000 signatures to officially recognize american sign language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools the response is titled there shouldnt be any stigma about american sign language and addressed that asl is a vital language for the deaf and hard of hearing stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in childrens lives when they can access languages most effectively  scholars such as  advocate not only for  using asl and english training but also for  for children who are deaf

although there is no well established writing system for asl name sup  written sign language dates back almost two centuries the first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of  developed in 1825 name vhc  however written sign language remained marginal among the public name vhc  in the 1960s linguist william stokoe created  specifically for asl it is alphabetic with a letter or  for every  distinctive hand shape orientation motion and position though it lacks any representation of facial expression and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text name armstrong david f 2009armstrong david f and michael a karchmer william c stokoe and the study of signed languages sign language studies 94 2009 389 397 academic search premier web 7 june 2012  stokoe used this system for his 1965 a dictionary of american sign language on linguistic principlesstokoe william c dorothy c casterline carl g croneberg 1965 a dictionary of american sign languages on linguistic principles washington dc gallaudet college press 
 proposed in 1974 by  name vhc  is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the  name eversonunicode  signwriting consists of more than 5000 distinct iconic graphs glyphs name vhc  currently it is in use in many schools for the deaf particularly in brazil and has been used in international sign language forums with speakers and researchers in more than 40 countries including brazil ethiopia france germany italy portugal saudi arabia slovenia tunisia and the united states sutton signwriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written personal letters newspapers and media academic research the systematic examination of the international sign writing alphabet iswa as an equivalent usage structure to the  for spoken languages has been proposedcharles butler center for sutton movement writing 2014  according to some researchers signwriting is not a  and does not have a one to one map from phonological forms to written forms name vhc  this assertion has been disputed and the process for each country to look at the iswa and create a phonemic morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers msc roberto cesar reis da costa and madson barreto in a thesis forum on june 23 2014  the signwriting community has an https  wikitechwikimediaorg wiki nova_resourcesignwriting open project on https  wwwmediawikiorg wiki wikimedia_labs wikimedia labs to support the various wikimedia projects  on https  incubatorwikimediaorg wiki incubatormain_page wikimedia incubator  and elsewhere involving signwriting  the asl wikipedia request was marked as eligible in 2008  and the test https  incubatorwikimediaorg wiki wp ase asl wikipedia has 50 articles written in asl using signwriting
the most widely used  system among academics is  developed at the  name vhc  based on stokoe notation hamnosys was expanded to about 200 graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language name vhc  phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol name vhc 
several additional candidates for written asl have appeared over the years including    and 
for english speaking audiences asl is often  using english words these glosses are typically all capitalized and are arranged in asl order for example the asl sentence dog now chaseix 3 cat meaning the dog is chasing the cat uses now to mark asl  and shows asl verbal inflection for the third person written with ix 3 however glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of asl name sup  
each sign in asl is composed of a number of distinctive components a sign may use one hand or both each hand assumes a  with a particular  in a particular  on the body or in the signing space and may involve  name bahan  changing any one of these may change the meaning of a sign as illustrated by the asl signs think and disappointed

 }
there are also meaningful  in asl name bahan  this may include movement of the eyebrows the cheeks the nose the head the torso and the eyes name bahan 
 proposed that these components are analogous to the s of spoken languages name vhc  group nbstokoe himself termed these s but other linguists have erred to them as phonemes see   there has also been a proposal that these are analogous to classes like  and  name vhc  as in spoken languages these phonological units can be split into s name bahan  for instance the handshapes  2  and  3  are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature ± closed thumb as illustrated to the right name bahan  asl has processes of  and  restrictions name bahan  there is ongoing research into whether asl has an analog of s in spoken language name bahan 
asl has a rich system of verbal  this involves both —how the action of verbs flows in time—and  marking name bahan  aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb for example  is marked by incorporating rhythmic circular movement while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position name bahan  verbs may agree with both the  and the  and are marked for  and reciprocity name bahan  reciprocity is indicated by using two one handed signs for example the sign shoot made with an l shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb inflects to shootsubreciprocal sub articulated by having two l shaped hands shooting at each other name bahan 
asl has a productive system of  which are used to classify objects and their movement in space name bahan  for example a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent v classifier handshape with a downhill directed path if the rabbit is hopping the path is executed with a bouncy manner name bahan  in general classifiers are composed of a classifier handshape  to a movement root name bahan  the classifier handshape represents the object as a whole incorporating such attributes as surface depth and shape and is usually very iconic  the movement root consists of a path a direction and a manner name bahan 
 
asl possesses a set of 26 signs known as the  which can be used to spell out words from the english language name cxxiv  these signs make use of the 19 handshapes of asl  for example the signs for p and k use the same handshape but different orientations a common misconception is that asl consists only of fingerspelling although such a method  has been used it is not asl name cxxv 
fingerspelling is a form of  a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another name cxxv   in asl fingerspelling is used for  and for technical terms with no native asl equivalent name cxxv   there are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled either very short english words or abbreviations of longer english words eg o n from english on and a p t from english apartment name cxxv   fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise name cxxv  
the basic word order of asl is disputed most linguists agree that asl is a  svo language with various phenomena affecting this basic word order name neidle 2000 59  basic svo sentences are signed without any pauses name valli 2005 84 
however other word orders may also occur as asl allows the  of a sentence to be moved to sentence initial position a phenomenon known as   in  osv sentences the object is topicalized marked by a forward head tilt and a pause name valli 2005 86 
even more word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy in subject copy the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence accompanied by head nodding either for clarification or emphasis name valli 2005 84 
asl also allows  sentences where the subject is implied rather than stated explicitly subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence in which the subject is omitted from its original position yielding a  vos construction name valli 2005 86 
topicalization accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy can produce yet another word order  ovs
these properties of asl allow it a variety of word orders leading many to question which is the true underlying basic order there are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in asl one proposal is that languages like asl are best described with a  structure where words are ordered by their importance in the sentence rather than by their syntactic properties  another hypothesis is that asl exhibits  in which syntax is not encoded in word order whatsoever but can be encoded by other means eg head nods eyebrow movement body position name neidle 2000 59 
a common misconception is that signs are iconically self explanatory that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean or even that they are  name cxxiii  in fact many signs bear no resemblance to their erent either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time name cxxiii   even so in asl  plays a significant role a high percentage of signs resemble their erents in some way name l60   this may be due to the fact that the medium of sign—three dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language name cxxiii  
in the era of the influential linguist  it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary name l60  although  is a clear exception since words like choo choo bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic the saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions  asl with its significant inventory of iconic signs directly challenges this theory name l62 
research on acquisition of pronouns in asl has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning it has been found that when children acquire the pronoun you the iconicity of the point at the child is often confused being treated more like a name name petitto  this is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition it has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs 
 
 
  of which asl has been one attempted mode

alternate history or alternative historybrave new words the oxford dictionary of science fiction  2007 notes the perred usage of alternate history as well as its primacy in coinage alternate history was coined in 1954 and alternative history was first used in 1977 pp4–5  sometimes abbreviated as ah  is a  of fiction consisting of stories that are  worlds in which one or more historical events unfolds differently from how they did in  it can be variously seen as a subgenre of   or  different alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres another term occasionally used for the genre is allohistory literally other history 
alternate history looks at what if scenarios from some of historys most pivotal turning points and presents a different version sometimes based on science and fact but often based on conjecture alternate history is the exploration of how the world would look today if various changes occurred and what these alternate worlds would be like forms the basis of this vast subject matter
since the 1950s this type of fiction has to a large extent merged with science fiction s involving time travel between alternate histories psychic awareness of the existence of our universe by the people in another or time travel that results in history splitting into two or more  cross time time splitting and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another 
in     and  the genre of alternate history is called uchronie   ucronia   ucronía   uchronie which has given rise to the term  in english this  is based on the pix ου  which in  means not not any no and the ancient greek χρόνος chronos meaning time a uchronia means literally in no time this term apparently also inspired the name of the alternate history book list  
in writing an alternate history the author makes the conscious choice to change something in our past according to  alternate history requires three things a  from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing a change that would alter history as it is known and an examination of the ramifications of that change name shs 
several  have been confused as alternate histories science fiction set in what was the future but is now the past like s  or  are not alternate history because the author did not make the conscious choice to change the past name shs    works that document things that are not known to have happened historically but would not have changed history had they happened is also not to be confused with alternate history name shs      another copy of the foregoing is available  and a different definition of secret history by the same writer is also searchable    
alternate history is related to but distinct from —the term used by some professional historians when using thoroughly researched and caully reasoned speculations on what might have happened if as a tool of academic historical research name counterfact 
the earliest example of an alternate or counterfactual history is found in s  book ix sections 17–19 livy contemplated an alternative 4th century bc in which  expanded his empire westward instead of eastward he asked what would have been the results for  if she had been engaged in war with alexander  name roads   livy concluded that the romans would likely have defeated alexander 
s 1490    written when the loss of  to the  was still a recent and traumatic memory to  tells the story of the valiant knight tirant the white from brittany who gets to the embattled remnant of the  becomes a  and commander of its armies and manages to fight off the invading  armies of  save the city from  and even chase the turks deeper into lands they had conquered before
in book ii chapter 17 of s  he discusses what impact gunpowder artillery would have had on the roman empire had it been invented 1500 years earlier and comes to the conclusion it would have made their conquests even greater as the primary advantage of artillery lies in attacking cities
one of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a popular audience may be the french s histoire de la monarchie universelle napoléon et la conquête du monde 1812–1832 history of the universal monarchy napoleon and the conquest of the world 1836 which imagines s  victorious in the  in 1811 and in an invasion of england in 1814 later unifying the world under bonapartes rule name roads  
in the  the first known complete alternate history is s   published in 1845 it recounts the tale of a man who is considered a madman due to him perceiving a different 1845 a reality in which long dead famous people are still alive such as the poets    and  the actor  the british politician  and even 
the first novel length alternate history in english would seem to be s  1895 while not as nationalistic as s napoléon et la conquête du monde 1812–1823 aristopia is another attempt to portray a utopian society in aristopia the earliest settlers in  discover a reef made of solid  and are able to build a n society in 
a number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries see for example  if a jacobite fantasy 1926  in 1931 british historian  collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period in the anthology  in this work scholars from major universities as well as important non university based authors turned their attention to such questions as if the moors in spain had won and if  had had an atom of firmness the essays range from serious scholarly efforts to s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century dutch city state on the island of  among the authors included were   and 
one of the entries in squires volume was churchills if lee had not won   please do not change the won it is intentionally part of the storys title    the battle of gettysburg written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the  had won the  considering what would have happened if the north   please do not change the word north it is accurate for this story    had been victorious in other words a character from an alternate world imagining a world more like the real one we live in although not identical in every detail this kind of speculative work which posts from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as a  a double blind what if or an alternate alternate historyhttp  wwwwinstonchurchillorg i4a pages indexcfmpageid 674    churchills essay was one of the influences behind s alternate universe novel  in which  won the  which paved the way for the eventual  victory in the  renamed the war of southron independence in this timeline  southron with two os is the word used in the novel and is not a misspelling   the protagonist autodidact hodgins backmaker travels back to the aforementioned battle and inadvertently changes history resulting in the emergence of our own timeline and the consequent victory of the union instead
american humorist author  parodied alternate history stories about the  in his 1930 story if grant had been drinking at appomattox which he accompanied with this very brief introduction scribners magazine is publishing a series of three articles if booth had missed lincoln if lee had won the battle of gettysburg and if napoleon had escaped to america this is the fourth
another example of alternate history from this period and arguably the first to explicitly posit  from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience is   1923 in which several englishmen are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross time machine into an alternate universe featuring a seemingly pacifistic and utopian britain when the englishmen led by a satiric figure based on winston churchill try to seize power the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone elses universe wells describes a  of alternative worlds complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with us pulp writers but since his hero experiences only a single alternate world this story is not very different from conventional alternate history 
the 1930s would see alternate history move into a new arena the december 1933 issue of  published by s ancestral voices quickly followed by s  while earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences leinster attempted something completely different in his world gone mad pieces of earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines the story follows professor minott and his students from a fictitious robinson college as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history
a somewhat similar approach was taken by  in his 1941 novelette  a professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines he then hypnotizes his students so they can explore more of them eventually each settles in the reality most suitable for him or her some of the worlds they visit are mundane some very odd and others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions
 produced alternate history for  both british and american  authors wrote works depicting nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales
 
the period around the second world war also saw the publication of the  novel  by  where an american academic travels to the  of the  at the time of the byzantine invasion led by  de camps work is concerned with the historical changes wrought by his time traveler martin padway thereby making the work an alternate history padway is depicted as making permanent changes and implicitly forming a new time branch
time travel as the cause of a  pod creating two histories where before there was one or simply replacing the future that existed before the time traveling event has continued to be a popular theme in s  the protagonist lives in an alternate history in which the  won the  and he travels through time and brings about a union victory in the 
when a storys assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited times future rather than just the creation of an additional time line the device of a time patrol is often used most notably in s  collection — where guardians race uptime and downtime to preserve the correct history in the most celebrated of this series  the interference of time travelling outlaws causes  to win the  and destroy  with massive consequences for the present day
a more recent example is  by  in which a time machine is used to alter history so that  was never born — which ironically results in a more competent nazi leader who has none of hitlers faults or  induced  resulting in nazi ascendancy and longevity in this altered timeline
hg wells cross time or many universes variant see above was fully developed by murray leinster in his 1934 short story  where sections of the earths surface begin changing places with their counterparts in alternate timelines
this subgenre was used early on for purposes far removed from quasi academic examination of alternative outcomes to historical events  employed it to satirize the science fiction pulps and their adolescent readers—and fears of foreign invasion—in the classic  1949 in s  1953 the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed but where a band of mutants is establishing a colony the story line appears to frame the authors anxieties regarding  and the 
 
in the late 1940s and the 1950s however writers such as   and  wrote thrillers set in a  in which all alternate histories are co existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and or paratime capsules these authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of  style secret agents piper called them the 
this concept provided a convenient framing for packing a smorgasbord of historical alternatives and even of timeline branches into a single novel either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villains through multiple worlds or less artfully via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors or between paratime agents and new recruits regarding the histories of such worlds
the paratime theme is sometimes used without the police  dreamed up the old phoenix tavern as a nexus between alternate histories a character from a modern american alternate history operation chaos can thus appear in the english civil war setting of a midsummers tempest in this context the distinction between an alternate history and a parallel universe with some points in common but no common history may not be feasible as the writer may not provide enough information to distinguish
paratime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the  of  first formulated by  in 1957 to account for the differing worlds some science fiction writers interpret the splitting of worlds to depend on human decision making and free will while others rely on the  from  to amplify random differences at the atomic or subatomic level into a  divergence at some specific point in history either way science fiction writers usually have all changes flow from a particular historical point of divergence often abbreviated pod by fans of the genre prior to everett science fiction writers drew on higher dimensions and the speculations of  to explain their characters cross time journeys
 
while many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse the many world theory would naturally involve many worlds in fact a continually exploding array of universes in quantum theory new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event and even if the writer uses human decisions every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline a writers fictional multiverse may in fact preclude some decisions as humanly impossible as when in   depicts a character informing vimes that while anything that can happen has happened nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which vimes has ever murdered his wife when the writer explicitly maintains that all possible decisions are made in all possible ways one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave nor clever nor skilled but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route take the stupid action fumble the crucial activity etc few writers focus on this idea although it has been explored in stories such as s story  where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import
in any case even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite it is still possible to assign a different  to different infinite sets the physicist  a strong advocate of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has argued along these lines saying that by making good choices doing the right thing we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives when you succeed all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too what you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen  this view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories but a few writers have tried such as  in his short story the infinite assassin where an agent is trying to contain reality scrambling whirlpools that form around users of a certain drug and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves
many writers—perhaps the majority—avoid the discussion entirely in one novel of this type h beam pipers  a pennsylvania state police officer who knows how to make gunpowder is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors the paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it where the country will be overrun but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved
the cross time theme was further developed in the 1960s by  in the first three volumes of his imperium sequence which would be completed in zone yellow 1990 pipers politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by  and  in the 1980s chalkers  trilogy 1987–89 featuring paratime detectives sam and brandy horowitz marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural kurlands  1988 the first volume of the never completed chronicles of elsewhen presents a multiverse of secretive cross time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross time travel ranging from high tech capsules to mutant powers harry turtledove has launched the  series for teenagers featuring a variant of h beam pipers paratime trading empire
 
the concept of a cross time version of a world war involving rival paratime empires was developed in s change war series starting with the  winning  1958 followed by s timeliner trilogy in the 1970s s a greater infinity 1982 and  timeline wars trilogy in the 1990s
such paratime stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next providing a science fictional explanation—or veneer—for what is normally fantasy s doc sidhe and sidhe devil take place between our world the grim world and an alternate fair world where the sidhe retreated to although technology is clearly present in both worlds and the fair world parallels our history about fifty years out of step there is functional magic in the fair world even with such explanation the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world the more likely the story is to be labelled fantasy as in poul andersons house rule and losers night  in both science fiction and fantasy whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear the writer might allude to a pod only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept or may present the universe without explanation to its existence
in 1962 philip k dick published the man in the high castle an alternate history in which nazi germany and imperial japan won world war ii this book contained an example of alternate alternate history in that one of its characters is the author of a book depicting a reality in which the allies won the war itself divergent from real world history in several aspects
it was followed by vladimir nabokovs ada or ardor a family chronicle 1969 a story of incest that takes place within an alternate north america settled in part by czarist russia and that borrows from dicks idea of alternate alternate history the world of nabokovs hero is wracked by rumors of a counter earth that apparently is ours some critics believe that the erences to a counter earth suggest that the world portrayed in ada is a delusion in the mind of the hero another favorite theme of dicks novels strikingly the characters in ada seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version calling it anti terra while its mythical twin is the real terra not only history but science has followed a divergent path on anti terra it boasts all the same technology as our world but all based on water instead of electricity when a character in ada makes a long distance call all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power
isaac asimovs short story what if   is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television like device this idea can also be found in asimovs 1955 novel the end of eternity in that novel the eternals can change the realities of the world without people being aware of it
guido morselli described the defeat of italy and subsequently france in world war i in his 1975 novel past conditional contro passato prossimo where the static alpine front line which divided italy from austria during that war collapses when the germans and the austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance
kingsley amis set his 1976 novel the alteration in the 20th century but major events in the reformation did not take place and protestantism is limited to the breakaway republic of new england martin luther was reconciled to the roman catholic church and later became pope germanian i
the plot against america 2004 by philip roth looks at an america where franklin d roosevelt is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as president of the united states and charles lindbergh is elected leading to increasing fascism and anti semitism in the us
michael chabon occasionally an author of speculative fiction contributed to the genre with his 2007 novel the yiddish policemens union this book explores a world in which the state of israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the worlds jews instead live in a small strip of alaska set aside by the us government for jewish settlement the story follows a jewish detective solving a murder case in the yiddish speaking city of sitka stylistically chabon borrows heavily from the noir and detective fiction genres while exploring social issues related to jewish history and culture apart from the alternate history of the jews and israel chabon also plays with other common tropes of ah fiction in the book germany actually loses the war even harder than in they did reality getting hit with a nuclear bomb instead of just simply losing a ground war subverting the common what if germany won wwii trope
the late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular fiction versions of alternate history fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author  as well as the development of the  genre and two series of anthologies—the what might have been series edited by  and the alternate  series edited by  this period also saw alternate history works by     and others

perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which  in some versions the nazis and or  conquer the entire world in others they conquer most of the world but a fortress america exists under siege while in others there is a nazi japanese  comparable to the us soviet equivalent in our timeline  1992 by  is set in europe following the nazi victory several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future or paratime travel for instance s   wrote  in 1972 which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by  after fleeing from europe to north america in the 1920s

many fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world but with magic added some posit points of divergence but some also feature magic altering history all along one example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is poul andersons  in which the  is history and the fairy folk are real and powerful a partly familiar european history for which the author provides a point of divergence is s  series a monk systemizing magic rather than science so the use of  to treat heart disease is called superstition the other great point of divergence in this timeline occurs in 1199 when  survives the  and returns to england making the  so strong it survives into the 20th century

many works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function and where the consequences of such reality would not in fact disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history many ambiguous alternate secret histories are set in renaissance or pre renaissance times and may explicitly include a retreat from the world which would explain the current absence of such phenomena
when the magical version of our worlds history is set in contemporary times the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and  using in effect a form of secret history as when s son of darkness has an elf living in new york city in disguise on the other in works such as s magic incorporated where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and poul andersons  and its sequel  where djinns are serious weapons of war—with atomic bombs—the use of magic throughout the united states and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history—although erences in operation chaos to  the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a pod the sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of einstein and planck in 1901 resulting in the theory of rhea tics  applies this theory to degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces this results in the suppression of  and the re emergence of magic and magical creatures
alternate history shades off into other  when the use of actual though altered history and geography decreases although a culture may still be clearly the original source s  and its sequels take place in a  albeit one clearly based on china and with allusions to actual chinese history such as  s  incorporates ancient chinese physics and greek  using them as if factual

alternate history has long been a staple of japanese speculative fiction with such authors as   writing novels set in recognizable historical settings with supernatural or science fiction elements present in 1973 ryo hanmura wrote  which recreated 400 years of japans history from the perspective of a secret magical family with psychic abilities the novel has since come to be recognized as a masterpiece of japanese speculative fiction  twelve years later author  wrote the groundbreaking  which reimagined the history of  across the twentieth century in a world heavily influenced by the supernatural 
the tv show  explores different possible alternate realities by having the protagonist slide into different parallel dimensions of the same planet earth
for the same reasons that this genre is explored by role playing games alternate history is also an intriguing backdrop for the storylines of many s a famous example of an alternate history game is  released in 1996 the game presents a point of divergence in 1946 where  goes back in time to prevent world war ii from ever taking place by erasing  from time after he is released from  in 1924 he is successful in his mission but in the process allows  and the  to become powerful enough to launch a massive campaign to conquer europe
in the  the player guides a civilization from prehistory to the present day creating radically altered versions of history on a long time scale several scenarios recreate a particular period which becomes the point of divergence in an alternate history shaped by the players actions popular examples in  include desert war set in the mediterranean theatre of  and featuring scripted events tied to possible outcomes of battles broken star set in a hypothetical russian civil war in 2010 and  an earth simulator designed to mirror a history as closely as possible but incorporating unpredictable elements to provide realistic alternate settings
in some games such as the  and  series events that were originally intended to represent the near future at the time the games were originally released later ended up becoming alternative histories in later entries in those franchises for example  1990 set in 1999 depicted a near future that ended up becoming an alternative history in  1998 likewise  1996 and  1998 both set in 1998 depicted near future events that had later become an alternative history by the time  2005 was released
in the 2009  shooter  is set on an alternate version of planet earth in the early part of the 20th century after the american  which had spanned over several decades where steam engines replace combustion engines the game sees the protagonists fighting off a rich industrialist who wants to do away with both the union and confederacy in one swift movement and turn the united states of america into a country called the american empire with a totalitarian dictatorship
 is one example of an alternate history spawning multiple interpretations in multiple genres the stories and games in crimson skies take place in an alternate 1930s  where the nation crumbled into many hostile states following the effects of the  the  and  with the road and railway system destroyed commerce took to the skies which led to the emergence of  gangs who plunder the aerial commerce
the game  portrays a situation similar to that of the movie  and red alert 2 though less comically than the latter the point of divergence is during  where the  develops an atomic bomb first and uses it on  with the balance of power and influence tipped in russias favor history diverges brief summaries at the beginning of the game inform the player of the communist blocs complete takeover of europe by 1953 a different ending to the  and the spread of soviet influence into south america and mexico
similarly the 2007 video game  is set in 1989 with the  on the verge of collapse the point of divergence is several months before the opening of the game when  forces staged a desperate invasion of western europe as the game begins a soviet invasion force lands in  taking advantage of the fact that most of the us military is in europe
the game  released in 2008 offered in alternate history campaign for the  wherein japan destroys all three carriers in the  which follows with a successful invasion of the island because of this the united states lacked any sort of aerial power to fight the japanese and is continuously forced into the defense
 released in february 2008 is an alternate history  where  died in 1931 from being hit by a taxi cab because of this  lacks the charismatic leader needed to keep the country together and  successfully conquers great britain via  in 1940 germany later conquers the rest of europe north africa and the  while mass producing their  the  launch a surprise invasion of an isolationist united states  in 1953 which forces the country to surrender and submit to a puppet government
another alternate history game involving nazis is  in which adolf hitler died during the early days of world war ii and thus a much more effective leadership rose to power under the command of a new fuehrer who is erred to as chancellor and his real name is never revealed  succeeds and the nazis successfully conquer britain sparking a cold war between the allied powers and germany
the  of computer role playing games is set in a divergent america where history after world war ii diverges from the real world to follow a  timeline for example  was invented quite soon after the end of the war but the  was either delayed or never was developed the result was a future that has a 1950s world of tomorrow feel to it with extremely high technology such as  implemented with  and other technologies now considered obsolete
many game series by swedish developer  start off at a concise point in history allowing the player to immerse in the role of a contemporary leader and alter the course of in game history the most prominent game with this setting is 
 have an alternative history at  where a special area called the zone is formed
 is set in an alternate 1960 in which the nazis won the second world war also thanks to their acquisition of high technology

an atomic orbital is a  that describes the wave like behavior of either one  or a pair of electrons in an   this function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the  the term may also er to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital 
each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three s   and  which respectively correspond to the electrons   and an angular momentum  the  any orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons each with its own   the simple names s orbital p orbital d orbital and f orbital er to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number  and  respectively these names together with the value ofampnbsp are used to describe the s of atoms they are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal  as sharp principal diffuse and fundamental orbitals for   3 continue alphabetically omittingampnbspj g h i k …   
atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the atomic orbital model alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model a modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter in this model the electron cloud of a multi electron atom may be seen as being built up in approximation in an  that is a product of simpler  atomic orbitals the repeating periodicity of the blocks of 2 6 10 and 14  within sections of the  arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s p d and f atomic orbitals respectively although for higher values of the quantum number  particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge the energies of certain sub shells become very similar and so the  in which they are said to be populated by electrons eg cr   ar4ssup1 sup3dsup5 sup and crsup2+ sup   ar3dsup4 sup can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily
with the development of  and experimental findings such as the two slits diffraction of electrons it was found that the orbiting electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles but needed to be explained by the  in this sense the electrons have the following properties
wave like properties
# the electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the sense of a planet orbiting the sun but instead exist as s the lowest possible energy an electron can take is theore analogous to the fundamental frequency of a wave on a string higher energy states are then similar to  of the 
# the electrons are never in a single point location although the probability of interacting with the electron at a single point can be found from the wave function of the electron
particle like properties
# there is always an integer number of electrons orbiting the nucleus
# electrons jump between orbitals in a particle like fashion for example if a single  strikes the electrons only a single electron changes states in response to the photon
# the electrons retain particle like properties such as each wave state has the same electrical charge as the electron particle each wave state has a single discrete spin spin up or spin down
thus despite the obvious analogy to planets revolving around the sun electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles in addition atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planets elliptical path in ordinary atoms a more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly shaped atmosphere the electron distributed around a relatively tiny planet the atomic nucleus atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this atmosphere only when a single electron is present in an atom when more electrons are added to a single atom the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection sometimes termed the atom’s “electron cloud”  tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing where the atom’s electrons will be found
atomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal  language specifically in quantum mechanics the state of an atom ie an  of the atomic  is approximated by an expansion see  expansion and  into s of anti symmetrized products s of one electron functions the spatial components of these one electron functions are called atomic orbitals when one considers also their  component one speaks of atomic spin orbitals  a state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons so that their motion is correlated but this is often approximated by this  of products of single electron wave functions    the  for example depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons
in  the s correspond to transitions  between s of an atom these states are labeled by a set of s summarized in the  and usually associated with particular electron configurations ie by occupation schemes of atomic orbitals for example 1ssup2 supampnbsp2ssup2 supampnbsp2psup6 sup for the ground state of —term symbol sup1 supssub0 sub
this notation means that the corresponding slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the  expansion the atomic orbital concept is theore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given  for example one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital nevertheless one has to keep in mind that electrons are s ruled by the  and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom moreover it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one determinant wave function at all this is the case when  is large
fundamentally an atomic orbital is a one electron wave function even though most electrons do not exist in one electron atoms and so the one electron view is an approximation when thinking about orbitals we are often given an orbital vision which even if it is not spelled out is heavily influenced by this  approximation which is one way to reduce the complexities of 
atomic orbitals can be the hydrogen like orbitals which are exact solutions to the  for a  ie an atom with one electron alternatively atomic orbitals er to functions that depend on the coordinates of one electron ie orbitals but are used as starting points for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of all the electrons in an atom or molecule the s chosen for atomic orbitals are usually   in atoms and   in polyatomic molecules the advantage of spherical coordinates for atoms is that an orbital wave function is a product of three factors each dependent on a single coordinate 
the angular factors of atomic orbitals Θθ Φφ generate s p d etc functions as  of   where  and  are quantum numbers there are typically three mathematical forms for the radial functionsampnbsp which can be chosen as a starting point for the calculation of the properties of atoms and molecules with many electrons
# the hydrogen like atomic orbitals are derived from the exact solution of the schrödinger equation for one electron and a nucleus for a  the part of the function that depends on the distance from the nucleus has nodes radial nodes and decays as 
# the  sto is a form without radial nodes but  decays from the nucleus as does the hydrogen like orbital
# the form of the  gaussians has no radial nodes and decays as 
although hydrogen like orbitals are still used as pedagogical tools the advent of computers has made stos perable for atoms and diatomic molecules since combinations of stos can replace the nodes in hydrogen like atomic orbital gaussians are typically used in molecules with three or more atoms although not as accurate by themselves as stos combinations of many gaussians can attain the accuracy of hydrogen like orbitals
the term orbital was coined by  in 1932 as an abbreviation for one electron orbital wave function  however the idea that electrons might revolve around a compact nucleus with definite angular momentum was convincingly argued at least 19 years earlier by  name bohr 1913 476  and the japanese physicist  published an orbit based hypothesis for electronic behavior as early as 1904 name nagaoka 1904 445–455 
explaining the behavior of these electron orbits was one of the driving forces behind the development of  
with s discovery of the electron in 1897 name erencec  it became clear that atoms were not the smallest building blocks of nature but were rather composite particles the newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many to imagine how the atoms constituent parts might interact with each other thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolved in orbit like rings within a positively charged jelly like substance  and between the electrons discovery and 1909 this  was the most widely accepted explanation of atomic structure
shortly after thomsons discovery  a japanese physicist predicted a different model for electronic structure name nagaoka 1904 445–455   unlike the plum pudding model the positive charge in nagaokas saturnian model was concentrated into a central core pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of saturns rings few people took notice of nagaokas work at the time 
and nagaoka himself recognized a fundamental defect in the theory even at its conception namely that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is accelerating and theore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation  nevertheless the  turned out to have more in common with modern theory than any of its contemporaries
in 1909  discovered that the bulk of the atomic mass was tightly condensed into a nucleus which was also found to be positively charged it became clear from his analysis in 1911 that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic structure in 1913 as rutherfords post doctoral student  proposed a new model of the atom wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods but were only permitted to have discrete values of angular momentum quantized in units  name bohr 1913 476   this constraint automatically permitted only certain values of electron energies the  of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground state by declaring that there was no state below this and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines
after bohrs use of s explanation of the  to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the  and  of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms the most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines the significance of the bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom this was however not achieved by bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave like properties since the idea that electrons could behave as  was not suggested until eleven years later still the bohr models use of quantized angular momenta and theore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms and also a significant step towards the development of  in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms
with s suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924 and for a short time before the full 1926  treatment of  a bohr electron wavelength could be seen to be a function of its momentum and thus a bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half wavelength this physically incorrect bohr model is still often taught to beginning students the bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the wavelength argument however this period was immediately superseded by the full three dimensional wave mechanics of 1926 in our current understanding of physics the bohr model is called a semi classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the bohr model was proposed
the bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of  the energies of electrons in the n   1 2 3 etc states in the bohr model match those of current physics however this did not explain similarities between different atoms as expressed by the periodic table such as the fact that  two electrons neon 10 electrons and  18 electrons exhibit similar chemical inertness modern  explains this in terms of s and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the  thus the n   1 state can hold one or two electrons while the n   2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells in helium all n   1 states are fully occupied the same for n   1 and n   2 in neon in argon the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom and remains empty
immediately after  discovered his  
it was noted by  that the existence of any sort of  implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself 
in quantum mechanics where all particle momenta are associated with waves it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave and thus the particle in space in states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound it must be localized as a wave packet and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength and thus also momentum and energy in quantum mechanics as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta and thus larger kinetic energy thus the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the region of space grows smaller particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space since this would require an infinite particle momentum
in chemistry    and others noted that the consequence of heisenbergs relation was that the electron as a wave packet could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital  suggested that the electrons position needed to be described by a  which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave function which described its associated wave packet the new quantum mechanics did not give exact results but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it as we cannot with electrons in an atom
in the quantum picture of heisenberg schrödinger and others the bohr atom numberampnbspn for each orbital became known as an n sphere in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electrons wave packet which surrounded the atom
orbitals are given names in the form
mathx \ \mathrm{type}^y \  math
where x is the energy level corresponding to the   type is a lower case letter denoting the shape or  of the orbital and it corresponds to the ampnbsp and  is the number of electrons in that orbital
for example the orbital 1ssup2 sup pronounced one ess two has two electrons and is the lowest energy level  and has an angular quantum number of  in  the principal quantum number is given a letter associated with it for  the letters associated with those numbers are k l m n o … respectively
the simplest atomic orbitals are those that are calculated for systems with a single electron such as the  an atom of any other element ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen and the orbitals take the same form in the schrödinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle the atomic orbitals are the  of the  for the energy they can be obtained analytically meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series and exponential and trigonometric functions see 
for atoms with two or more electrons the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation orbitals of multi electron atoms are qualitatively similar to those of hydrogen and in the simplest models they are taken to have the same form for more rigorous and precise analysis the numerical approximations must be used
a given hydrogen like atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers   and  the rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers and their energies see below explain the electron configuration of the atoms and the 
the stationary states s of the hydrogen like atoms are its atomic orbitals however in general an electrons behavior is not fully described by a single orbital electron states are best represented by time depending mixtures s of multiple orbitals see 
the quantum number  first appeared in the  where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit in modern quantum mechanics however  determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus all electrons with the same value of n lie at the same average distance for this reason orbitals with the same value of n are said to comprise a  orbitals with the same value of n and also the same value ofampnbsp are even more closely related and are said to comprise a 
because of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus atomic orbitals can be uniquely defined by a set of integers known as quantum numbers these quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex versions of the atomic orbitals are employed
in physics the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic the quantum numbers together with the rules governing their possible values are as follows
the   describes the energy of the electron and is always a  in fact it can be any positive integer but for reasons discussed below large numbers are seldom encountered each atom has in general many orbitals associated with each value of n these orbitals together are sometimes called 
the   describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non negative integer within a shell where  is some integer   ranges across all integer values satisfying the relation math0 \le \ell \le n_0 1 math for instance the ampnbspshell has only orbitals with math\ell 0 math and the ampnbspshell has only orbitals with math\ell 0 math and math\ell 1 math the set of orbitals associated with a particular value ofampnbsp are sometimes collectively called a subshell
the  mathm_\ell math describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction and is also always an integer within a subshell where math\ell math is some integer math\ell_0 math mathm_\ell math ranges thus math \ell_0 \le m_\ell \le \ell_0 math
the above results may be summarized in the following table each cell represents a subshell and lists the values of mathm_\ell math available in that subshell empty cells represent subshells that do not exist

subshells are usually identified by their mathn math  and math\ell math values mathn math is represented by its numerical value but math\ell math is represented by a letter as follows 0 is represented by s 1 by p 2 by d 3 by f and 4 by g for instance one may speak of the subshell with mathn 2 math and math\ell 0 math as a 2s subshell
each electron also has a  s which describes the spin of each electron spin up or spin down the number s can be + or −
the  states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state every electron in an atom must have a unique combination of quantum numbers
the above conventions imply a perred axis for example the z direction in cartesian coordinates and they also imply a perred direction along this perred axis otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing  from  as such the model is most useful when applied to physical systems that share these symmetries the  — where an atom is exposed to a magnetic field — provides one such example 
an atom that is embedded in a crystalline solid feels multiple perred axes but no perred direction instead of building atomic orbitals out of the product of radial functions and a single  linear combinations of spherical harmonics are typically used designed so that the imaginary part of the spherical harmonics cancel out these real orbitals are the building blocks most commonly shown in orbital visualizations
in the real hydrogen like orbitals for example  and  have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts but  is no longer a good quantum number though its absolute value is the orbitals are given new names based on their shape with respect to a standardized cartesian basis the real hydrogen like pampnbsporbitals are given by the following name levine7ed  
mathp_z   p_0 math
mathp_x   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \leftp_1 + p_{ 1} \right  math
mathp_y   \frac{1}{i\sqrt{2}} \left p_1   p_{ 1} \right  math
where   and  are the complex orbitals corresponding to 
the equations for the psubx sub and psuby sub orbitals depend on the phase convention used for the spherical harmonics the above equations suppose that the spherical harmonics are defined by math y_\ell^m \theta \varphi    n e^{i m \varphi } p_\ell^m \cos{\theta}  math however some quantum physicists   include a phase factor  1supm sup in these definitions which has the effect of relating the psubx sub orbital to a difference of spherical harmonics and the psuby sub orbital to the corresponding sum for more detail see 
simple pictures showing orbital shapes are intended to describe the angular forms of regions in space where the electrons occupying the orbital are likely to be found the diagrams cannot however show the entire region where an electron can be found since according to quantum mechanics there is a non zero probability of finding the electron almost anywhere in space instead the diagrams are approximate representations of boundary or  where the probability density  has a constant value chosen so that there is a certain probability for example 90% of finding the electron within the contour although  as the square of an  is everywhere non negative the sign of the   is often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture
sometimes the  function will be graphed to show its phases rather than the  which shows probability density but has no phases which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value since  is a complex number  orbital graphs tend to have less spherical thinner lobes than  graphs but have the same number of lobes in the same places and otherwise are recognizable this article in order to show wave function phases shows mostly  graphs
the lobes can be viewed as  patterns between the two counter rotating  and  modes with the projection of the orbital onto the xy plane having a resonant  wavelengths around the circumference for each  there are two of these  and  for the case where  the orbital is vertical counter rotating information is unknown and the orbital is z axis symmetric for the case where  there are no counter rotating modes  there are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric  for any given  the smaller  is the more radial nodes there are  loosely speaking n is energy  is analogous to  and  is orientation
generally speaking the number  determines the size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus as  increases the size of the orbital increases however in comparing different elements the higher nuclear charge  of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones so that the overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant even as the number of electrons in heavier elements higher  increases
also in general terms  determines an orbitals shape and  its orientation however since some orbitals are described by equations in s the shape sometimes depends on  also together the whole set of orbitals for a given  and  fill space as symmetrically as possible though with increasingly complex sets of lobes and nodes
the single s orbitals math\ell 0 math are shaped like spheres for  it is roughly a  it is most dense at the center and fades exponentially outwardly but for  or more each single s orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells ie the wave structure is radial following a sinusoidal radial component as well see illustration of a cross section of these nested shells at right the s orbitals for all  numbers are the only orbitals with an anti node a region of high wave function density at the center of the nucleus all other orbitals p d f etc have angular momentum and thus avoid the nucleus having a wave node at the nucleus
the three p orbitals for  have the form of two s with a  at the  the two lobed shape is sometimes erred to as a —there are two lobes pointing in opposite directions from each other the three p orbitals in each  are oriented at right angles to each other as determined by their respective linear combination of values ofampnbsp the overall result is a lobe pointing along each direction of the primary axes
four of the five d orbitals for  look similar each with four pear shaped lobes each lobe tangent at right angles to two others and the centers of all four lying in one plane three of these planes are the xy  xz  and yz planes—the lobes are between the pairs of primary axes—and the fourth has the centres along the x and y axes themselves the fifth and final d orbital consists of three regions of high probability density a  with two pear shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis the overall total of 18 directional lobes point in every primary axis direction and between every pair
there are seven f orbitals each with shapes more complex than those of the d orbitals
additionally as is the case with the s orbitals individual p d f and g orbitals with  values higher than the lowest possible value exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type as compared with the lowest or fundamental mode of the wave as with s orbitals this phenomenon provides p d f and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of  for example 3p orbitals vs the fundamental 2p an additional node in each lobe still higher values of  further increase the number of radial nodes for each type of orbital
the shapes of atomic orbitals in one electron atom are related to 3 dimensional  these shapes are not unique and any linear combination is valid like a transformation to s in fact it is possible to generate sets where all the ds are the same shape just like the  and  are the same shape  
this table shows all orbital configurations for the real hydrogen like wave functions up to 7s and theore covers the simple electronic configuration for all elements in the periodic table up to  ψ graphs are shown with − and +  phases shown in two different colors arbitrarily red and blue the  orbital is the same as the  orbital but the  and  are formed by taking linear
combinations of the  and  orbitals which is why they are listed under the  label also the  and  are not
the same shape as the  since they are pure

the shapes of atomic orbitals can be understood qualitatively by considering the analogous case of   to see the analogy the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles a measure of average drum membrane velocity and momentum at that point must be considered relative to that points distance from the center of the drum head if this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals the basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be that is the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electrons average momentum at that point since high electron momentum at a given position tends to localize the electron in that position via the properties of electron wave packets see the  for details of the mechanism
this relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals for example in all of the modes analogous to sampnbsporbitals the top row in the animated illustration below it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly corresponding to the  in all sampnbsporbitals in an atom this antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it since it is moving on average most rapidly at that point giving it maximal momentum
a mental planetary orbit picture closest to the behavior of electrons in sampnbsporbitals all of which have no angular momentum might perhaps be that of a  with the  of 1 but a finite major axis not physically possible because s were to collide but can be imagined as a  of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity   could somebody make an illustration   
below a number of drum membrane vibration modes are shown the analogous wave functions of the hydrogen atom are indicated a correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two coordinate system  and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three coordinate

none of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode and in all of them the center of the drum does not move these correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non s orbitals in an atom these orbitals all have some angular momentum and in the planetary model they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 10 so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body but keep somewhat away from it
in addition the drum modes analogous to p and d modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum whereas all of the modes analogous to sampnbspmodes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction the non radial symmetry properties of non s orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum for these modes waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons

in atoms with a single electron s the energy of an orbital and consequently of any electrons in the orbital is determined exclusively by mathn math the mathn 1 math orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom each successively higher value of mathn math has a higher level of energy but the difference decreases as mathn math increases for high mathn math the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom in single electron atoms all levels with different math\ell math within a given mathn math are to a good approximation degenerate and have the same energy this approximation is broken to a slight extent by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and by  effects the latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for sampnbspelectrons that go nearer the nucleus since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge even in one electron atoms see 
in atoms with multiple electrons the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital but also on its interactions with the other electrons these interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution and so the s of orbitals depend not only on mathn math but also on math\ell math higher values of math\ell math are associated with higher values of energy for instance the 2p state is higher than the 2s state when math\ell   2 math the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the s orbital in the next higher shell when math\ell   3 math the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher the filling of the 3d orbitals does not occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled
the increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron–electron interaction effects and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons thus in atoms of higher atomic number the math\ell math of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy and the principal quantum numbers mathn math of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement
the energy sequence of the first 35ampnbspsubshells eg 1s 2p 3d etc is given in the following table each cell represents a subshell with mathn math and math\ell math given by its row and column indices respectively the number in the cell is the subshells position in the sequence for a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms see the section below

note empty cells indicate non existent sublevels while numbers in italics indicate sublevels that could potentially exist but which do not hold electrons in any element currently known
several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals  the first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers this is the  these quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals as well as  or  thus two electrons may occupy a single orbital so long as they have different values ofampnbsp however only two electrons because of their spin can be associated with each orbital
additionally an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state it is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the pauli exclusion principle but if lower energy orbitals are available this condition is unstable the electron will eventually lose energy by releasing a  and drop into the lower orbital thus electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above
this behavior is responsible for the structure of the  the table may be divided into several rows called periods numbered starting with 1 at the top the presently known elements occupy seven periods if a certain period has number i it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the ith shell  was the first to propose 1923 that the  in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels resulting in the electronic structure of the atom name bohr 
the periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular  the elements belonging to a given block have this common feature their highest energy electrons all belong to the same  state but the  associated with that  state depends upon the period for instance the leftmost two columns constitute the s block the outermost electrons of  and  respectively belong to the 2sampnbspsubshell and those of  and  to the 3sampnbspsubshell
the following is the order for filling the subshell orbitals which also gives the order of the blocks in the periodic table
1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s 5f 6d 7p
the periodic nature of the filling of orbitals as well as emergence of the s p d and f blocks is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows periods in the matrix then each subshell composed of the first two quantum numbers is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain the result is a compressed periodic table with each entry representing two successive elements

although this is the general order of orbital filling according to the madelung rule there are exceptions and the actual electronic energies of each element are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms see 
the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the  the electrons in the outermost shell or s tend to be responsible for an elements chemical behavior elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties
for elements with high atomic number  the effects of relativity become more pronounced and especially so for sampnbspelectrons which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high  atoms this relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals by comparison to corresponding s and d electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy
examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of  which results from 6s electrons not being available for metal bonding and the golden color of  and  which results from narrowing of 6s to 5d transition energy to the point that visible light begins to be absorbed 
in the  an ampnbspelectron has a velocity given by mathv   z \alpha c math where  is the atomic number math\alpha math is the  and  is the speed of light in non relativistic quantum mechanics theore any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light even in the  which accounts for relativistic effects the wavefunction of the electron for atoms with  is oscillatory and  the significance of element 137 also known as  was first pointed out by the physicist  element 137 is sometimes informally called  symbol fy  however feynmans approximation fails to predict the exact critical value ofampnbsp due to the non point charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than  the critical ampnbspvalue which makes the atom unstable with regard to high field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron positron pairs does not occur until  is about 173 these conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators where such electron positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed see 
there are no nodes in relativistic orbital densities although individual components of the wavefunction will have nodes 
bound quantum states have discrete energy levels when applied to atomic orbitals this means that the energy differences between states are also discrete a transition between these states ie an electron absorbing or emitting a photon can thus only happen if the photon has an energy corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states
consider two states of the hydrogen atom
state 1    and 
state 2    and 
by quantum theory stateampnbsp1 has a fixed energy of  and stateampnbsp2 has a fixed energy of  now what would happen if an electron in stateampnbsp1 were to move to stateampnbsp2 for this to happen the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly  if the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value it cannot jump from stateampnbsp1 to stateampnbsp2 now suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad spectrum of light photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly  will be absorbed by the electron in stateampnbsp1 and that electron will jump to stateampnbsp2 however photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals it cannot jump to a state between orbitals the result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom this creates a line in the spectrum known as an absorption line which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2
the atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra which are observed experimentally this is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model
the atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory which only recognizes many electron states the predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron

amino acids are  important s containing   nhsub2 sub and   cooh s usually along with a  specific to each amino     the key elements of an amino acid are    and  though other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids about 500 amino acids are known and can be classified in many ways  they can be classified according to the core structural functional groups locations as  amino acids other categories relate to   level and side chain group type    containing hydroxyl or  etc in the form of s amino acids comprise the second largest component water is the largest of human s  and other   outside proteins amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as  transport and 
in  amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the  atom have particular importance they are known as 2  alpha  or α amino acids generic  hsub2 subnchrcooh in most cases is an exception to this general formula it lacks the nhsub2 sub group because of the  of the side chain and is known as an  it falls under the category of special structured amino acids  where r is an   known as a   often the term amino acid is used to er specifically to these they include the 23  protein building amino acids

many important proteinogenic and non proteinogenic amino acids also play critical non protein roles within the body for example in the  glutamate standard  and  gaba non standard gamma amino acid are respectively the main  name pmid12467378   a major component of the   is synthesised from  the standard amino acid  is used to synthesise porphyrins used in s and the non standard  is used in 
nine proteinogenic amino acids are called  for humans because they cannot be created from other  by the human body and so must be taken in as food others may be  for certain ages or medical conditions essential amino acids may also differ between for example s such as cows obtain a number of amino acids via s in the  
because of their biological significance amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in s s and  industrial uses include the production of  s and 
the first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century in 1806 french chemists  and  isolated a compound in  that was subsequently named  the first amino acid to be discovered  name anfinsen   was discovered in 1810  although its monomer  remained undiscovered until 1884 name anfinsen    and  were discovered in 1820   the last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was  in 1935 by  who also determined the s and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth  
usage of the term amino acid in the english language is from 1898  proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid  in 1902  and  proposed that proteins are the result of the formation of bonds between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another in a linear structure that fischer termed  
in the structure shown at the top of the page r represents a  specific to each amino acid the  atom next to the  which is theore numbered 2 in the  starting from that functional group is called the   amino acids containing an  bonded directly to the alpha carbon are erred to as alpha amino acids   these include amino acids such as  which contain s which formerly were often erred to as imino acids http  opbsokstateedu 5753 amino%20acidshtml  name goldbook 
the alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature but only when occurring in the l isomer  the alpha carbon is a  carbon atom with the exception of  which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon name creighton   theore all alpha amino acids but  can exist in either of two  called smalll small or smalld small amino acids which are mirror images of each other see also  while smalll small amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in s during translation in the ribosome smalld small amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme s after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum as in exotic sea dwelling organisms such as s  they are also abundant components of the  s of bacteria  and smalld small serine may act as a  in the brain  smalld small amino acids are used in  to create centrosymmetric crystals which depending on the protein may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination  the smalll small and smalld small convention for amino acid configuration ers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of  from which that amino acid can in theory be synthesized smalld small glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory smalll small glyceraldehyde is levorotatory
in alternative fashion the  are used to indicate the absolute  almost all of the amino acids in proteins are s at the α carbon with cysteine being r and glycine non chiral  cysteine is unusual since it has a  atom at the second position in its side chain which has a larger  z than the groups attached to the first carbon which is attached to the α carbon in the other standard amino acids thus the r instead of s
in amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the α–carbon such as  shown to the right the carbons are labeled in order as α β γ δ and so on  in some amino acids the amine group is attached to the β or γ carbon and these are theore erred to as beta or gamma amino acids
amino acids are usually classified by the  of their side chain into four groups the side chain can make an amino acid a  or a  and a  if the side chain is  or a  if it is  name creighton   the s of the 22 standard amino acids along with their chemical properties are described more fully in the article on these s
the phrase  or bcaa ers to the amino acids having  side chains that are non linear these are   and   is the only  amino acid whose side group links to the α amino group and thus is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position name creighton   in chemical terms proline is theore an  since it lacks a   although it is still classed as an amino acid in the current biochemical nomenclature  and may also be called an n alkylated alpha amino acid 
the α  group of amino acids is a  meaning that it releases a  such as a  at moderate ph values  in other words carboxylic acid groups −cosub2 subh can be  to become negative s −cosub2 subsup− sup   the negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at ph values greater than the  of the carboxylic acid group mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 22 see the table of amino acid structures above  in a complementary fashion the α  of amino acids is a  meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate ph values  in other words α amino groups nhsub2 sub− can be  to become positive α ammonium groups sup+ supnhsub3 sub−  the positively charged α ammonium group predominates at ph values less than the pka of the α ammonium group mean for the 20 common α amino acids is about 94
because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups they share  properties name creighton    below ph 22 the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α ammonium ion net charge +1 and above ph 94 a negative carboxylate and neutral α amino group net charge −1  but at ph between 22 and 94 an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive α ammonium group as shown in structure 2 on the right so has net zero charge  this molecular state is known as a  from the german zwitter meaning hermaphrodite or hybrid   the fully neutral form structure 1 on the right is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the ph range less than 1 part in 10sup7 sup amino acids exist as zwitterions also in the solid phase and crystallize with salt like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines
the variation in titration curves when the amino acids are grouped by category can be seen here with the exception of tyrosine using titration to differentiate between hydrophobic amino acids is problematic
at ph values between the two pka values the zwitterion predominates but coexists in  with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions at the exact midpoint between the two pka values the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance so that average net charge of all forms present is zero  this ph is known as the  pi so pi   ½pkasub1 sub + pkasub2 sub the individual amino acids all have slightly different pka values so have different isoelectric points for amino acids with charged side chains the pka of the side chain is involved thus for asp glu with negative side chains pi   ½pkasub1 sub + pkasubr sub where pkasubr sub is the side chain pka cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pkasubr sub   814 so pi should be calculated as for asp and glu even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral ph for his lys and arg with positive side chains pi   ½pkasubr sub + pkasub2 sub amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids in particular with non polar side chains can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the ph to the required isoelectric point
amino acids are the structural units monomers that make up proteins they join together to form short  chains called s or longer chains called either  or s these polymers are linear and unbranched with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids the process of making proteins is called  and involves the step by step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a  that is called a   the order in which the amino acids are added is read through the  from an  template which is a  copy of one of the organisms s
twenty two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called  or natural amino acids name creighton   of these 20 are encoded by the universal  the remaining 2  and  are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms  is incorporated when the mrna being translated includes a  which causes the uga codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a    is used by some ic  in enzymes that they use to produce  it is coded for with the codon uag which is normally a stop codon in other organisms  this uag codon is followed by a  name pmid16164991 
aside from the 22 s there are many other amino acids that are called non proteinogenic those either are not found in proteins for example   or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery for example  and 
non proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by  which is modification after translation during protein synthesis these modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein for example the  of  allows for better binding of   and the  of  is critical for maintaining   another example is the formation of  in the   through modification of a lysine residue  such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein eg the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a  membrane 
some non proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins examples include    and the neurotransmitter  non proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the s for standard amino acidsampnbsp– for example  and  occur in the  part of amino acid  see below  a rare exception to the dominance of α amino acids in biology is the β amino acid  3 aminopropanoic acid which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of  vitamin bsub5 sub a component of  
the 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal  are called standard or canonical amino acids the others are called non standard or non canonical most of the non standard amino acids are also non proteinogenic ie they cannot be used to build proteins but three of them are proteinogenic as they can be used to build proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code
the three non standard proteinogenic amino acids are  present in many noneukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes but not coded directly by dna  found only in some  and one  and  which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts for example 25 human proteins include selenocysteine sec in their primary structure  and the structurally characterized enzymes selenoenzymes employ sec as the catalytic  in their active sitesgromer s urig s becker k 2004 the thioredoxin system – from science to clinic medicinal research reviews 24140–89  pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons for example selenocysteine is encoded by  and  name booksgooglecom  name vojw6fiisskc p299  name url_the_genetic_codes_ncbi  
when taken up into the human body from the diet the 22 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to  and  as a source of energy  the oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a  the amino group is then fed into the  the other product of transamidation is a  that enters the   s can also be converted into glucose through  
pyrrolysine trait is restricted to several microbes and only one organism has both pyl and sec of the 22 standard amino acids 9 are called s because the  cannot  them from other  at the level needed for normal growth so they must be obtained from food  in addition    and  are considered semiessential amino acids in children though taurine is not technically an amino acid because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed   the amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids dietary exposure to the non standard amino acid bmaa has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases including als name holtcamp

however not all of the functions of other abundant non standard amino acids are known
some non standard amino acids are used as  in plants name hylin1969  for example  is an analogue of  that is found in many s name turner1967  and in particularly large amounts in  sword bean  this amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing  the non protein amino acid  is found in other species of legume in particular   this compound is an analogue of  and can poison animals that graze on these plants
amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry but their main use is as additives to  this is necessary since many of the bulk components of these feeds such as s either have low levels or lack some of the s lysine methionine threonine and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds name leuchtenberger2005  in this industry amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals

since 2001 40 non natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon recoding and a corresponding transfer rnaaminoacylampnbsp– trna synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring  and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins name pmid16260173  name pmid19318213 
nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid however in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another for example bacteria per to use cga instead of aga to code for arginine  this creates some sequences that do not appear in the genome  this characteristic can be taken advantage of and used to create new selective cancer fighting drugs  and to prevent cross contamination of dna samples from crime scene investigations 
amino acids are important as low cost s these compounds are used in  as  building blocks name hanessian1993 
amino acids have been investigated as precursors s eg for asymmetric  reactions although no commercial applications exist name blaser1992 
amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers these materials have applications as  packaging and in medicine in  and the construction of  these polymers include polypeptides s polyesters polysulfides and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains these modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers name sanda1999  an interesting example of such materials is  a water soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable s and agriculture name gross2002  due to its solubility and ability to  metal ions polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti  agent and a   name thombre2005  in addition the aromatic amino acid  is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic  such as  in the manufacture of s name bourke2003 
as amino acids have both a primary  group and a primary  group these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups these include   formation and  for the amine group and   formation and  for the carboxylic acid group  the combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal amino acid chelates 
the multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions  the types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side chains and are theore different between the various types of amino acid
several methods exist to synthesize amino acids one of the oldest methods begins with the  at the α carbon of a carboxylic acid nucleophilic substitution with  then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid  in alternative fashion the  involves the treatment of an aldehyde with  and ammonia this produces an α amino nitrile as an intermediate hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α amino acid  using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids  likewise using s instead of aldehydes gives αα disubstituted amino acids  the classical synthesis gives s of α amino acids as products but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries  or asymmetric catalysts   have been developed 
at the current time the most adopted method is an  synthesis on a solid support eg  beads using s eg  and  and activating groups eg  and 
as both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage this  of amino acids is what creates proteins this  yields the newly formed  and a molecule of water in cells this reaction does not occur directly instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a  molecule through an  bond this aminoacyl trna is produced in an  dependent reaction carried out by an   this aminoacyl trna is then a substrate for the  which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond  as a result of this mechanism all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their n terminus and moving toward their c terminus
however not all peptide bonds are formed in this way in a few cases peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes for example the tripeptide  is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress this peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids  in the first step  condenses  and  through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate the gamma carbon of this side chain and the amino group of the cysteine this dipeptide is then condensed with  by  to form glutathione 
in chemistry peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions one of the most used in  uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units these are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain which is attached to a solid resin support  the ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids using  has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through  
in plants nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of  formed from alpha ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion in order to form other amino acids the plant uses s to move the amino group to another alpha keto carboxylic acid for example aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha ketoglutarate and aspartate  other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis too
nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids for example  is formed through the  or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite  name brosnan  while  is made by a  of  
s and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids for example some microbes make  and  which is a sulfide bridged derivative of alanine both of these amino acids are found in peptidic  such as   however in plants  is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone  
amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via s since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized degradation of an amino acid occurring in the liver and kidneys often involves  by moving its amino group to alpha ketoglutarate forming  this process involves transaminases often the same as those used in amination during synthesis in many vertebrates the amino group is then removed through the  and is excreted in the form of  however amino acid degradation can produce  or ammonia instead for example  converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia  after removal of one or more amino groups the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids or it can be used for energy by entering  or the  as detailed in image at right
the 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties important factors are charge  or  size and functional groups name creighton   these properties are important for  and s the water soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues leu ile val phe and trp buried in the middle of the protein whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent note that in  a residue ers to a specific  within the  of a   or  the s tend to have outer rings of exposed  amino acids that anchor them into the  in the case part way between these two extremes some s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane in similar fashion proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like  and  while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like  and  there are different s of amino acid residues 
some amino acids have special properties such as  that can form covalent s to other cysteine residues  that forms  to the polypeptide backbone and  that is more flexible than other amino acids
many proteins undergo a range of s when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins some modifications can produce hydrophobic s  or hydrophilic s  these type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane for example the addition and removal of the fatty acid  to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes

turings fathers civil service commission was still active and during turings childhood years turings parents travelled between  in england  and india leaving their two sons to stay with a retired  couple at hastings turing stayed at baston lodge upper maze hill  now marked with a blue plaque 
very early in life turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently name toolbox  his parents purchased a house in  in 1927 and turing lived there during school holidays the location is also marked with a blue plaque 
turings parents enrolled him at st michaels a day school at 20 charles road  at the age of six the headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators in 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to  an independent school in the  of  in dorset the first day of term coincided with the  in britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied more than  from  to sherborne stopping overnight at an inn name metamagical 
turings natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the  his headmaster wrote to his parents i hope he will not fall between two stools if he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated if he is to be solely a scientific specialist he is wasting his time at a public school  despite this turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary  in 1928 aged 16 turing encountered s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce einsteins questioning of  from a text in which this was never made explicit 
at sherborne turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil christopher morcom who has been described as turings first love their relationship provided inspiration in turings future endeavours but it was cut short by morcoms death in february 1930 from complications of  contracted after drinking infected cows milk some years previously name nyreviewbooks rachel hassall http  oldshirburnianorguk wp content uploads 2014 03 the sherborne formula vivat 2012 2013 optimisedpdf the sherborne formula the making of alan turing vivat 2012 13  name teuscher 
 
the event caused turing great sorrow he coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with morcom in a letter to morcoms mother turing saidblockquotei am sure i could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited i regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and i think he felt a little the same about meampnbsp i know i must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do  blockquote
some have speculated that morcoms death was the cause of turings  and paul gray http  wwwtimecom time magazine article 0917199062400html alan turing time magazines most important people of the century p2  but this seems unlikely apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death in a later letter also written to morcoms mother turing said blockquotepersonally i believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of bodyampnbsp as regards the actual connection between spirit and body i consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected when the body is asleep i cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately  blockquote
after sherborne turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at  whence he gained first class honours in mathematics in 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a  of kings on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the see section 3 of john aldrich england and continental probability in the inter war years journal electronique dhistoire des probabilités et de la statistique vol 5 2 http  wwwjehpsnet decembre2009html decembre 2009 journal electronique dhistoire des probabilités et de la statistique  despite the fact that the committee had failed to identify that it had already been proven in 1922 by  
in 1928 german mathematician  had called attention to the  decision problem in his paper on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem submitted on 28 may 1936 and delivered 12 november  turing ormulated s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing gödels universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as s he proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an  he went on to prove that there was no solution to the  by first showing that the  for turing machines is  in general it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given turing machine will ever halt
although turings proof was published shortly after s equivalent proof  using his  turings approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than churchs it also included a notion of a universal machine now known as a  with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could churchs lambda calculus according to the  turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable  acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to turings papervon neumannampnbsp firmly emphasised to me and to others i am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to turing—insofar as not anticipated by babbage lovelace and others letter by  to  1972 quoted in  2004 the essential turing p22  to this day turing machines are a central object of study in 
from september 1936 to july 1938 turing spent most of his time studying under church at  in addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier  in june 1938 he obtained his phd from princeton  his dissertation  name turingphd   introduced the concept of  and the notion of  where turing machines are augmented with so called  allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved by a turing machine
when turing returned to cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by  about the   remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from turing and other students from students notesed  wittgensteins lectures on the foundations of mathematics university of chicago press 1976  turing and wittgenstein argued and disagreed with turing defending  and wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them 
during the second world war turing was a leading participant in the breaking of german ciphers at bletchley park the historian and wartime codebreaker  has said you needed exceptional talent you needed genius at bletchley and turings was that genius 
from september 1938 turing had been working part time with the  the british code breaking organisation he concentrated on  with  a senior gcampcs codebreaker colossus and the dawning of the computer age p 352 in action this day 2001  soon after the july 1939  meeting at which the  had provided the british and french with the details of the wiring of  and their method of decrypting  messages turing and knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem  the polish method relied on an insecure  procedure that the germans were likely to change which they did in may 1940 turings approach was more general using  for which he produced the functional specification of the  an improvement of the polish  
on 4 september 1939 the day after the uk declared war on germany turing reported to bletchley park the wartime station of gcampcs name copeland2006p378copeland 2006 p 378 
specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that turing made during the war the others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the german navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed  developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the  tunny dubbed  and towards the end of the war the development of a portable  scrambler at  that was codenamed delilah
by using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process turing made an innovative contribution to the subject he wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches which were entitled the applications of probability to cryptography  and paper on statistics of repetitions  which were of such value to gcampcs and its successor  that they were not released to the  until april 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth a gchq mathematician said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance 
turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at bletchley park he was known to his colleagues as prof and his treatise on enigma was known as the profs book   a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by  as having said of turing
while working at bletchley turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the  to london when he was needed for high level meetings  and he was capable of world class marathon standards   turing tried out for the 1948 british olympic team hampered by an injury  his tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than british silver medalist thomas richards olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes  he was walton athletic clubs best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone   
in 1945 turing was awarded the  by king  for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years 
within weeks of arriving at bletchley park name copeland2006p378   turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break enigma more effectively than the polish  from which its name was derived the bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician  became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack enigma enciphered messages
jack good opined
the bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an enigma message ie rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable  a fragment of probable  for each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10sup19 sup states or 10sup22 sup states for the four rotor u boat variantprofessor jack good in the men who cracked enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct  the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electrically the bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail the first bombe was installed on 18 march 1940 
by late 1941 turing and his fellow cryptanalysts gordon welchman  and  were frustrated building on the  they had set up a good working system for decrypting enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals in the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of german adjustments they had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere finally breaking all the rules on 28 october they wrote directly to  spelling out their difficulties with turing as the first named they emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces 
as  biographer of turing later wrote this letter had an electric effect name hodges 1983 221  churchill wrote a memo to  which read action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done on 18 november the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken name hodges 1983 221  the cryptographers at bletchley park did not know of the prime ministers response but as milner barry later recalled all that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smoothcopeland the essential turing http  wwwmathsedacuk ~aar turingletterpdf pp 336–337  more than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war name codebreaker 
turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of  because no one else was doing anything about it and i could have it to myself name mahonp14  in december 1939 turing solved the essential part of the naval  system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services name mahonp14    that same night he also conceived of the idea of  a sequential statistical technique what  later called  to assist in breaking naval enigma though i was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken  name mahonp14   for this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the  banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes
in 1941 turing proposed marriage to hut 8 colleague  a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived after admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage 
turing travelled to the united states in november 1942  and worked with us navy cryptanalysts on naval enigma and bombe construction in washington he also visited their  in dayton ohio his reaction to the american bombe design was far from enthusiastic
during this trip he also assisted at  with the development of  devices  he returned to bletchley park in march 1943 during his absence  had officially assumed the position of head of hut 8 although alexander had been de facto head for some time turing had little interest in the day to day running of the section turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at bletchley park
alexander wrote as follows about his contribution
in july 1942 turing devised a technique termed  or jokingly turingismus  for use against the  messages produced by the germans new geheimschreiber secret writer machine this was a   codenamed tunny at bletchley park turingery was a method of wheel breaking ie a procedure for working out the cam settings of tunnys wheels  he also introduced the tunny team to  who under the guidance of  went on to build the  the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the  and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages  some have mistakenly said that turing was a key figure in the design of the colossus computer turingery and the statistical approach of banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about    but he was not directly involved in the colossus development 
following his work at bell labs in the us  turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the secret services radio security service later  at  there he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer donald bayley together they undertook the design and construction of a portable  communications machine codenamed delilah  it was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case delilah was completed too late to be used during the war though the system worked fully with turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a  speech delilah was not adopted for use 
turing also consulted with bell labs on the development of  a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war
from 1945 to 1947 turing lived in   while he worked on the design of the  automatic computing engine at the  he presented a paper on 19 february 1946 which was the first detailed design of a   s incomplete  had predated turings paper but it was much less detailed and according to  superintendent of the npl mathematics division it contains a number of ideas which are dr turings own citing   although ace was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at bletchley park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned in late 1947 he returned to cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on intelligent machinery that was not published in his lifetimesee   while he was at cambridge the  was being built in his absence it executed its first program on 10 may 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the  and the american  the full version of turings ace was not built until after his death 
according to the memoirs of the german computer pioneer  from the  published by genscher düsseldorf there was a meeting between alan turing and   it took place in  in 1947 the interrogation had the form of a colloquium participants were  turing porter from england and a few german researchers like zuse walther and billing for more details see herbert bruderer konrad zuse und die schweiz
in 1948 turing was appointed  in the  at the  in 1949 he became deputy director of the computing laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest  computers—the  during this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics name doi101093 qjmam 11287  and in   october 1950 turing addressed the problem of  and proposed an experiment which became known as the  an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent the idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being 2008 http  eprintsecssotonacuk 7741 the annotation game on turing 1950 on computing machinery and intelligence in epstein robert amp peters grace eds parsing the turing test philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer springer  in the paper turing suggested that rather than building a programme to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a childs mind and then to subject it to a course of education a  form of the turing test is widely used on the internet the  test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer
in 1948 turing working with his former undergraduate colleague  began writing a  program for a computer that did not yet exist by 1950 the programme was completed and dubbed the turochamp  in 1952 he tried to implement it on a  but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the programme instead turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move the game was recordedhttp  wwwchessgamescom perl chessgamegid 1356927 alan turing vs alick glennie 1952 turing test chessgamescom  the program lost to turings colleague  although it is said that it won a game against champernownes wife
his turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century 
he also invented the  method in 1948 name doi101093 qjmam 11287  used today for solving matrix equations 
towards the end of his life turing turned to  publishing the  in 1952 he was interested in  the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms his central interest in the field was understanding fibonacci  the existence of  in plant structures  he suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a  could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis  instability in the system of   used to model the system allows for small random perturbations to homogeneous initial state to drive the development of patterns though published before even the structure or role of  was understood turings work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology  experiments suggest that turings work can partially explain growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest  in 2012 sheth et al found that in mice removal of hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a turing type mechanism   later papers though promised were not available until collected works of aampnbspmampnbspturing was published in 1992 
in january 1952 turing then 39 started a relationship with arnold murray a 19 year old unemployed man turing had met murray just before christmas outside the  when walking down manchesters  and invited him to lunch on 23 january turings house was burgled murray told turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and turing reported the crime to the police during the investigation he acknowledged a  sexual relationship with murray homosexual acts were criminal offences in the united kingdom at that time  and both men were charged with gross indecency under  of the  name leavittp268  initial  for the trial were held on 27 february during which turings solicitor reserved his defence
later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor turing entered a plea of guilty  the case  v turing and murray was brought to trial on 31 march 1952  when turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo  treatment designed to reduce  he accepted the option of treatment via injections of  a synthetic  this treatment was continued for the course of one year the treatment rendered turing  and caused   fulfilling in the literal sense turings prediction that no doubt i shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who ive not found out   murray was given a conditional discharge 
turings conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the  the british  agency that had evolved from gcampcs in 1946 though he kept his academic job he was denied entry into the united states after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other european countries even though this was viewed by some as a security risk at the time there was acute public anxiety about homosexual entrapment of spies by soviet agents  because of the recent exposure of the first two members of the   and  as  s turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at bletchley park he was prevented by the  from discussing his war work 
on 8 june 1954 turings housekeeper found him dead he had died the previous day a  examination established that the cause of death was  when his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide  it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed an  determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at  on 12 june 1954  turings ashes were scattered there just as his fathers had been

andrew hodges and another biographer  have both suggested that turing was re enacting a scene from the  film  1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in leavitts words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the wicked queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew and

area is the  that expresses the extent of a  figure or  or  in the   is its analog on the two dimensional  of a   area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape or the amount of  necessary to cover the surface with a single coat name mathworld  it is the two dimensional  of the  of a  a one dimensional concept or the  of a  a three dimensional concept
the area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to s of a fixed size name af  in the  si the standard unit of area is the  written as msup2 sup which is the area of a square whose sides are one  long name b http  wwwbipmorg en cgpm db 11 12  resolution 12 of the 11th meeting of the cgpm 1960 retrieved 15 july 2012   a shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares  in  the  is defined to have area one and the area of any other shape or surface is a  
there are several well known s for the areas of simple shapes such as s s and s  using these formulas the area of any  can be found by  name bkos   for shapes with curved boundary  is usually required to compute the area  indeed the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the

area plays an important role in modern mathematics  in addition to its obvious importance in  and calculus area is related to the definition of s in  and is a basic property of surfaces in  name docarmo differential geometry of curves and surfaces prentice hall 1976 page 98 isbn 978 0 13 212589 5  in  the area of a subset of the plane is defined using  name rudinwalter rudin real and complex analysis mcgraw hill 1966 isbn 0 07 100276 6  though not every subset is measurablegerald folland real analysis modern techniques and their applications john wiley amp sons inc 1999page 20isbn 0 471 31716 0   in general area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of  for two dimensional regions name mathworld 
area can be defined through the use of axioms defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers it can be proved that such a function exists
an approach to defining what is meant by area is through  area can be defined as a function from a collection m of special kind of plane figures termed measurable sets to the set of real numbers which satisfies the following properties
 for all s in m as ≥ 0
 if s and t are in m then so are s ∪ t and s ∩ t and also as∪t   as + at − as∩t
 if s and t are in m with s ⊆ t then t − s is in m and at−s   at − as
 if a set s is in m and s is congruent to t then t is also in m and as   at
 every rectangle r is in m if the rectangle has length h and breadth k then ar   hk
 let q be a set enclosed between two step regions s and t a step region is formed from a finite union of adjacent rectangles resting on a common base ie s ⊆ q ⊆ t if there is a unique number c such that as ≤ c ≤ at for all such step regions s and t then aq   c
it can be proved that such an area function actually exists name moise 
every  has a corresponding unit of area namely the area of a square with the given side length  thus areas can be measured in s msup2 sup square centimetres cmsup2 sup square millimetres mmsup2 sup s kmsup2 sup  ftsup2 sup s ydsup2 sup s misup2 sup and so forth name bipm2006ch5   algebraically these units can be thought of as the  of the corresponding length units
the si unit of area is the square metre which is considered an  name b 
calculation of the area of a square whose length and width are 1 metre would be
1 metre x 1 metre   1ampnbspmsup2 sup
and theore another square with different sides can be calculated as
3 metres x 2 metres   6ampnbspmsup2 sup this is however equivalent to 6 million millimetres square following this 
 1 kilometre  square    metres square
 1 metre square   centimetres square    1000000 millimetres square
 1 centimetre square    millimetres square
 
in non metric units the conversion between two square units is the  of the conversion between the corresponding length units

in the 5th century bce  was the first to show that the area of a disk the region enclosed by a circle is proportional to the square of its diameter as part of his quadrature of the  name heath  but did not identify the   also in the 5th century bce also found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared   this quote may be an overstatement i have not been able to confirm that he discovered the actual formula but perhaps only the proportionality between a and r squared   
subsequently book i of  dealt with equality of areas between two dimensional figures the mathematician  used the tools of  to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a  whose base has the length of the circles circumference and whose height equals the circles radius in his book  the circumference is 2r and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height yielding the area rsup2 sup for the disk archimedes approximated the value of π and hence the area of a unit radius circle with  in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area then doubled the number of sides to give a regular  then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygons area got closer and closer to that of the circle and did the same with s
swiss scientist  in 1761 proved that  the ratio of a circles area to its squared radius is  meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers name arndt english translation by catriona and david lischka  french mathematician  proved in 1794 that πsup2 sup is also irrational in 1882 german mathematician  proved that π is  not the solution of any  with rational coefficients confirming a conjecture made by both  and euler name arndt 
 found what is known as  for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and a proof can be found in his book metrica written around 60 ce it has been suggested that  knew the formula over two centuries earlier  and since metrica is a collection of the mathematical knowledge available in the ancient world it is possible that the formula predates the erence given in that work 
in 499  a great   from the classical age of  and  expressed the area of a triangle as one half the base times the height in the  section 26
a formula equivalent to herons was discovered by the chinese independently of the greeks it was published in 1247 in shushu jiuzhang  written by 
in the 7th century ce  developed a formula now known as  for the area of a  a   in a circle in terms of its sides in 1842 the german mathematicians  and  independently found a formula known as  for the area of any quadrilateral
the development of  by  in the 17th century allowed the development of the  for the area of any polygon with known  locations by  in the 19th century
the development of  in the late 17th century provided tools that could subsequently be used for computing more complicated areas such as the area of an  and the s of various curved three dimensional objects
for a non self intersecting  polygon the  mathx_i  y_i math i 0 1  n 1 of whose n  are known the area is given by the 
 
matha   \frac{1}{2}   \sum_{i   0}^{n   1} x_i y_{i + 1}   x_{i + 1} y_i   math
where when i n 1 then i+1 is expressed as  n and so ers to 0
 
the most basic area formula is the formula for the area of a   given a rectangle with length  and width  the formula for the area is big name af 
ampnbsprectangle
that is the area of the rectangle is the length multiplied by the width  as a special case as  in the case of a square the area of a square with side length  is given by the formula name mathworld  name af 
ampnbspsquare
the formula for the area of a rectangle follows directly from the basic properties of area and is sometimes taken as a  or   on the other hand if  is developed before  this formula can be used to define  of s
 
most other simple formulas for area follow from the method of 
this involves cutting a shape into pieces whose areas must  to the area of the original shape
for an example any  can be subdivided into a  and a  as shown in figure to the left  if the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid then the resulting figure is a rectangle  it follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle name af 
 bigampnbspparallelogram big
however the same parallelogram can also be cut along a  into two  triangles as shown in the figure to the right  it follows that the area of each  is half the area of the parallelogram name af  
matha   \frac{1}{2}bh math bigampnbsptriangle big
similar arguments can be used to find area formulas for the   as well as more complicated s 
 
the formula for the area of a  more properly called  is based on a similar method  given a circle of radius  it is possible to partition the circle into s as shown in the figure to the right  each sector is approximately triangular in shape and the sectors can be rearranged to form and approximate parallelogram  the height of this parallelogram is  and the width is half the  of the circle or   thus the total area of the circle is  or  name af 
 bigampnbspcircle big
though the dissection used in this formula is only approximate the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors  the  of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly  which is the area of the circle name surveyor 
this argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of   in ancient times the  was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle and this method is now recognized as a precursor to   using modern methods the area of a circle can be computed using a 
matha \ \2\int_{ r}^r \sqrt{r^2   x^2}\dx \ \ \pi r^2 math
 
the formula for the area of an  is related to the formula of a circle for an ellipse with  and  axes  and  the formula is name af 
matha   \pi xy  math
 
most basic formulas for  can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out  for example if the side surface of a  or any  is cut lengthwise the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle  similarly if a cut is made along the side of a  the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle and the resulting area computed
the formula for the surface area of a  is more difficult to derive because a sphere has nonzero  it cannot be flattened out  the formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by  in his work   the formula is name mathworldsurfacearea 
 bigampnbspsphere big
where  is the radius of the sphere  as with the formula for the area of a circle any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to 
 
a  math\tfrac12bh math where b is any side and h is the distance from the line on which b lies to the other vertex of the triangle this formula can be used if the height h is known if the lengths of the three sides are known then  can be used math\sqrt{ss as bs c} math where a b c are the sides of the triangle and maths   \tfrac12a + b + c math is half of its perimeter name af  if an angle and its two included sides are given the area is math\tfrac12 a b \sinc math where  is the given angle and  and  are its included sides name af  if the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of math\tfrac12x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1   x_2 y_1   x_3 y_2   x_1 y_3 math this formula is also known as the  and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points xsub1 subysub1 sub xsub2 subysub2 sub and xsub3 subysub3 sub the shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use  to find the area

a variety of unit symbols and abbreviations are in use for the astronomical unit in a 1976 resolution the  iau used the symbol a for the au name iau76   in 2006 the  bipm recommended ua as the symbol for the unit name bureau international des poids et mesures 2006 126  in 2012 the iau noting that various symbols are presently in use for the astronomical unit recommended the use of the symbol au name iauresb2   in the 2014 revision of the si brochure the bipm used the unit symbol au name si_brochure2012  the symbol au name linton2004  name zeilikgregory   name aas_style  and abbreviation au   are also used in  the symbol of the astronomical unit is ua
earths orbit around the sun is an  the  of this ellipse is defined to be half of the straight line segment that joins the aphelion and perihelion the centre of the sun lies on this straight line segment but not at its midpoint because ellipses are well understood shapes measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation in addition it mapped out exactly the largest straight line distance that earth traverses over the course of a year defining times and places for observing the largest  apparent shifts of position in nearby stars knowing earths shift and a stars shift enabled the stars distance to be calculated but all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding throughout the twentieth century measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by   and upon the mathematical tools it used
improving measurements were continually checked and cross checked by means of our understanding of the laws of  which govern the motions of objects in space the expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated in au from these laws and assembled into a collection of data called an    provides one of several ephemeris computation services name horizons 
in 1976 in order to establish a yet more precise measure for the astronomical unit the iau formally adopted  although directly based on the then best available observational measurements the definition was recast in terms of the then best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides it stated that the astronomical unit of length is that length a for which the  k takes the value  when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length mass and time name iau76resolution no 10 of the http  wwwiauorg static resolutions iau1976_frenchpdf xvith general assembly of the international astronomical union grenoble 1976  name trümper  name  fairbridge  equivalently by this definition one au is the radius of an unperturbed circular newtonian orbit about the sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass moving with an  of  name sibrochure  or alternatively that length for which the  the product g is equal to sup2 supampnbspausup3 sup dsup2 sup when the length is used to describe the positions of objects in the solar system
subsequent explorations of the solar system by s made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the  and other objects by means of  and  as with all radar measurements these rely on measuring the time taken for  to be lected from an object because all photons move at the  in vacuum a fundamental constant of the universe the distance of an object from the probe is basically the product of the speed of light and the measured time however for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting in addition the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in the  scale leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day of  by 2009 the iau had updated its standard measures to lect improvements and calculated the speed of light at  tdb 
in 1983 the  cipm modified the  si or modern metric system to make the metre independent of physical objects entirely because other measurements had become too precise for erence to the prototype platinum metre to remain useful instead the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light in vacuum which could be independently determined at need the speed of light could then be expressed exactly as csub0 sub    a standard also adopted by the  numerical standards name iers for complete document see   from this definition and the 2009 iau standard the time for light to traverse an au is found to be τsuba sub    more than 8 minutes by simple multiplication then the best iau 2009 estimate was aampnbsp  csub0 subτsuba subampnbsp   name captaine  based on a comparison of  and  ephemerides name iau  name pitjeva09  
in 2006 the bipm reported a value of the astronomical unit as  name bureau international des poids et mesures 2006 126   in the 2014 revision of the si brochure the bipm recognised the iaus 2012 redefinition of the astronomical unit as  name si_brochure2012  
this estimate was still derived from observation and measurements subject to error and based on techniques that did not yet standardize all relativistic effects and thus were not constant for all observers in 2012 finding that the equalization of relativity alone would make the definition overly complex the iau simply used the 2009 estimate to redefine the astronomical unit as a conventional unit of length directly tied to the metre exactly  name captaine  name nature2012  the new definition also recognizes as a consequence that the astronomical unit is now to play a role of reduced importance limited in its use to that of a convenience in some applications name captaine

with the definitions used before 2012 the astronomical unit was dependent on the  that is the product of the  g and the   neither g nor  can be measured to high accuracy in si units but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets  expressed in terms of newtonian gravitation only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an  so ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in si units
the calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of  in particular time intervals measured on earths surface  tt are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets the terrestrial second tt appears to be longer during the northern hemisphere winter and shorter during the northern hemisphere summer when compared to the planetary second conventionally measured in  tdb this is because the distance between earth and the sun is not fixed it varies between  and  and when earth is closer to the sun  the suns gravitational field is stronger and earth is moving faster along  as the metre is defined in terms of the second and the speed of light is constant for all observers the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the planetary metre on a periodic basis
the metre is defined to be a unit of  but the si definition does not specify the  to be used in determining it indeed the  cipm notes that its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored  as such the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the solar system the 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete because it did not specify the  in which time is to be measured but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed name huang  and vigorous debate ensued name dodd and also p 91 summary and recommendations  until in august 2012 the iau adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit    s

in the 2nd century ce  estimated the mean distance of the sun as  times    to determine this value ptolemy started by measuring the moons parallax finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1° 26′ which was much too large he then derived a maximum lunar distance of 64 earth radii because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure his theory of the moons orbit and other factors this figure was approximately correct name vh1619pp 16–19 van helden 1985 p 251 ptolemys almagest
translated and annotated by g j toomer london duckworth 1984 isbn 0 7156 1588 2  he then measured the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the moon at the moons greatest distance and from records of lunar eclipses he estimated this apparent diameter as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of earth traversed by the moon during a lunar eclipse given these data the distance of the sun from earth can be trigonometrically computed to be  earth radii this gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19 matching aristarchuss figure although ptolemys procedure is theoretically workable it is very sensitive to small changes in the data so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite name vh1619 
after greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval islamic world astronomers made some changes to ptolemys cosmological model but did not greatly change his estimate of the earth–sun distance for example in his introduction to ptolemaic astronomy  gave a mean solar distance of  earth radii whereas in his   used a mean solar distance of  earth radii subsequent astronomers such as  used similar valuespp 29–33 van helden 1985  later in europe  and  also used comparable figures  and  earth radii and so ptolemys approximate earth–sun distance survived through the 16th centurypp 41–53 van helden 1985 
 was the first to realize that ptolemys estimate must be significantly too low according to kepler at least by a factor of three in his  1627  allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the sun and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for earth which could then be applied to the other planets the invention of the  allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye flemish astronomer  repeated aristarchus measurements in 1635 and found that ptolemys value was too low by a factor of at least eleven
a somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the  name bell
an extended historical discussion of this method is provided by 
  by measuring the transit in two different locations one can accurately calculate the  of venus and from the relative distance of earth and venus from the sun the  α which cannot be measured directly name weaver   had attempted to produce an estimate based on  published in 1662 giving a solar parallax of 15 s similar to wendelins figure the solar parallax is related to the earth–sun distance as measured in  by
matha   {\cot\alpha} math
the smaller the solar parallax the greater the distance between the sun and earth a solar parallax of 15 is equivalent to an earth–sun distance of  earth radii
 believed that the distance was even greater by comparing the apparent sizes of venus and  he estimated a value of about  earth radii  equivalent to a solar parallax of 86 although huygens estimate is remarkably close to modern values it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven and incorrect assumptions he had to make for his method to work the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement with his various errors cancelling each other out
 and  measured the parallax of mars between  and  in  when mars was at its closest to earth in 1672 they arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 9 equivalent to an earth–sun distance of about  earth radii they were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of earth which had been measured by their colleague  in 1669 as  thousand s another colleague  discovered the finite  in 1676 the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the sun to the earth or light time per unit distance a convention that is still followed by astronomers today
a better method for observing venus transits was devised by  and published in his  1663 it was strongly advocated by   and was applied to the transits of venus observed in 1761 and 1769 and then again in 1874 and 1882 transits of venus occur in pairs but less than one pair every century and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation despite the  dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger several of them died in the endeavour  the various results were collated by  to give a figure for the solar parallax of 86″

another method involved determining the constant of   gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 880″ for the solar parallax close to the modern value of ″ although newcomb also used data from the transits of venus newcomb also collaborated with  to measure the speed of light with earth based equipment combined with the constant of aberration which is related to the light time per unit distance this gave the first direct measurement of the earth–sun distance in kilometres newcombs value for the solar parallax and for the constant of aberration and the  were incorporated into the first international system of s in 1896conférence internationale des étoiles fondamentales paris 18–21 may 1896  which remained in place for the calculation of  until 1964resolution no 4 of the http  wwwiauorg static resolutions iau1964_frenchpdf xiith general assembly of the international astronomical union hamburg 1964  the name astronomical unit appears first to have been used in 1903http  wwwmerriam webstercom dictionary astronomical%20unit astronomical unit merriam websters online dictionary 
the discovery of the   and its passage near earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement  another international project to measure the parallax of 433 eros was undertaken in 1930–1931 name weaver  
direct radar measurements of the distances to venus and mars became available in the early 1960s along with improved measurements of the speed of light these showed that newcombs values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another

where g is the   is the  k is the numerical value of  and d is the time period of one day
the sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy  so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the sun this has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement 
as the  has an exact defined value in si units and the gaussian gravitational constant k is fixed in the  measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product g in si units hence it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in si units which is increasingly becoming the norm
a 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner solar system suggested that the  in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation + metres per century  name anderson 
the measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial 
furthermore since 2010 the astronomical unit is not yet estimated by the planetary ephemerides

the word art derives from the latin ars stem art  which although literally defined means skill method or technique and conveys a connotation of beauty
during the middle ages the word artist already existed in some countries such as italy but the meaning was something resembling craftsman while the word artesan was still unknown an artist was someone able to do a work better than others so the skilled excellency was underlined rather than the activity field in this period some artisanal products such as textiles were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures
the first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of  1404–1472  de statua de pictura which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills even if in other forms of art there was a  behind

in the first half of the 17th century the church of england and associated episcopal churches in ireland  and in englands american colonies were presented by some anglican divines as comprising a distinct christian tradition with theologies structures and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way or  between reformed protestantism and roman catholicism—a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of anglican identity and was expressed in the description catholic and reformedthe history of the church of england http  wwwcofeanglicanorg about history official church of england website

the word anglican originates in  a  phrase dating to at least 1246 meaning the english church name cat  as an adjective anglican is used to describe the people institutions and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the  name odcc   as a noun an anglican is a member of a church in the anglican communion the word is also used by followers of separated groups which have left the communion or have been founded separately from it though this is sometimes considered as a misuse
although the term anglican is found erring to the church of england as far back as the 16th century its use did not become general until the latter half of the 19th century in british parliamentary legislation erring to the english  there is no need for a description it is simply the church of england though the word protestant is used in many acts specifying the succession to the crown and qualifications for office  when the  created the united church of england and ireland it is specified that it shall be one protestant episcopal church thereby distinguishing its form of church government from the presbyterian polity that prevails in the union with ireland act 1800 article v that it be the fifth article of union that the churches of england and ireland as now by law established be united into one protestant episcopal church to be called the united church of england and ireland and that the doctrine worship discipline and government of the said united church shall be and shall remain in full force for ever as the same are now by law established for the church of england

anglicans celebrate the traditional sacraments with special emphasis being given to the  also called holy communion the lords supper or the  the eucharist is central to worship for most anglicans as a communal offering of prayer and praise in which the life death and resurrection of  are proclaimed through prayer reading of the bible singing giving god thanks over the bread and wine for the innumerable benefits obtained through the passion of christ the breaking of the bread and reception of the bread and wine as representing the body and blood of christ as instituted at the  while many anglicans celebrate the eucharist in similar ways to the predominant western catholic tradition a considerable degree of liturgical freedom is permitted and worship styles range from the simple to elaborate
unique to anglicanism is the  bcp the collection of services that worshippers in most anglican churches used for centuries it was called common prayer originally because it was intended for use in all church of england churches which had previously followed differing local liturgies the term was kept when the church became international because all anglicans used to share in its use around the world
in 1549 the first book of common prayer was compiled by  who was then  while it has since undergone many revisions and anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books the prayer book is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind the anglican communion together

the church in england remained united with rome until the english parliament through the  declared  to be the  in order to fulfill the english desire to be independent from continental europe religiously and politically although now separate from rome the english church at this point in history continued to maintain the roman catholic theology on many things such as the   under  however the church in england underwent what is known as the  in the course of which it acquired a number of characteristics that would subsequently become recognised as constituting a distinct anglican identity 
by the  the protestant identity of the english and irish churches was affirmed through parliamentary legislation which assumed allegiance and loyalty to the british crown in all their members however from the first the elizabethan church began to develop distinct religious traditions assimilating some of the theology of  with the services in the  which drew extensively on the  native to england under the leadership and organisation of a continuing episcopate  and over the years these traditions themselves came to command adherence and loyalty the elizabethan settlement stopped the radical protestant tendencies under edward vi by combining the more radical elements of the second prayer book of 1552 with the conservative catholic first prayer book of 1549 from then on protestantism was in a state of arrested development regardless of the attempts to detach the church of england from its idiosyncratic anchorage in the medieval past by various groups which tried to push it towards a more reformed theology and governance in the years 1560 1660 diarmid macculloch the later reformation in england 1547 1603 ppampnbsp141–142 it has resolutely used to identify decisively as catholic or protestant and sees it as a virtue rather than a handicap macculloch ibid indeed it pers to see itself as both
although two important constitutive elements of what later would emerge as anglicanism were present in 1559 – the  and the book of common prayer – neither the laypeople nor the clergy perceived themselves as anglicans at the beginning of elizabeth is reign historical studies on the period 1560 1660 written before the late 1960s tended to project the predominant conformist spirituality and doctrine of the 1660s on the ecclesiastical situation one hundred years before and there was also a tendency to take polemically binary partitions of reality claimed by contestants studied such as the dichotomies protestant popish or laudian puritan at face value since the late 1960s these fallacies have been criticized studies on the subject written during the last forty five years have however not reached any consensus on how to interpret this period in english church history the extent to which one or several positions concerning doctrine and spirituality existed alongside the more well known and articulate puritan movement and the durham house party and the exact extent of continental calvinism among the english elite and among the ordinary churchgoers from the 1560s to the 1620s are subjects of current and ongoing debatefor a study stressing the hegemony of continental calvinism before the 1620s see tyacke nicholas anti calvinists the rise of english arminianism c 1590 1640 clarendon press oxford 1987 for a study perceiving an emerging self conscious prayer book episcopalism distinct from but a predecessor to  anglicanism see maltby judith prayer book and people in elizabethan and early stuart england cambridge university press cambridge 1998

in so far as anglicans derived their identity from both parliamentary legislation and ecclesiastical tradition a crisis of identity could result wherever secular and religious loyalties came into conflict – and such a crisis indeed occurred in 1776 with the  most of whose signatories were at least nominally anglican  for these american patriots even the forms of anglican services were in doubt since the prayer book rites of   and holy communion all included specific prayers for the british royal family consequently the conclusion of the  eventually resulted in the creation of two new anglican churches  in those states that had achieved independence and in the 1830s  became independent from the church of england in those north american colonies which had remained under british control and to which many loyalist churchmen had migrated name edwards 1984 43 
reluctantly legislation was passed in the british parliament the  to allow bishops to be consecrated for an american church outside of allegiance to the british crown whereas no bishoprics had ever been established in the former american colonies name edwards 1984 43  both in the united states and in canada the new anglican churches developed novel models of self government collective decision making and self supported financing that would be consistent with separation of religious and secular identities 
in the following century two further factors acted to accelerate the development of a distinct anglican identity from 1828 and 1829  and catholics could be elected to the   which consequently ceased to be a body drawn purely from the established churches of scotland england and ireland but which nevertheless over the following ten years engaged in extensive orming legislation affecting the interests of the english and irish churches which by the  had been reconstituted as the  the propriety of this legislation was bitterly contested by the  tractarians  who in response developed a vision of anglicanism as religious tradition deriving ultimately from the  of the patristic church those within the church of england opposed to the tractarians and to their revived ritual practices introduced a stream of parliamentary bills aimed to control innovations in worship  this only made the dilemma more acute with consequent continual litigation in the secular and ecclesiastical courts
over the same period anglican churches engaged vigorously in  resulting in the creation by the end of the century of over ninety colonial bishoprics  which gradually coalesced into new self governing churches on the canadian and american models however the case of   reinstated in 1865 by the english  over the heads of the church in south africa  demonstrated acutely that the extension of episcopacy had to be accompanied by a recognised anglican ecclesiology of ecclesiastical authority distinct from secular power
consequently at the instigation of the bishops of canada and south africa the first  was called in 1867  to be followed by further conferences in 1878 and 1888 and thereafter at ten year intervals the various papers and declarations of successive lambeth conferences have served to frame the continued anglican debate on identity especially as relating to the possibility of ecumenical discussion with other churches this ecumenical aspiration became much more of a possibility as other denominational groups rapidly followed the example of the anglican communion in founding their own transnational alliances the  the  the  and the 
in their rejection of absolute parliamentary authority the  – and in particular  – looked back to the writings of 17th century anglican divines finding in these texts the idea of the english church as a via media between the protestant and catholic traditions name morris  this view was associated – especially in the writings of  – with the theory of anglicanism as one of three  alongside the catholic church and the orthodox church historically arising out of the common tradition of the earliest  newman himself subsequently rejected the theory of the via media as essentially historicist and static and hence unable to accommodate any dynamic development within the church name morris   nevertheless the aspiration to ground anglican identity in the writings of the 17th century divines and in faithfulness to the traditions of the  lects a continuing theme of anglican ecclesiology most recently in the writings of  
the tractarian formulation of the theory of the via media was essentially a party platform and not acceptable to anglicans outside the confines of the  however the theory of the via media was reworked in the ecclesiological writings of  in a more dynamic form that became widely influential both maurice and newman saw the church of england of their day as sorely deficient in faith but whereas newman had looked back to a distant past when the light of faith might have appeared to burn brighter maurice looked forward to the possibility of a brighter revelation of faith in the future maurice saw the protestant and catholic strands within the church of england as contrary but complementary both maintaining elements of the true church but incomplete without the other such that a true catholic and evangelical church might come into being by a union of opposites 
central to maurices perspective was his belief that the collective elements of family nation and church represented a divine order of structures through which god unfolds his continuing work of creation hence for maurice the protestant tradition had maintained the elements of national distinction which were amongst the marks of the true universal church but which had been lost within contemporary roman catholicism in the internationalism of centralized papal authority within the coming universal church that maurice foresaw national churches would each maintain the six signs of catholicity baptism eucharist the creeds scripture an episcopal ministry and a fixed liturgy which could take a variety of forms in accordance with divinely ordained distinctions in national characteristics name morris   not surprisingly this vision of a becoming universal church as a congregation of autonomous national churches proved highly congenial in anglican circles and maurices six signs were adapted to form the  of 1888 
in the latter decades of the 20th century maurices theory and the various strands of anglican thought that derived from it have been criticised by   who argues that the terms protestant and catholic as used in these approaches are synthetic constructs denoting ecclesiastic identities unacceptable to those to whom the labels are applied hence the catholic church does not regard itself as a party or strand within the universal church – but rather identifies itself as the universal church moreover sykes criticises the proposition implicit in theories of via media that there is no distinctive body of anglican doctrine other than those of the universal church accusing this of being an excuse not to undertake systematic doctrine at all 
contrariwise sykes notes a high degree of commonality in anglican liturgical forms and in the doctrinal understandings expressed within those liturgies he proposes that anglican identity might rather be found within a shared consistent pattern of prescriptive liturgies established and maintained through canon law and embodying both a historic deposit of formal statements of doctrine and also framing the regular reading and proclamation of scripture  sykes nevertheless agrees with those heirs of maurice who emphasise the incompleteness of anglicanism as a positive feature and quotes with qualified approval the words of 
in the time of  the nature of anglicanism was based on questions of jurisdiction – specifically the belief of the crown that es should be autonomous – rather than theological disagreement the effort was to create a national church in legal continuity with its traditions but inclusive of certain doctrinal and liturgical beliefs of the  the result has been a movement with a distinctive self image among christian movements the question often arises as to whether the anglican communion should be identified as a protestant or  church or perhaps as a distinct branch of christianity altogether
the distinction between reformed and catholic and the coherence of the two is routinely a matter of debate both within specific anglican churches and throughout the anglican communion by members themselves since the  of the mid 19th century many churches of the communion have revived and extended liturgical and pastoral practices similar to roman catholicism this extends beyond the ceremony of  services to even more theologically significant territory such as sacramental theology see  while  practices particularly liturgical ones have resurfaced and become more common within the tradition over the last century there remain many places where practices and beliefs remain on the more reformed or evangelical side see 
for high church anglicans doctrine is neither established by a  nor derived from the theology of an  founder such as  nor summed up in a confession of faith beyond the ecumenical s such as the   for them the earliest anglican theological documents are its prayer books which they see as the products of profound theological lection compromise and synthesis they emphasise the  as a key expression of anglican doctrine the principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the latin name  the law of prayer is the law of belief
within the prayer books are the fundamentals of anglican doctrine the  and  creeds the  now rarely used the scriptures via the lectionary the sacraments daily prayer the  and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry for some low church and evangelical anglicans the 16th century  thirty nine articles form the basis of doctrine
 
the  played a significant role in anglican doctrine and practice following the passing of the 1604 canons all anglican clergy had to formally subscribe to the articles today however the articles are no longer binding but are seen as a historical document which has played a significant role in the shaping of anglican identity the degree to which each of the articles has remained influential varies
on the doctrine of  for example there is a wide range of beliefs within the anglican communion with some  arguing for a faith with good works and the sacraments at the same time however some  anglicans ascribe to the reformed emphasis on  faith alone in their doctrine of justification see  still other anglicans adopt a nuanced view of justification taking elements from the early     and  thought
arguably the most influential of the original articles has been article vi on the sufficiency of scripture which says that scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation so that whatsoever is not read therein nor may be proved thereby is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an article of the faith or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation this article has informed anglican biblical  and  since earliest times
anglicans look for authority in their standard divines see below historically the most influential of these – apart from cranmer – has been the 16th century cleric and theologian  who after 1660 was increasingly portrayed as the founding father of anglicanism hookers description of anglican authority as being derived primarily from scripture informed by reason the intellect and the experience of god and tradition the practices and beliefs of the historical church has influenced anglican self identity and doctrinal lection perhaps more powerfully than any other formula the analogy of the three legged stool of   and  is often incorrectly attributed to hooker rather hookers description is a hierarchy of authority with scripture as foundational and reason and tradition as vitally important but secondary authorities
finally the extension of anglicanism into non english cultures the growing diversity of prayer books and the increasing interest in ecumenical dialogue has led to further lection on the parameters of anglican identity many anglicans look to the  of 1888 as the sine qua non of communal identity name lec  in brief the quadrilaterals four points are the scriptures as containing all things necessary to salvation the creeds specifically the apostles and nicene creeds as the sufficient statement of christian faith the dominical sacraments of  and  and the historic  name lec  
 
within the anglican tradition divines are clergy of the  whose theological writings have been considered standards for faith doctrine worship and spirituality and whose influence has permeated the anglican communion in varying degrees through the yearssykes stephen and john e booty https  booksgooglecom booksid dyymriii3n0camppg pa176amplpg pa176ampdq list+of+anglican+divinesampsource blampots fehko9l57vampsig  jzaom9qbx0phakdj5ohe4uygc8amphl enampsa xampved 0ahukewjympha25hkahuiwz4khagbbo0q6aeiqdae#v onepageampqampf false the study of anglicanism philadelphia pa spck fortress press 1988  while there is no authoritative list of these anglican divines there are some whose names would likely be found on most lists – those who are commemorated in  of the anglican churches and those whose works are frequently  
the corpus produced by anglican divines is diverse what they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by scripture and the book of common prayer thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the   on the whole anglican divines view the  of anglicanism not as a compromise but as a positive position witnessing to the universality of god and gods kingdom working through the fallible earthly ecclesia anglicana 
these theologians regard scripture as interpreted through tradition and reason as authoritative in matters concerning salvation reason and tradition indeed is extant in and presupposed by scripture thus implying co operation between god and humanity god and nature and between the sacred and secular faith is thus regarded as al and authority as dispersed
among the early anglican divines of the 16th and 17th centuries the names of      and  predominate the influential character of hookers  cannot be overestimated published in 1593 and subsequently hookers eight volume work is primarily a treatise on church state relations but it deals comprehensively with issues of    and  throughout the work hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with ultimate issues and that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church
the 18th century saw the rise of two important movements in anglicanism  with its mystical understanding of reason as the candle of the lord and the   with its emphasis on the personal experience of the  the cambridge platonist movement evolved into a school called  which emphasised reason as the barometer of discernment and took a stance of indifference towards doctrinal and ecclesiological differences

in contrast to this movement clergy such as the bishop of liverpool  sought to uphold the distinctly reformed identity of the church of england he was not a servant of the status quo but argued for a lively religion which emphasised grace holy and charitable living and the plain use of the 1662 book of common prayer interpreted in a partisan evangelical waythe 19th century evangelical interpretation of the prayerbook now less frequent included celebration of holy communion while the priest was standing at the northern short side of the communion table this misinterpretation was caused by the fact that the 1662 book of common prayer retained two contradictory rubrics from 1552 a rubric was retained that the priest should stand at the northern long side of a communion table standing east west in the choir the communicants sitting in the choir stalls by the northern and southern walls from 1559 was retained the rubric that the chancels shall remain as they have done in times past originally intended to protect the mediaeval interior of church buildings from calvinist vandalism and – mainly neglected during the reigns of elizabeth i and james i – it was not consented to generally before the reign of charles ii during the reign of elizabeth i only the  retained the mediaeval position of the communion table standing permanently north south at the east wall of the choir the parish of st giles cripplegate london began to apply the chapels royal arrangement of the communion table in 1599 or 1605 and from there it began to spread archbishop lauds attempt to make it mandatory in the 1630s backfired with well known consequences by the reign of charles ii however it was applied generally and the original intention of the northward position rubric became unintelligible and easily misunderstood  without additional rituals  through such works as  played a pivotal role in inaugurating another movement  in this maurice transformed hookers emphasis on the al nature of anglican spirituality to an imperative for social justice
in the 19th century anglican biblical scholarship began to assume a distinct character represented by the so called cambridge triumvirate of   and  their orientation is best summed up by lightfoots observation that life which christ is and which christ communicates the life which fills our whole beings as we realise its capacities is active fellowship with god
the earlier part of the 20th century is marked by  with his emphasis on  and s focus on christianity and society while from outside england  archbishop of glasgow and several clergy from the united states have been suggested such as   1775–1830 bishop of new york 1816–30   and  
churchmanship can be defined as the manifestation of theology in the realms of liturgy piety and to some extent spirituality anglican diversity in this respect has tended to lect the diversity in the traditions reformed and catholic identity different individuals groups parishes dioceses and provinces may identify more closely with one or the other or some mixture of the two
the range of anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century when some clergy were disciplined and even imprisoned on charges of  while at the same time others were criticised for engaging in public worship services with ministers of reformed churches resistance to the growing acceptance and restoration of traditional catholic ceremonial by the mainstream of anglicanism ultimately led to the formation of small breakaway churches such as the  in england 1844 and the  in north america 1873http  wwwfcofeorguk about_the_free_church_of_englandhtm accessed 9 november 2010 http  rechurchorg recus mival  recweb foundationshtmlampdisplay overview accessed 9 november 2010 
 and some broad church anglicans celebrate public liturgy in ways that understand worship to be something very special and of utmost importance  are worn by the clergy sung settings are often used and  may be used nowadays in most anglican churches the eucharist is celebrated in a manner similar to the usage of catholics and some lutherans though in many churches more traditional pre vatican ii models of worship are common eg an eastward orientation at the altar whilst many anglo catholics derive much of their liturgical practice from that of the pre reformation english church others more closely follow traditional roman catholic practices
the eucharist may sometimes be celebrated in the form known as  with a priest deacon and  dressed in traditional vestments with incense and  and with prayers adapted from the  or other sources by the celebrant such churches may also have forms of  such as benediction of the blessed sacrament in terms of personal piety some anglicans may recite the  and  be involved in a devotional society dedicated to our lady the  and seek the intercession of the saints
in recent years the prayer books of several provinces have out of deference to a greater agreement with eastern  and a perceived greater respect accorded anglicanism by eastern orthodoxy than by roman catholicism instituted a number of historically eastern and  elements in their liturgies including introduction of the  and deletion of the  clause from the 
for their part those  and some broad church anglicans who emphasise the more protestant aspects of the church stress the reformation theme of  by grace through faith they emphasise the two dominical sacraments of baptism and eucharist viewing the other five as lesser rites some evangelical anglicans may even tend to take the inerrancy of scripture literally adopting the view of article vi that it contains all things necessary to salvation in an explicit sense worship in churches influenced by these principles tends to be significantly less elaborate with greater emphasis on the  the reading of the scriptures the sermon and the intercessory prayers
the order for holy communion may be celebrated bi weekly or monthly in perence to the s by priests attired in  or more regular clothes rather than eucharistic vestments ceremony may be in keeping with their view of the provisions of the 17th century puritans – being a  interpretation of the  – no candles no incense no bells and a minimum of manual actions by the presiding celebrant such as touching the elements at the 
in recent decades there has been a growth of  worship among anglicans both anglo catholics and evangelicals have been affected by this movement such that it is not uncommon to find typically charismatic postures music and other themes evident during the services of otherwise anglo catholic or evangelical parishes
the spectrum of anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels many anglicans locate themselves somewhere in the spectrum of the broad church tradition and consider themselves an amalgam of evangelical and catholic such anglicans stress that anglicanism is the  middle way between the two major strains of western christianity and that anglicanism is like a bridge between the two strains
in accord with its prevailing self identity as a  or middle path of  anglican sacramental theology expresses elements in keeping with its status as being both a church in the  tradition as well as a  church with respect to sacramental theology the catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance anglicanism places on the s as a means of   and  as expressed in the churchs  and doctrine
of the seven sacraments all anglicans recognise  and the  as being directly instituted by christ the other five —     also called ordination and  also called unction — are regarded variously as full sacraments by s many  and some  anglicans but merely as sacramental rites by other broad church and  anglicans especially s associated with  and the 
 
anglican eucharistic theology is divergent in practice lecting the essential comprehensiveness of the tradition some  anglicans take a strictly memorialist an view of the sacrament in other words they see holy communion as a memorial to christs suffering and participation in the eucharist as both a re enactment of the last supper and a foreshadowing of the heavenly banquet – the fulfilment of the eucharistic promise
other low church anglicans believe in the  but deny that the presence of christ is carnal or is necessarily localised in the bread and wine despite explicit criticism in the  many high church or anglo catholic anglicans hold more or less the catholic view of the real presence as expressed in the doctrine of  seeing the eucharist as a liturgical representation of christs atoning sacrifice with the elements actually transformed into christs body and blood
the majority of anglicans however have in common a belief in the real presence defined in one way or another to that extent they are in the company of the continental ormer  rather than

an anglican position on the eucharistic sacrifice sacrifice of the mass was expressed in the response  of the archbishops of canterbury and york to s papal encyclical 
anglican and catholic representatives declared that they had substantial agreement on the doctrine of the eucharist in the windsor statement on eucharistic doctrine from the anglican roman catholic international consultation 1971http  wwwvaticanva roman_curia pontifical_councils chrstuni angl comm docs rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_1971_eucharistic doctrine_enhtml vatican website  and the http  wwwvaticanva roman_curia pontifical_councils chrstuni angl comm docs rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_1979_eucharistic elucidation_enhtml elucidation of the arcic windsor statement 1979 the http  wwwvaticanva roman_curia pontifical_councils chrstuni angl comm docs rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_1991_catholic response arcici_enhtml final response 1991 to these documents by the vatican made it plain that it did not consider the degree of agreement reached to be satisfactory
in anglicanism there is a distinction between liturgy which is the formal public and communal worship of the church and personal prayer and devotion which may be public or private liturgy is regulated by the prayer books and consists of the holy eucharist some call it holy communion or mass the other six sacraments and the divine office or liturgy of the hours
the  bcp is the foundational prayer book of anglicanism the original book of 1549 revised 1552 was one of the instruments of the  replacing the various uses or rites in latin that had been used in different parts of the country with a single compact volume in the language of the people so that now from henceforth all the realm shall have but one use suppressed under queen  it was revised in 1559 and then again in 1662 after the  of  this version was made mandatory in england and wales by the  and was in standard use until the mid 20th century
with  expansion from the 17th century onwards the anglican church was planted around the globe these churches at first used and then revised the book of common prayer until they like their parent church produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries which come under the general heading of the 
anglican worship services are open to all visitors anglican worship originates principally in the orms of  who aimed to create a set order of service like that of the pre reformation church but less complex in its seasonal variety and said in english rather than  this use of a set order of service is not unlike the catholic tradition traditionally the pattern was that laid out in the  although many anglican churches now use a wide range of modern service books written in the local language the structures of the book of common prayer are largely retained churches which call themselves anglican will have identified themselves so because they use some form or variant of the book of common prayer in the shaping of their worship
anglican worship however is as diverse as anglican theology a contemporary  or evangelical service may differ little from the worship of many mainstream non anglican protestant churches the service is constructed around a sermon focused on biblical exposition and opened with one or more bible readings and closed by a series of prayers both set and extemporised and hymns or songs a  or anglo catholic service by contrast is usually a more formal  celebrated by clergy in distinctive  and may be almost indistinguishable from a roman catholic service often resembling the pre vatican ii 
between these extremes are a variety of styles of worship often involving a robed choir and the use of the organ to accompany the singing and to provide music before and after the service anglican churches tend to have s or chairs and it is usual for the congregation to kneel for some prayers but to stand for hymns and other parts of the service such as the gloria collect gospel reading creed and either the pace or all of the eucharistic prayer high anglicans may genuflect or cross themselves in the same way as roman catholics
other more traditional anglicans tend to follow the 1662  and retain the use of the king james bible this is typical in many anglican cathedrals and particularly in s such as the  and the  these services lect the original anglican doctrine and differ from the  in that they are in favour of women vicars and the ability of vicars to marry these anglican church services include classical music instead of songs hymns from the  usually excluding modern hymns such as lord of the dance and are generally non evangelical and formal in practice due to their association with royalty these churches are generally host to staunch anglicans who are strongly opposed to catholicism
until the mid 20th century the main sunday service was typically  but the  has once again become the standard form of sunday worship in many anglican churches this again is similar to roman catholic practice other common sunday services include an early morning eucharist without music an abbreviated eucharist following a service of morning prayer and a service of  sometimes in the form of sung  usually celebrated between 3 and 6ampnbsppm the late evening service of  was revived in parish use in the early 20th century many anglican churches will also have daily morning and evening prayer and some have midweek or even daily celebration of the eucharist
an anglican service whether or not a eucharist will include readings from the bible that are generally taken from a standardised  which provides for much of the bible and some passages from the  to be read out loud in the church over a cycle of one two or three years depending on which eucharistic and office lectionaries are used respectively the  or  is typically about ten to twenty minutes in length though it may be much longer in evangelical churches even in the most informal evangelical services it is common for set prayers such as the weekly  to be read there are also set forms for  though this is now more often extemporaneous in high and anglo catholic churches there are generally prayers for the dead
although anglican public worship is usually ordered according to the canonically approved services in practice many anglican churches use forms of service outside these norms many evangelical churches as well as extreme anglo catholic ones sit lightly to the set forms of morning and evening prayer though generally respecting the canonical order of holy communion liberal churches may use freely structured or experimental forms of worship including patterns borrowed from ecumenical traditions such as those of  or the 
 parishes might use the modern roman catholic liturgy of the  or more traditional forms such as the  which is translated into english in the  the  or less commonly the  catholic devotions such as the   and  are also common among anglo catholics
 
only  persons are eligible to receive communion name communion  although in many churches communion is restricted to those who have not only been baptised but also  in many anglican provinces however all baptised christians are now often invited to receive communion and some dioceses have regularised a system for admitting baptised young people to communion before they are confirmed
the discipline of fasting before communion is practised by some anglicans most anglican priests require the presence of at least one other person for the celebration of the eucharist erring back to christs statement in matthew 1820 when two or more are gathered in my name i will be in the midst of them though some anglo catholic priests like roman catholic priests may say private masses as in the roman catholic church it is a canonical requirement to use fermented  for communion
unlike in roman catholicism the consecrated bread and wine are always offered to the congregation at a eucharistic service communion in both kinds this practice is becoming more frequent in the roman catholic church as well especially through the  in some churches the sacrament is reserved in a tabernacle or  with a lighted candle or lamp nearby in anglican churches only a priest or a bishop may be the celebrant at the eucharist
all anglican prayer books contain offices for  matins and  evensong in the original book of common prayer these were derived from combinations of the ancient monastic offices of  and  and  and  respectively the prayer offices have an important place in anglican history
prior to the  of the 19th century which eventually restored the  as the principal sunday liturgy and especially during the 18th century a morning service combining matins the  and ante communion comprised the usual expression of common worship while matins and evensong were sung daily in cathedrals and some collegiate chapels this nurtured a tradition of distinctive  applied to the s and s used at the offices although  is often used as well
in some official and many unofficial anglican service books these offices are supplemented by other offices such as the  of  and prayer during the day such as    and  some anglican monastic communities have a  based on that of the book of common prayer but with additional antiphons and canticles etc for specific days of the week specific psalms etc see for example http  wwwholycrossmonasterycom  holy cross monastery   bot generated title     and order of st helena editors a monastic breviary wilton conn morehouse barlow 1976 the all saints sisters of the poorhttp  wwwgeocitiescom xnomad4 indexhtml    with convents in catonsville maryland and elsewhere use an elaborated version of the anglican daily office the  publishes celebrating common prayer which has become especially popular for use among anglicans
in england the united states canada australia new zealand and some other anglican provinces the modern prayer books contain four offices

 prayer during the day roughly corresponding to the combination of terce sext and none noonday prayer in the usa
 evening prayer corresponding to vespers and compline

in addition most prayer books include a section of prayers and devotions for family use in the us these offices are further supplemented by an order of worship for the evening a prelude to or an abbreviated form of evensong partly derived from  prayers in the united kingdom the publication of daily prayer the third volume of  was published in 2005 it retains the services for morning and evening prayer and compline and includes a section entitled prayer during the day a new zealand prayer book of 1989 provides different outlines for matins and evensong on each day of the week as well as midday prayer night prayer and family prayer
some anglicans who pray the office on daily basis use the present  of the catholic church in many cities especially in england anglican and catholic priests and lay people often meet several times a week to pray the office in common a small but enthusiastic minority use the  or other translations and adaptations of the pre vatican ii roman rite and  along with supplemental material from cognate western sources to provide such things as a common of octaves a common of holy women and other additional material others may privately use idiosyncratic forms borrowed from a wide range of christian traditions

contrary to popular misconception the british monarch is not the constitutional head but in law the  of the church of england nor does he or she have any role in provinces outside england the role of the crown in the church of england is practically limited to the appointment of bishops including the archbishop of canterbury and even this role is limited as the church presents the government with a short list of candidates to choose from this process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives see  the monarch has no constitutional role in anglican churches in other parts of the world although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign
a characteristic of anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority all thirty nine provinces of the anglican communion are autonomous each with their own  and governing structure these provinces may take the form of national churches such as in canada uganda or japan or a collection of nations such as the west indies central africa or south asia or geographical regions such as vanuatu and solomon islands etc within these communion provinces may exist subdivisions called s under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop

many provinces of the  ordain both men and women as deacons many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate the effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time as most men proceeded to be ordained priest after a short time as a deacon

since the 1960s there has been a sharp decline in the number of professed religious in most parts of the anglican communion especially in north america europe and australia many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single  or  with memberships of elderly men or women in the last few decades of the 20th century novices have for most communities been few and far between some orders and communities have already become extinct there are however still thousands of anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world and religious life in many parts of the communion – especially in developing nations – flourishes

the 19th century saw the founding and expansion of social oriented evangelism with societies such as the  cpas in 1836  in 1856  in 1876 and  in 1882 all carrying out a personal form of evangelism

anglican interest in  dialogue can be traced back to the time of the reformation and dialogues with both orthodox and lutheran churches in the 16th century in the 19th century with the rise of the oxford movement there arose greater concern for reunion of the churches of catholic confession this desire to work towards full  with other denominations led to the development of the  approved by the third  of 1888 the four points the sufficiency of scripture the historic creeds the two dominical sacraments and the historic episcopate were proposed as a basis for discussion although they have frequently been taken as a non negotiable bottom line for any form of reunion

anglican concern with broader issues of social justice can be traced to its earliest divines richard hooker for instance wrote that god hath created nothing simply for itself but each thing in all things and of every thing each part in other have such interest that in the whole world nothing is found whereunto any thing created can say i need thee not
this and related statements lect the deep thread of  running through anglican social thought – a theology which sees god nature and humanity in dynamic interaction and the interpenetration of the secular and the sacred in the make up of the cosmos such theology is informed by a traditional english spiritual ethos rooted in celtic christianity and reinforced by anglicanisms origins as an  bound up by its structure in the life and interests of civil society
repeatedly throughout anglican history this principle has reasserted itself in movements of social justice for instance in the 18th century the influential evangelical anglican  along with others campaigned against the slave trade in the 19th century the dominant issues concerned the adverse effects of industrialisation the usual anglican response was to focus on education and give support to the national society for the education of the children of the poor in the principles of the church of england 
lord shaftesbury a devout evangelical campaigned to improve the conditions in factories in mines for chimney sweeps and for the education of the very poor for years he was chairman of the  board frederick denison maurice was a leading figure advocating orm founding so called producers co operatives and the  his work was instrumental in the establishment of the  movement although he himself was not in any real sense a socialist but a tory paternalist with the unusual desire to theories his acceptance of the traditional obligation to help the poor  influenced anglo catholics such as charles gore who wrote that the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of  in the 1930s and 1940s
a question of whether or not christianity is a  religion has remained a matter of debate for anglicans in 1937 the  emerged as a distinct orm organisation seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of anglican theology the group rapidly gained popularity amongst anglican intellectuals including   and former british political leader  furthermore the reverend  who during the 1930s was one of britains most famous anglican priests due to his landmark sermon broadcasts for   founded the  a  pacifist organisation for the non religious that gained considerable support throughout the 1930s
whilst never actively endorsed by the anglican church many anglicans unofficially have adopted the augustinian  doctrine the anglican pacifist fellowship remain highly active throughout the anglican world it rejects this doctrine of just war and seeks to orm the church by reintroducing the pacifism inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest christians and present in their interpretation of christs  the principles of the anglican pacifist fellowship are often formulated as a statement of belief that jesus teaching is incompatible with the waging of war that a christian church should never support or justify war and that our christian witness should include opposing the waging or justifying of warhttp  wwwanglicanpeacemakerorguk  anglican pacifist fellowship   bot generated title    
confusing the matter was the fact that the 37th article of religion in the book of common prayer states that it is lawful for christian men at the commandment of the magistrate to wear weapons and serve in the wars theore the lambeth council in the modern era has sought to provide a clearer position by repudiating modern war and developed a statement that has been affirmed at each subsequent meeting of the council
this statement was strongly reasserted when the 67th general convention of the episcopal church reaffirms the statement made by the anglican bishops assembled at lambeth in 1978 and adopted by the 66th general convention of the episcopal church in 1979 calling christian people everywhere  to engage themselves in non violent action for justice and peace and to support others so engaged recognizing that such action will be controversial and may be personally very costly this general convention in obedience to this call urges all members of this church to support by prayer and by such other means as they deem appropriate those who engaged in such non violent action and particularly those who suffer for conscience sake as a result and be it further resolved that this general convention calls upon all members of this church seriously to consider the implications for their own lives of this call to resist war and work for peace for their own lives
the focus on other social issues became increasingly diffuse after the  on the one hand the growing independence and strength of anglican churches in the global south brought new emphasis to issues of global poverty the inequitable distribution of resources and the lingering effects of colonialism in this regard figures such as  and  were instrumental in mobilizing anglicans worldwide against the  policies of  rapid social change in the industrialised world during the 20th century compelled the church to examine issues of gender sexuality and marriage
 
these changes led to lambeth conference resolutions countenancing  and the  of divorced persons they led to most provinces approving the  in more recent years it has led some jurisdictions to permit the ordination of people in same sex relationships and to authorise rites for the blessing of same sex unions see  more conservative elements within and outside of anglicanism primarily african churches and factions within north american anglicanism have opposed these proposals name sexteaching 
some liberal and moderate anglicans see this opposition as representing a new  within anglicanism others see the advocacy for these proposals as representing a breakdown of christian theology and commitment the lack of social consensus among and within provinces of diverse cultural traditions has resulted in considerable conflict and even schism concerning some or all of these developments see  some anglicans opposed to various liberalising changes in particular the  have converted to roman catholicism others have at various times joined the 
these latter trends lect a countervailing tendency in anglicanism towards insularity reinforced perhaps by the big tent nature of the movement which seeks to be comprehensive of various views and tendencies the insularity and complacency of the early established  has tended to influence anglican self identity and inhibit engagement with the broader society in favour of internal debate and dialogue nonetheless there is significantly greater cohesion among anglicans when they turn their attention outward anglicans worldwide are active in many areas of social and environmental concern
the term  ers to a number of church bodies which have formed outside of the  in the belief that traditional forms of anglican faith worship and order have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some anglican communion churches in recent decades they theore claim that they are continuing traditional anglicanism
the modern continuing anglican movement principally dates to the  held in the united states in 1977 at which participants rejected changes that had been made in the episcopal churchs  and also the episcopal churchs approval of the  to the priesthood more recent changes in the north american churches of the anglican communion such as the introduction of same sex marriage rites and the ordination of gay and lesbian people to the  and  have created further separations
continuing churches have generally been formed by people who have left the anglican communion the original anglican churches are charged by the continuing anglicans with being greatly compromised by secular cultural standards and liberal theology many continuing anglicans believe that the faith of some churches in communion with the archbishop of canterbury has become  and theore have not sought to also be in communion with him
the original generation of continuing parishes in the united states were found mainly in metropolitan areas since the late 1990s a number have appeared in smaller communities often as a result of a division in the towns existing episcopal churches the 2007–08 directory of traditional anglican and episcopal parishes published by the fellowship of concerned churchmen contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the continuing anglican churches or the anglican realignment movement a more recent wave of anglicans withdrawing from the anglican communions north american provinces

acoustic theory is a mathematical field that relates to the description of  it derives from  see  for the  approach
propagation of sound waves in a fluid such as water can be modeled by an equation of continuity conservation of  and an equation of motion conservation of    with some simplifications in particular constant density they can be given as follows
 math
  \begin{align}
     \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa~\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} amp   0  \qquad \text{mass balance} \\
     \rho_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla p amp   0  \qquad \text{momentum balance}
  \end{align}
 math
where mathp\mathbf{x} t math is the acoustic pressure and math\mathbf{u}\mathbf{x} t math is the  vector math\mathbf{x} math is the vector of spatial coordinates mathx y z math matht math is the time math\rho_0 math is the static mass density of the medium and math\kappa math is the  of the medium  the bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium mathc_0 math as
 math\kappa   \rho_0 c_0^2 ~ math
if the flow velocity field is  math \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \mathbf{0} math then the  is a combination of these two sets of balance equations and can be expressed as douglas d reynolds 1981 engineering principles in acoustics allyn and bacon inc boston 
math
   \cfrac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial t^2}   c_0^2~\nabla^2\mathbf{u}   0
   \qquad \text{or} \qquad
   \cfrac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2}   c_0^2~\nabla^2 p   0
  math
where we have used the  math \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}   \nabla\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}   \nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{u}  math
the acoustic wave equation and the mass and momentum balance equations are often expressed in terms of a  math\varphi math where math\mathbf{u}   \nabla\varphi math  in that case the acoustic wave equation is written as
math
  \cfrac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2}   c_0^2~\nabla^2 \varphi   0
  math
and the momentum balance and mass balance are expressed as
math
   p + \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}   0 ~~~
   \rho + \cfrac{\rho_0}{c_0^2}~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}   0 ~
  math
the derivations of the above equations for waves in an acoustic medium are given below
the equations for the  for a fluid medium are
math
   \rho \left\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right    \nabla p + \nabla \cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} + \rho\mathbf{g}
  math
where math\mathbf{g} math is the body force per unit mass mathp math is the pressure and math\boldsymbol{\tau} math is the   if math\boldsymbol{\sigma} math is the  then
math
   p    \tfrac{1}{3}~\text{tr}\boldsymbol{\sigma} ~~~
   \boldsymbol{\sigma}   \boldsymbol{\tau} + p~\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
 math
where math \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}} math is the rank 2 identity tensor
we make several assumptions to derive the momentum balance equation for an acoustic medium  these assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below
 
in acoustics the fluid medium is assumed to be   for a newtonian fluid the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the flow velocity by
math\boldsymbol{\tau}   \mu~\left\nabla\mathbf{u} + \nabla\mathbf{u}^t\right +
       \lambda~\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}~\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
  math
where math\mu math is the shear  and math\lambda math is the 
theore the divergence of math\boldsymbol{\tau} math is given by
math
  \begin{align}
   \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} \equiv \cfrac{\partial s_{ij}}{\partial x_i} amp   
     \mu \left\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left\cfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+\cfrac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right\right + \lambda~\left\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_k}\right\right\delta_{ij} \\
    amp   \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial x_i\partial x_i} + \lambda~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_k}{\partial x_k\partial x_j} \\
    amp   \mu + \lambda~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial x_i^2} \\
    amp \equiv \mu + \lambda~\nabla\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} + \mu~\nabla^2\mathbf{u} ~
   \end{align}
  math
using the identity math\nabla^2\mathbf{u}   \nabla\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}   \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{u} math we have
math
  \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau}   2\mu + \lambda~\nabla\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}  
      \mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{u}~
   math
the equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as
math
   \rho \left\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right    \nabla p + 2\mu + \lambda~\nabla\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}  
      \mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{u} + \rho\mathbf{g}
  math
 
for most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational that is the  is zero  in that case
math
   \nabla\times\mathbf{u}   0
  math
and the momentum equation reduces to
math
   \rho \left\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right    \nabla p + 2\mu + \lambda~\nabla\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} + \rho\mathbf{g}
  math
 
another frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible  the momentum equation then further simplifies to
math
   \rho \left\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right    \nabla p + 2\mu + \lambda~\nabla\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}
  math
 
additionally if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium the bulk and shear viscosities are zero the momentum equation takes the form
math
   \rho \left\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right    \nabla p
  math
 
an important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small  this assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation  then we can express the variables as the sum of the time averaged mean field math\langle\cdot\rangle math that varies in space and a small fluctuating field math\tilde{\cdot} math that varies in space and time  that is
math
   p   \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~~~
   \rho   \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~~~
   \mathbf{u}   \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{u}}
  math
and
math
   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t}   0 ~~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t}   0 ~~~
   \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{u} \rangle}{\partial t}   \mathbf{0} ~
  math
then the momentum equation can be expressed as
math
   \left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right \left\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t}  + \left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right \cdot \nabla \left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right\right    \nabla \left\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right
  math
since the fluctuations are assumed to be small products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected to first order and we have
math
  \begin{align}
   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t} amp +
   \left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right+
   \langle\rho\rangle\left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +
     \tilde{\mathbf{u}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right \\
   amp    \nabla \left\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right
  \end{align}
  math
 
next we assume that the medium is homogeneous in the sense that the time averaged variables
math\langle p \rangle math and math\langle \rho \rangle math have zero gradients ie
math
  \nabla\langle p \rangle    0 ~~~ \nabla\langle \rho \rangle   0 ~
  math
the momentum equation then becomes
math
   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t} +
   \left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right+
   \langle\rho\rangle\left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +
     \tilde{\mathbf{u}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right
      \nabla\tilde{p}
  math
 
at this stage we assume that the medium is at rest which implies that the mean flow velocity is zero ie math\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle   0  math  then the balance of momentum reduces to
math
    \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t}    \nabla\tilde{p}
  math
dropping the tildes and using math\rho_0   \langle\rho\rangle math we get the commonly used form of the acoustic momentum equation
math
    \rho_0~\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla p   0 ~
  math
the equation for the  in a fluid volume without any mass sources or sinks is given by
math\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \rho \mathbf{u}   0 math
where math\rho\mathbf{x}t math is the mass density of the fluid and math\mathbf{u}\mathbf{x}t math is the flow velocity
the equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum
 
from the assumption of small disturbances we have
math
   p   \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~~~
   \rho   \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~~~
   \mathbf{u}   \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{u}}
  math
and
math
   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t}   0 ~~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t}   0 ~~~
   \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{u} \rangle}{\partial t}   \mathbf{0} ~
  math
then the mass balance equation can be written as
math
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\nabla \cdot\left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right +
   \nabla\left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\cdot \left\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right  0
   math
if we neglect higher than first order terms in the fluctuations the mass balance equation becomes
math
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +
    \nabla\left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+
    \nabla\langle\rho\rangle\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}}  0
   math
 
next we assume that the medium is homogeneous ie
math
  \nabla\langle \rho \rangle   0 ~
  math
then the mass balance equation takes the form
math
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +
    \nabla\tilde{\rho}\cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle
      0
   math
 
at this stage we assume that the medium is at rest ie math\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle   0  math  then the mass balance equation can be expressed as
math
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}}   0
   math
 
to close the system of equations we need an  for the pressure  to do that we assume that the medium is an  and all acoustic waves compress the medium in an  and  manner  the equation of state can then be expressed in the form of the differential equation
math
    \cfrac{dp}{d\rho}   \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~~~ \gamma   \cfrac{c_p}{c_v} ~~~ c^2   \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~
  math
where mathc_p math is the  at constant pressure mathc_v math is the  at constant volume and mathc math is the wave speed  the value of math\gamma math is 14 if the acoustic medium is air
for small disturbances
math
   \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} \approx \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}}  ~~~
   \cfrac{p}{\rho} \approx \cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~~~
   c^2 \approx c_0^2   \cfrac{\gamma~\langle p\rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~
  math
where mathc_0 math is the  in the medium
theore
math
   \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}}   \gamma~\cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle}
       c_0^2 \qquad \implies \qquad
   \cfrac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t}   c_0^2 \cfrac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t}
  math
the balance of mass can then be written as
math
  \cfrac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} +
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}}   0
   math
dropping the tildes and defining math\rho_0    \langle\rho\rangle math gives us the commonly used expression for the balance of mass in an acoustic medium
math
  \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \rho_0~c_0^2~\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}   0 ~
   math
if we use a  mathr\thetaz math with  math\mathbf{e}_r \mathbf{e}_\theta \mathbf{e}_z math then the  of mathp math and the  of math\mathbf{u} math are given by
math
   \begin{align}
     \nabla p amp   \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z \\
     \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} amp   \cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right + \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}
   \end{align}
  math
where the  has been expressed as math\mathbf{u}   u_r~\mathbf{e}_r+u_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta+u_z~\mathbf{e}_z math
the equations for the  may then be written as
math
   \rho_0~\left\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_r+\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_\theta+\cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_z\right +
\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z   0
  math
in terms of components these three equations for the  in  are
math
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}    0 ~~~
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial t} + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}    0 ~~~
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}    0 ~
  math
the equation for the  can similarly be written in  as
math
   \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa\left\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right + \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\right   0 ~
  math
the acoustic equations for the  and the  are often expressed in time  form at fixed   in that case the pressures and the flow velocity are assumed to be time harmonic functions of the form
math
   p\mathbf{x} t   \hat{p}\mathbf{x}~e^{ i\omega t} ~~~
   \mathbf{u}\mathbf{x} t   \hat{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{x}~e^{ i\omega t} ~~~ i   \sqrt{ 1}
  math
where math\omega math is the frequency  substitution of these expressions into the governing equations in  gives us the fixed frequency form of the 
math
   \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial r}   i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{u}_r ~~~
   \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial \theta}   i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{u}_\theta ~~~
    \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial z}   i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{u}_z
  math
and the fixed frequency form of the 
math
   \cfrac{i\omega \hat{p}}{\kappa}   \cfrac{\partial \hat{u}_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left\cfrac{\partial \hat{u}_\theta}{\partial \theta} + \hat{u}_r\right + \cfrac{\partial \hat{u}_z}{\partial z} ~
  math
 
in the special case where the field quantities are independent of the z coordinate we can eliminate mathu_r u_\theta math to get
math
   \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} +
     \frac{1}{r^2}~\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial\theta^2} + \frac{\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~p   0
  math
assuming that the solution of this equation can be written as
math
    pr\theta   rr~q\theta
  math
we can write the partial differential equation as
math
   \cfrac{r^2}{r}~\cfrac{d^2r}{dr^2} + \cfrac{r}{r}~\cfrac{dr}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}    \cfrac{1}{q}~\cfrac{d^2q}{d\theta^2}
  math
the left hand side is not a function of math\theta math while the right hand side is not a function of mathr math  hence
math
   r^2~\cfrac{d^2r}{dr^2} + r~\cfrac{dr}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~r   \alpha^2~r ~~~ \cfrac{d^2q}{d\theta^2}    \alpha^2~q
  math
where math\alpha^2 math is a constant  using the substitution
math
   \tilde{r} \leftarrow \left\omega\sqrt{\cfrac{\rho_0}{\kappa}}\right r   k~r
  math
we have
math
   \tilde{r}^2~\cfrac{d^2r}{d\tilde{r}^2} + \tilde{r}~\cfrac{dr}{d\tilde{r}} + \tilde{r}^2 \alpha^2~r   0 ~~~ \cfrac{d^2q}{d\theta^2}    \alpha^2~q
  math
the equation on the left is the  which has the general solution
math
   rr    a_\alpha~j_\alphak~r + b_\alpha~j_{ \alpha}k~r
  math
where mathj_\alpha math is the cylindrical  of the first kind and matha_\alpha b_\alpha math are undetermined constants  the equation on the right has the general solution
math
   q\theta   c_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + d_\alpha~e^{ i\alpha\theta}
  math
where mathc_\alphad_\alpha math are undetermined constants  then the solution of the acoustic wave equation is
math
   pr\theta   \lefta_\alpha~j_\alphak~r + b_\alpha~j_{ \alpha}k~r\right\leftc_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + d_\alpha~e^{ i\alpha\theta}\right
  math
boundary conditions are needed at this stage to determine math\alpha math and the other undetermined constants

alexander mackenzie  january 28 1822 – april 17 1892 was a building contractor and newspaper editor and was the   from november 7 1873 to october 8 1878
mackenzie was born in  perthshire  the son of mary stewart fleming and alexander mackenzie sr he was the third of ten children at the age of 13 mackenzies father died and he was forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family at the age of 20 he apprenticed as a stonemason and immigrated to  had canada in 1842 to seek a better life as well as to follow his sweetheart helen neil shortly thereafter he converted from  to  beliefs mackenzies faith was to link him to the increasingly influential  particularly strong in  where he lived a constituency of which he was to represent in the 
by age 20 
mackenzie married helen neil 1826–52 in 1845 and with her had three children with only one girl surviving infancy in 1853 he married  1825–93
 in canada mackenzie continued his career as a stonemason building many structures that still stand today he began working as a general contractor earning a reputation for being a hard working honest man as well as having a working mans view on fiscal policy
mackenzie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in canada he campaigned relentlessly for  owner of the  paper  in the 1851 election helping him to win a seat in the assembly in 1852 mackenzie became editor of another ormist paper the lambton shield as editor mackenzie was perhaps a little too vocal leading the paper to a suit of law for libel against the local conservative candidate the paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship mackenzie was elected to the legislative assembly as a supporter of george brown in 1861
when the  government fell due to the  in 1873 the   called upon mackenzie who had been chosen as the leader of the  a few months earlier to form a new government  mackenzie formed a government and asked the governor general to call an  the liberals won having garnered 538% of the popular vote the voter support of 538% remains the record in  for all federal electionsÉric grenier size of justin trudeaus government breaks records for better and worse biggest seat gains in canadas history delivered a majority government — with one of its smallest mandates dec 2 2015 http  wwwcbcca news politics grenier historical trudeau government 13344130  mackenzie remained prime minister until the  when macdonalds  returned to power with a

mackenzie also served as minister of public works and oversaw the completion of the parliament buildings while drawing up the plans he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building which allowed him to escape the patronage seekers waiting for him in his ante chamber proving dufferins lections on his character to be true mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics nevertheless he found it a necessary evil in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow liberals
 in keeping with his democratic ideals mackenzie used the offer of a knighthood three times and was thus the only one of canadas first eight prime ministers not to be knighted his pride in his working class origins never left him once while touring  as prime minister he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them the embarrassed escort confessed that he didnt and mackenzie replied i do it is five feet ten inches i know because i built it myselfcanadas prime ministers 1867 – 1994 biographies and anecdotes ottawa national archives of canada 1994 40 p

ashoka was born to the  emperor  and a relatively lower ranked wife of his  or dhammā he was the grandson of  founder of  the  texts mention that his mother was queen  according to  she was the daughter of a brahmin from the city of champa name john1989  though a palace intrigue kept her away from the emperor this eventually ended and she bore a son it is from her exclamation i am now without sorrow that ashoka got his name the  tells a similar story but gives the name of the queen as janapadakalyānī 
ashoka had several elder siblings all of whom were his half brothers from other wives of bindusara his fighting qualities were apparent from an early age and he was given royal military training  he was known as a fearsome hunter and according to a legend killed a lion with just a wooden rod because of his reputation as a frightening warrior and a heartless general he was sent to curb the riots in the  province of the mauryan empireprachin bharoter itihas by sunil chatterjee 
the buddhist text  describes ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers this may have been an incident in s times s account states that  bindusaras chief advisor destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas some historians consider this as an indication of bindusaras conquest of the deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt following this ashoka was stationed at ujjayini as governor
bindusaras death in 272 bce led to a war over succession according to the divyavadana bindusara wanted his son  to succeed him but ashoka was supported by his fathers ministers who found susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them name swarup1999  a minister named radhagupta seems to have played an important role in ashokas rise to the throne the ashokavadana recounts radhaguptas offering of an old royal elephant to ashoka for him to ride to the garden of the gold pavilion where king bindusara would determine his successor ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals radhagupta according to the ashokavadana would later be appointed prime minister by ashoka once he had gained the throne the  and  er to ashokas killing 99 of his brothers sparing only one named  or tissa although there is no clear proof about this incident many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements the  happened in 269 bce four years after his succession to the throne
buddhist legends state that ashoka was bad tempered and of a wicked nature he built  an elaborate  described as a paradisal hell due to the contrast between its beautiful exterior and the acts carried out within by his appointed executioner girikaa name pradip2002  this earned him the name of chanda ashoka  meaning ashoka the fierce in sanskrit professor charles drekmeier cautions that the buddhist legends tend to dramatise the change that buddhism brought in him and theore exaggerate ashokas past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion name charles1962 
ascending the throne ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years from the present day boundaries  in the east to  in the west from the  in afghanistan in the north to the peninsula of southern india except for present day  and  which were ruled by the three   kingdoms 
while the early part of ashokas reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty he became a follower of the s teachings after his conquest of  on the east coast of india in the present day states of  and north coastal  kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy with its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient bharata where there existed the concept of  rajdharma means the duty of the rulers which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma the kalinga war happened  eight years after his coronation from his 13th inscription we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence over 150000 were deportedprachin bharater itihas by sunil chattopadhyay  when he was walking through the grounds of kalinga after his conquest rejoicing in his victory he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the kith and kin of the dead
edict 13 on the  rock inscriptions lect the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of kalinga
 blockquotehis majesty feels remorse on account of the conquest of kalinga because during the subjugation of a previously unconquered country slaughter death and taking away captive of the people necessarily occur whereat his majesty feels profound sorrow and regret blockquote
the edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from ashokas understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too 
legend says that one day after the war was over ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses this sight made him sick and he cried the famous monologue 
blockquotewhat have i done if this is a victory whats a defeat then is this a victory or a defeat  is this justice or injustice is it gallantry or a rout is it valor to kill innocent children and women did i do it to widen the empire and for prosperity or to destroy the others kingdom and splendor  one has lost her husband someone else a father someone a child someone an unborn infant whats this debris of the corpses are these marks of victory or defeat are these vultures crows eagles the messengers of death or evil blockquote
the lethal war with kalinga transformed the vengeful emperor ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of buddhism whether or not he converted to buddhism is unclear   although buddhist tradition mentions so according to the prominent   ashokas personal religion became buddhism if not before then certainly after the kalinga war however according to basham the dharma officially propagated by ashoka was not buddhism at allthe wonder that was india  al basham page 56   notes that modern day historians question his conversion into buddhism in the aftermath of the kalinga war she argues that ashoka curiously rained from engraving his confession anywherethe penguin history of early india  romila thapar page 180 
nevertheless his patronage led to the expansion of buddhism in the mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule and worldwide from about 250 bce  prominent in this cause were his son  mahendra and daughter  whose name means friend of the sangha who established buddhism in ceylon now sri lanka 
archaeological evidence for buddhism between the death of the buddha and the time of ashoka is scarce after the time of ashoka it is abundant
ashoka ruled for an estimated forty years legend states that during his cremation his body burned for seven days and nights  after his death the mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the indian subcontinent ashoka had many wives and children but many of their names are lost to time his chief consort agramahisi for the majority of his reign was his wife  who apparently bore him no children name mookerji66 
in his old age he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife  it is said that she had got ashokas son  the regent in  and the heir presumptive to the throne blinded by a wily  the official executioners spared kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife  in  ashoka heard kunalas song and realised that kunalas misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself he condemned tishyaraksha to death restoring kunala to the court in the ashokavadana kunala is portrayed as forgiving tishyaraksha having obtained enlightenment through buddhist practice while he urges ashoka to forgive her as well ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness name pradip2002  kunala was succeeded by his son  who ruled for 50 years until his death
the reign of ashoka maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by had he not left behind records of his reign these records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name the language used for inscription was in one of the  common languages etched in a brahmi script
in the year 185 bce about fifty years after ashokas death the last maurya ruler  was assassinated by the commander in chief of the mauryan armed forces  while he was taking the guard of honor of his forces pushyamitra shunga founded the  185 75 bce and ruled just a fragmented part of the mauryan empire many of the northwestern territories of the mauryan empire modern day afghanistan and northern pakistan became the 
king ashoka the third monarch of the indian mauryan dynasty is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived 
 
 
one of the more enduring legacies of ashoka maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between buddhism and the state throughout theravada southeastern asia the model of rulership embodied by ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated in the  kingdom for instance under this model of buddhist kingship the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source but by supporting and earning the approval of the buddhist  following ashokas example kings established monasteries funded the construction of stupas and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha as ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign this development ultimately led to a close association in many southeast asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy an association that can still be seen today in the state supported  and the traditional role of the thai king as both a religious and secular leader ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner
according to the legends mentioned in the 2nd century ce text  ashoka was not non violent after adopting buddhism in one instance a non buddhist in  drew a picture showing the buddha bowing at the feet of  identified with  24th tirthankara of  on complaint from a buddhist devotee ashoka issued an order to arrest him and subsequently another order to kill all the s in pundravardhana around 18000 followers of the ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order name john1989  name beni2010  sometime later another nirgrantha follower in  drew a similar picture ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house name beni2010  he also announced an award of one  silver coin to anyone who brought him the head of a nirgrantha heretic according to ashokavadana as a result of this order his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd name john1989  these stories of persecutions of rival sects by ashoka appear to be a clear fabrication arising out of sectarian propaganda name steven2010  name lephuoc2010 
ashoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early british india but  contributed in the revelation of historical sources another important historian was british   who was director general of the  his main interests were  and  in addition to  and  sir  a british archaeologist and army engineer and often known as the father of the  unveiled heritage sites like the  stupa sarnath sanchi and the mahabodhi temple  a british archaeologist also exposed ashokan historical sources especially the 
information about the life and reign of ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of buddhist sources in particular the   story of ashoka written in the 2nd century and the two  chronicles of sri lanka the  and  provide most of the currently known information about ashoka additional information is contributed by the  whose authorship was finally attributed to the ashoka of buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts priyadarshi—he who regards everyone with affection as a title or additional name of ashoka maurya architectural remains of his period have been found at   which include an 80 pillar  hall
  the edicts of ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the  as well as boulders and cave walls made by ashoka during his reign these inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern day pakistan and india and represent the first tangible evidence of buddhism the edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of indian history offering more information about  ashokas proselytism moral precepts religious precepts and his notions of social and animal welfare name singh2012 
ampnbsp– the ashokavadana is a 2nd century ce text related to the legend of ashoka the legend was translated into chinese by  in 300 ce it is essentially a hinayana text and its world is that of mathura and north west india the emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks the  and setting up an ideal of religious life for the  the common man by telling appealing stories about religious exploits the most startling feature is that ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the kalinga war which is not even mentioned nor is there a word about his belonging to the maurya dynasty equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread buddhism in an uncompromising fashion the legend of veetashoka provides insights into ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known pali records name pradip2002 
  the mahavamsa great chronicle is a historical poem written in the  language of the kings of sri lanka it covers the period from the coming of king vijaya of  ancient odisha in 543 bce to the reign of king mahasena 334–361 as it often ers to the royal dynasties of india the mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the  it is very important in dating the consecration of ashoka
  the dwipavamsa or dweepavamsa ie chronicle of the island in pali is the oldest historical record of sri lanka the chronicle is believed to be compiled from  and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century ce king dhatusena 4th century had ordered that the dipavamsa be recited at the  festival held annually in anuradhapura
the use of buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of ashoka as well as the interpretations of his edicts building on traditional accounts early scholars regarded ashoka as a primarily buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the buddhist monastic institution some scholars have tended to question this assessment the only source of information not attributable to buddhist sources are the ashokan edicts and these do not explicitly state that ashoka was a buddhist in his edicts ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time    and ism and his edicts addressed to the population at large there are some addressed specifically to buddhists this is not the case for the other religions generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept
however there is strong evidence in the edicts alone that he was a buddhist in one edict he belittles rituals and he banned vedic animal sacrifices these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the vedic tradition for guidance furthermore there are many edicts expressed to buddhists alone in one ashoka declares himself to be an  and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with buddhist texts he erected rock pillars at buddhist holy sites but did not do so for the sites of other religions he also used the word  to er to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action this was an exclusively buddhist use of the word finally the ideals he promotes correspond to the first three steps of the buddhas graduated discourserichard robinson willard johnson and thanissaro bhikkhu buddhist religions fifth ed wadsworth 2005 page 59 
interestingly the ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar ashoka one in which his conversion does not have anything to do with the kalinga war or about his descent from the maurya dynasty instead ashokas reason for adopting non violence appears much more personal the ashokavadana shows that the main source of ashokas conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core from a wellspring inside himself not so much necessarily spurred by a specific event it thereby illuminates ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate with both greatness and flaws this ashoka is very different from the shadowy do gooder of later pali chronicles name pradip2002 
much of the knowledge about ashoka comes from the  that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire all his inscriptions present him as compassionate  and loving in the kalinga rock edits he addresses his people as his children and mentions that as a father he desires their good name vensdhammika_1993  these inscriptions promoted buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to  duty or proper behaviour and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might one also gets some primary information about the kalinga war and ashokas allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration the ashoka pillar at  is the most notable of the relics left by ashoka made of sandstone this pillar records the visit of the emperor to sarnath in the 3rd century bce it has a four lion capital four lions standing back to back which was adopted as the emblem of the modern indian republic the lion symbolises both ashokas imperial rule and the kingship of the  in translating these monuments historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the mauryan empire it is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened but the stone etchings clearly depict how ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered
recently scholarly analysis  determined that the three major foci of debate regarding ashoka involve the nature of the maurya empire the extent and impact of ashokas pacifism and what is erred to in the inscriptions as dhamma or  which connotes goodness virtue and charity some historians have argued that ashokas pacifism undermined the military backbone of the maurya empire while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been grossly exaggerated the dhamma of the edicts has been understood as concurrently a buddhist lay ethic a set of politico moral ideas a sort of universal religion or as an ashokan innovation on the other hand it has also been interpreted as an essentially political ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the edicts particularly in regard to imperial vision and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a virtually subcontinental and culturally and economically highly variegated 3rd century bce indian empire nonetheless it remains clear that ashokas inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the indian subcontinent and theore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices 
according to indian historian romila thapar ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers harmonious relationship between parents and children teachers and pupils and employers and employeesmicrosoft encarta article on ashoka  ashokas religion contained gleanings from all religions he emphasized on the virtues of ahimsa respect to all religious teachers equal respect for and study of each others scriptures and on rational faith
as a  emperor ashoka believed that  is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants so he built a number of     and residences for buddhist monks all over south asia and central asia according to the ashokavadana he ordered the construction of 84000 stupas to house the buddhas relics  in the aryamanjusrimulakalpa ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals  he gave donations to viharas and s he sent his only daughter  and son  to spread buddhism in sri lanka then known as tamraparni ashoka also sent many prominent buddhist monks bhikshus sthaviras like madhyamik sthavira to modern  and afghanistan maharaskshit sthavira to syria    iran egypt greece italy and turkey massim sthavira to nepal bhutan china and mongolia sohn uttar sthavira to modern cambodia laos burma old name suvarnabhumi for burma and thailand thailand and vietnam mahadhhamarakhhita stahvira to  old name maharatthha maharakhhit sthavira and yavandhammarakhhita sthavira to 
ashoka also invited buddhists and non buddhists for religious conferences he inspired the buddhist monks to compose the  sacred religious texts and also gave all types of help to that end ashoka also helped to develop viharas intellectual hubs such as  and  ashoka helped to construct   and  ashoka also gave donations to non buddhists as his reign continued his even handedness was replaced with special inclination towards buddhismnv isaeva shankara and indian philosophy suny press 1993 page 24  ashoka helped and respected both sramans buddhists monks and brahmins vedic monks ashoka also helped to organise the  c 250 bce at pataliputra todays  it was conducted by the monk  who was the spiritual teacher of the mauryan emperor ashoka
it is well known that ashoka sent dütas or emissaries to convey messages or letters written or oral rather both to various people the vith rock edict about oral orders reveals this it was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones and the content of ashokas messages can be inferred likewise from the xiiith rock edict they were meant to spread his dhammavijaya which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere including far beyond india there is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the kharosthi script and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script as  influence is seen in some of the formulations used by ashoka in his inscriptions this indicates to us that ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls name hinuber2012 
in his edicts ashoka mentions some of the people living in  as converts to buddhism although no hellenic historical record of this event remains
it is not too far fetched to imagine however that ashoka received letters from greek rulers and was acquainted with the hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the achaemenid kings given the presence of ambassadors of hellenistic kings in india as well as the dütas sent by ashoka himself name hinuber2012 
the greeks in india even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of buddhism as some of the emissaries of ashoka such as  are described in  sources as leading greek  buddhist monks active in spreading buddhism the  xii name   plgotwfull text of the mahavamsa http  lakdivaorg mahavamsa chaptershtml click chapter xii 
ashokas military power was strong but after his conversion to buddhism he maintained friendly relations with three major  kingdoms in the south namely   and  the post alexandrian empire  and  his  state that he made provisions for medical treatment of humans and animals in his own kingdom as well as in these neighbouring states he also had wells dug and trees planted along the roads for the benefit of the common people name vensdhammika_1993http  wwwcscolostateedu ~malaiya ashokahtml the edicts of king ashoka english translation 1993 by  ven s dhammika isbn 955 24 0104 6 retrieved on 21 february 2009 
ashokas rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good and no animal should be sacrificed for slaughter however he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating 
he imposed a ban on killing of all four footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible and of specific animal species including several birds certain types of fish and bulls among others he also banned killing of female goats sheep and pigs that were nursing their young as well as their young upto the age of six months he also banned killing of all fish and  of animals during certain periods such as  and   
ashoka also abolished the royal hunting of animals and restricted the slaying of animals for food in the royal residence name geraldmichael1998  because he banned hunting created many veterinary clinics and eliminated meat eating on many holidays the mauryan empire under ashoka has been described as one of the very few instances in world history of a government treating its animals as citizens who are as deserving of its protection as the human residents 
the  the wheel of ashoka is a depiction of the  the wheel of dharma the wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 laws of dependent origination and the 12 laws of dependent termination the ashoka chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the  emperor most prominent among which is the lion capital of  and the  the most visible use of the ashoka chakra today is at the centre of the national flag of the republic of india adopted on 22 july 1947 where it is rendered in a navy blue color on a white background by replacing the symbol of charkha  of the pre independence versions of the flag the ashoka chakra can also been seen on the base of lion capital of ashoka which has been adopted as the national emblem of india
the ashoka chakra was built by ashoka during his reign  is a  word which also means cycle or self repeating process the process it signifies is the cycle of time  as in how the world changes with time
a few days before india became independent on august 1947 the specially formed  decided that the  must be acceptable to all parties and communities name fotw  a flag with three colours saffron white and green with the ashoka chakra was selected
the pillars of ashoka are a series of columns dispersed throughout the northern indian subcontinent and erected by ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century bce originally there must have been many pillars of ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive averaging between forty and fifty feet in height and weighing up to fifty tons each all the pillars were quarried at chunar just south of varanasi and dragged sometimes hundreds of miles to where they were erected the first pillar of ashoka was found in the 16th century by thomas coryat in the ruins of ancient delhi the wheel represents the sun time and buddhist law while the  stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil
    commented out    
the lion capital of ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back to back it was originally placed atop the ashoka pillar at  now in the state of  india the pillar sometimes called the ashoka column is still in its original location but the lion capital is now in the  this lion capital of ashoka from sarnath has been adopted as the national emblem of india and the wheel  from its base was placed onto the center of the 
the capital contains four lions indian   asiatic lions standing back to back mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant a galloping horse a bull and a lion separated by intervening spoked chariot wheels over a bell shaped lotus carved out of a single block of polished sandstone the capital was believed to be crowned by a wheel of dharma dharmachakra popularly known in india as the ashoka chakra
the ashoka lion capital or the sarnath lion capital is also known as the national symbol of india the sarnath pillar bears one of the edicts of ashoka an inscription against division within the buddhist community which reads no one shall cause division in the order of monks the sarnath pillar is a column surmounted by a capital which consists of a canopy representing an inverted bell shaped lotus flower a short cylindrical abacus with four 24 spoked dharma wheels with four animals an elephant a bull a horse a lion
the four animals in the sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of lord s life
 the elephant represents the buddhas idea in erence to the dream of queen maya of a white elephant entering her womb
 the bull represents desire during the life of the buddha as a prince
 the horse represents buddhas departure from palatial life
 the lion represents the accomplishment of buddha
besides the religious interpretations there are some non religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the ashoka capital pillar at sarnath according to them the four lions symbolise ashokas rule over the four directions the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule chakravartin and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of india

the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical geographical and political context in which it is used american is derived from america a term originally denoting all of the  also called the  in some expressions it retains this pan american sense but its usage has evolved over time and for various historical reasons the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america
in modern english  generally ers to residents of the united states among native english speakers this usage is almost universal with any other use of the term requiring specification name wilson https  webarchiveorg web 20080316032628 http  wwwbartlebycom 68 37 337html view at bartleby  however this default use has been the source of complaint by some residents of latin america who feel that using the term solely for the united states misappropriates it name mencken  name gage  they argue instead that american should be broadened to include people from anywhere in north or south america not just the united states these critics admit their proposed usage is uncommon
the word can be used as both a  and an  in adjectival use it is generally understood to mean of or relating to the united states for example  was an american singer or the american president gave a speech today in noun form it generally means  the noun is rarely used in  to er to people not connected to the united states name wilson  when used with a  the adjective american can mean of or relating to the americas as in n or  less frequently the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier as in  dialects and pronunciation differ by country or the name of the  a third use of the term pertains specifically to the  for instance in the 16th century many americans died from imported diseases during the european conquest
       and  speakers may use cognates of american to er to inhabitants of the americas or to us nationals they generally have other terms specific to us nationals such as the german  name de dict  french  name french etatsunien  japanese  name jap dict detail  arabic   as opposed to   and italian  name dict it  these specific terms may be less common than the term american name french etatsunien  
in french   or  from  united states of america is a rarely used word that distinguishes us things and persons from the adjective  which denotes persons and things from the united states but may also er to the americas name french etatsunien  
likewise germans use of  and  name de dict   observe said cultural distinction solely denoting us things and people note that these are politically correct terms and that in normal parlance the adjective american and its direct cognates are almost always used unless the context does not render the nationality of the person clear
this differentiation is prevalent in german speaking countries as indicated by the  of the  one of the leading german language newspapers in switzerland which dismisses the term  as both ′unnecessary′ and ′artificial′ and recommends replacing it with amerikanischvademecum der sprachlich technische leitfaden der «neuen zürcher zeitung» 13th edition verlag neue zürcher zeitung zürich 2013 p 102 s v us amerikanisch  the respective guidelines of the foreign ministries of austria germany and switzerland all prescribe amerikaner and amerikanisch in erence to the united states for official usage making no mention of  or eidgenössisches departement für auswärtige angelegenheiten http  wwwedaadminch etc medialib downloads edazen topics intla cintlapar0011filetmp lt_080506_statenames_depdf „liste der staatenbezeichnungen“ bundesministerium für europäische und internationale angelegenheiten http  wwwbmeiagvat fileadmin user_upload oracle staatennamen_depdf „liste der staatennamen und deren ableitungen in den vom bundesministerium für europäische und internationale angelegenheiten verwendeten formen“ auswärtiges amt http  wwwauswaertiges amtde cae servlet contentblob 332368 publicationfile 3097 staatennamenpdf „verzeichnis der staatennamen für den amtlichen gebrauch in der bundesrepublik deutschland“ 
portuguese has  denoting both a person or thing from the americas and a us national name pt americano  for erring specifically to a us national and things some words used are  also spelled  united states person from  and  yankee—both usages exist in brazil but are uncommon in portugal—but the term most often used and the only one in portugal is  even though it could as with its spanish equivalent apply to canadians mexicans etc as well
in spanish  denotes geographic and cultural origin in the new world as well as infrequently a us citizen name rae americano   the more common term is  united states person which derives from  united states of america the spanish term  north american is frequently used to er things and persons from the united states but this term can also denote people and things from canada mexico and the rest of  name rae estadosunidos 
in other languages however there is no possibility for confusion for example the  word for us national   name zh dict us natural  is derived from a word for the united states  where  is an abbreviation for yàměilìjiā america and  is country name zh dict us  name zh dict america  name zh dict country  the name for the american continent is  from  plus  continent name zh dict continent  thus a  is an american in the continent sense and a  is an american in the us sense
conversely in  there is no possibility for disambiguation  m and  f can er to persons from the united states or from the continent of america and there is no specific word capable of distinguishing the two meanings for this reason the latter meaning is very rarely used and word američanka is used almost exclusively to er to persons from the us the usage is exactly parallel to the english word
 and  also use unambiguous terms with korean having   for the country versus   for the continent name ko dict america  and vietnamese having  for the country versus  for the continent  has such terms as well   versus   but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech where  predominates
in   means specifically the united states and  is a us national whereas the international form  ers to the continent and  would be an inhabitants thereof    likewise the  word  ers to the continent for the country there is the term  thus a citizen of the united states is an  whereas an  is an inhabitant of the americas

16th century european usage of american denoted the native inhabitants of the new world name oed   the earliest recorded use of this term in english is in s 1568 translation of s book  thévet himself had erred to the natives as ameriques name oed  in the following century the term was extended to european settlers and their descendants in the americas the earliest recorded use of this term in english dates to 1648 in s the english american a new survet of the west indies name oed

the term american however applied as a noun to the citizens of the newly independent colonies was not yet in general usage in fact it was british officials who first called the colonists “americans” when the drafters of the declaration —  from virginia for example or  from massachusetts — talked about “my country” they meant virginia or massachusetts respectively this situation was changed by the revolution and the impulse toward nationalism 2015 http  wwwnybookscom articles archives 2015 jul 09 different story what shaped america  “a different story of what shaped america”  july 9 issue   jefferson newly elected president in may 1801 wrote i am sure the measures i mean to pursue are such as would in their nature be approved by every american who can emerge from preconceived prejudices as for those who cannot we must take care of them as of the sick in our hospitals the medicine of time and fact may cure some of themletter tj to theodore foster may 1801 in paul leicester ford ed the works of thomas jefferson 1905 850

ada is a     and     extended from  and other languages it has built in language support for  extremely strong typing explicit concurrency offering tasks synchronous message passing protected objects and  ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors ada is an international standard the current version known as ada 2012  is defined by iso iec 86522012 name iso_iec_8652_2012 
ada was originally designed by a team led by  of  under contract to the  dod from 1977 to 1983 to supersede the hundreds of programming languages then used by the dod  ada was named after  1815–1852 who is credited as being the first computer programmerj fuegi and j francis lovelace amp babbage and the creation of the 1843 notes annals of the history of computing 25 #4 october–december 2003 16 26  
ada was originally targeted at  and  systems the adaampnbsp95 revision designed by  of  between 1992 and 1995 improved support for systems numerical financial and  oop
notable features of ada include   packages    synchronous   and nondeterministic   and  adaampnbsp95 added support for  including 
the syntax of ada minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations and pers english keywords such as or else and and then to symbols such as    and ampamp ada uses the basic arithmetical operators +    and   but avoids using other symbols code blocks are delimited by words such as declare begin and end where the end in most cases is followed by the identifier of the block it closes eg if … end if loop … end loop in the case of conditional blocks this avoids a  that could pair with the wrong nested if expression in other languages like c or java
ada is designed for development of very large software systems ada packages can be compiled separately  ada package specifications the package interface can also be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency  this makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase before implementation starts
a large number of compile time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code  for example the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens the adherence to strong typing allows detection of many common software errors wrong parameters range violations invalid erences mismatched types etc either during compile time or otherwise during run time as concurrency is part of the language specification the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers visibility of packages redundant declarations etc and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error
ada also supports run time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory  errors range violations s array access errors and other detectable bugs these checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency but can often be compiled efficiently it also includes facilities to help program verification for these reasons ada is widely used in critical systems where any  might lead to very serious consequences eg accidental death injury or severe financial loss examples of systems where ada is used include   railways banking military and space technology  name ada_usage 
adas dynamic  is high level and type safe  ada does not have generic or untyped  nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type  instead all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must take place through explicitly declared access types
each access type has an associated storage pool that handles the low level details of memory management the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones this is particularly relevant for   it is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools
also the language provides for accessibility checks both at compile time and at run time that ensures that an access value cannot outlive the type of the object it points to
though the semantics of the language allow automatic  of inaccessible objects most implementations do not support it by default as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real time systems  ada does support a limited form of  also creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool
ada was designed to resemble the english language in its syntax for  a double     resembling an  denotes comment text  comments stop at end of line so there is no danger of unclosed comments accidentally voiding whole sections of source code  pixing each line or column with    will skip all that code while being clearly denoted as a column of repeated    down the page there is no limit to the nesting of comments thereby allowing prior code with commented out sections to be commented out as even larger sections  all  characters are allowed in comments such as for symbolic formulas e0 m×c² to the compiler the double dash is treated as end of line allowing continued parsing of the language as a 
the semicolon  is a  and the null or no operation statement is codenull code a single code code without a statement to terminate is not allowed
unlike most  standards the ada language definition known as the ada reference manual or arm or sometimes the language reference manual or lrm is  thus it is a common erence for ada programmers and not just programmers implementing ada compilers apart from the erence manual there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs this document is also widely used by programmers when the language was revised a new rationale document was written
one notable  tool that is used by many ada programmers to aid them in writing ada source code is the 
in the 1970s the  dod was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects many of which were obsolete or hardware dependent and none of which supported safe modular programming in 1975 a  the  holwg was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the departments and uk ministry of defence requirements after many iterations beginning with an original  the eventual programming language was named ada the total number of high level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996
 the holwg working group crafted the  a series of documents stating the requirements they felt a programming language should satisfy many existing languages were formally reviewed but the team concluded in 1977 that no existing language met the specifications
requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of red  led by  green  led by  blue  led by john goodenough  and yellow  led by    though intermetrics and bull have previous links i am including them for parallelism    in april 1978 after public scrutiny the red and green proposals passed to the next phase in may 1979 the green proposal designed by jean ichbiah at cii honeywell bull was chosen and given the name ada—after  this proposal was influenced by the programming language  that ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s the preliminary ada erence manual
was published in acm sigplan notices in june 1979 the military standard erence manual was approved on december 10 1980 s birthday and
given the number mil std 1815 in honor of ada lovelaces birth year in 1981  took advantage of his  speech to criticize ada for being overly complex and hence unreliablecar hoare http  zoocsyaleedu classes cs422 2011 bib hoare81emperorpdf the emperors old clothes communications of the acm 1981  but subsequently seemed to recant in the foreword he wrote for an ada textbookda watt ba wichmann and w findlay ada language and methodology prentice hall 1987 
ada attracted much attention from the programming community as a whole during its early days  its backers and others predicted that it might become a dominant language for general purpose programming and not just defense related work  ichbiah publicly stated that within ten years only two programming languages would remain ada and  name sigada rosenj p rosen the ada paradoxes ada letters acm sigada vol 24 no 2 august 2009 pp 28 35   early ada compilers struggled to implement the large complex language and both compile time and run time performance tended to be slow and tools primitive  compiler vendors expended most of their efforts in passing the massive language conformance testing government required acvc validation suite that was required in another novel feature of the ada language effort name sigada rosen  
the first validated ada implementation was the nyu ada ed translator  certified on april 11 1983 nyu ada ed is implemented in the high level set language    a number of commercial companies began offering ada compilers and associated development tools including        and others 
in 1991 the us department of defense began to require the use of ada the ada mandate for all software  though exceptions to this rule were often granted  the department of defense ada mandate was effectively removed in 1997 as the dod began to embrace   technology similar requirements existed in other  countries
by the late 1980s and early 1990s ada compilers had improved in performance but there were still barriers to full exploitation of adas abilities including a tasking model that was different from what most real time programmers were used to name sigada rosen  
because of adas  support features it is now used not only for military applications but also in commercial projects where a software bug can have severe consequences eg  and  commercial rockets eg  s and other space systems railway transport and banking name ada_usage  
for example the  the  system software in the  was written in ada developed by  in collaboration with consultants from  it became arguably the best known of any ada project civilian or military  also at http  deliveryacmorg 101145 1040000 1035608 p28 wolfepdf  the canadian automated air traffic system was written in 1 million lines of ada  count it featured advanced distributed processing a distributed ada database and object oriented design ada is also used in other air traffic systems eg the uk’s next generation interim future area control tools support ifacts air traffic control system is designed and implemented using  ada 
it is also used in the   in  system on the  high speed rail system and the metro suburban trains in paris london hong kong and new york city name ada_usage   
the language became an  standard in 1983 http  archiveadaiccom standards 83lrm html welcomehtml ansi mil std 1815a and without any further changes became
an  in 1987 iso 86521987 this version of the language is commonly known as adaampnbsp83 from the date of its adoption by ansi but is sometimes erred to also as adaampnbsp87 from the date of its adoption by iso
adaampnbsp95 the joint iso ansi standard http  wwwadaicorg standards 95lrm html rm ttlhtml iso 86521995 was published in february 1995 making adaampnbsp95 the first iso standard object oriented programming language to help with the standard revision and future acceptance the  funded the development of the   presently the gnat compiler is part of the 
work has continued on improving and updating the technical content of the ada programming language a technical corrigendum to adaampnbsp95 was published in october 2001 and a major amendment http  wwwisoorg iso en cataloguedetailpagecataloguedetailcsnumber 45001 iso iec 86521995 amd 12007 was published on march 9 2007 at the ada europe 2012 conference in stockholm the ada resource association ara and ada europe announced the completion of the design of the latest version of the ada programming language and the submission of the erence manual to the international organization for standardization iso for approval iso iec 86522012 was published in december 2012 name iso_iec_8652_2012  
other related standards include  31988 information processing systems—computer graphics—graphical kernel system gks language bindings—part 3 ada
ada is an  like programming language featuring control structures with reserved words such as if then else while for and so on however ada also has many data structuring facilities and other abstractions which were not included in the original  such as     such constructs were in part inherited or inspired from 
a common example of a languages  is the 
helloadb
syntaxhighlight lang ada
with adatext_io use adatext_io
procedure hello is
begin
  put_line hello world
end hello
 syntaxhighlight
this program can be compiled by using the freely available open source compiler  by executing
syntaxhighlight lang bashgnatmake helloadb syntaxhighlight
adas type system is not based on a set of predefined  but allows users to declare their own types this declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved this allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time ie range violations buffer overruns type consistency etc ada supports numerical types defined by a range modulo types aggregate types records and arrays and enumeration types access types define a erence to an instance of a specified type untyped pointers are not permitted
special types provided by the language are task types and protected types
for example a date might be represented as
syntaxhighlight lang ada
type day_type   is range    1    31
type month_type is range    1    12
type year_type  is range 1800  2100
type hours is mod 24
type weekday is monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday
type date is
   record
     day    day_type
     month  month_type
     year   year_type
   end record
 syntaxhighlight
types can be ined by declaring subtypes
syntaxhighlight lang ada
subtype working_hours is hours range 0  12               at most 12 hours to work a day
subtype working_day is weekday range monday  friday      days to work
work_load constant arrayworking_day of working_hours     implicit type declaration
     friday   6 monday   4 others   10              lookup table for working hours with initialization
 syntaxhighlight
types can have modifiers such as limited abstract private etc private types can only be accessed and limited types can only be modified or copied within the scope of the package that defines them 
ada 95 adds additional features for object oriented extension of types
ada is a  language meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard statements all standard constructs and deep level early exit are supported so the use of the also supported  commands is seldom needed
syntaxhighlight lang ada
   while a is not equal to b loop
while a    b loop

packages procedures and functions can nest to any depth and each can also be the logical outermost block
each package procedure or function can have its own declarations of constants types variables and other procedures functions and packages which can be declared in any order
ada has language support for task based concurrency the fundamental concurrent unit in ada is a task which is a built in limited type tasks are specified in two parts – the task declaration defines the task interface similar to a type declaration the task body specifies the implementation of the task
depending on the implementation ada tasks are either mapped to operating system tasks or processes or are scheduled internally by the ada runtime
tasks can have entries for synchronisation a form of  task entries are declared in the task specification each task entry can have one or more accept statements within the task body if the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task similarly a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement task entries can have parameters similar to procedures allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data in conjunction with select statements it is possible to define guards on accept statements similar to dijkstras 
ada also offers s for  protected objects are a  construct but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling similar to conditional critical regions protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors and entry guards from conditional critical regions  the main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics like tasks the protected object is a built in limited type and it also has a declaration part and a body
a protected object consists of encapsulated private data which can only be accessed from within the protected object and procedures functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive with the only exception of functions which are required to be side effect free and can theore run concurrently with other functions a task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object and released when this other task leaves the protected object blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival
protected object entries are similar to procedures but additionally have guards if a guard evaluates to false a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry now another task can be admitted to the protected object as no task is currently executing inside the protected object guards are re evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed
calls to entries can be requeued to other entries with the same signature a task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task
the select statement in ada can be used to implement non blocking entry calls and accepts non deterministic selection of entries also with guards time outs and aborts
the following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in ada

controversy over arianism arose in the late 3rd century and persisted throughout most of the 4th century it involved most church members—from simple believers priests and monks to bishops emperors and members of romes imperial family two roman emperors  and  became arians or semi arians as did prominent   and  warlords both before and after the fall of the western roman empire such a deep controversy within the church during this period of its development could not have materialized without significant historical influences providing a basis for the arian doctrines name hanson2007  of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the  only two bishops did not sign the  which condemned arianism  this majority due at least in part to a pentaly of exile or death for usal to sign the nicene creed having been imposed by emperor constantius ii

reconstructing what arius actually taught and why is a formidable task both because little of his own work survives except in quotations selected for polemical purposes by his opponents and also because there is no certainty about what theological and philosophical traditions formed his thoughtrichard bauckham “review of arius heresy and tradition by rowan williams” themelios volume 14 no 2 january february 1989 1989 75

a letter from  c 250–336 to the arian  died 341 succinctly states the core beliefs of the arians
in 321 arius was denounced by a  at alexandria for teaching a heterodox view of the relationship of jesus to god the father because arius and his followers had great influence in the schools of alexandria—counterparts to modern universities or seminaries—their theological views spread especially in the eastern mediterranean

constantine is believed to have exiled those who used to accept the nicean creed—arius himself the deacon  and the libyan bishops  and —and also the bishops who signed the creed but used to join in condemnation of arius eusebius of nicomedia and  the emperor also ordered all copies of the thalia the book in which arius had expressed his teachings to be  however there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor  who was an arian christian was exiled
although he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at nicaea constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council first he allowed eusebius of nicomedia who was a protégé of his sister and theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith the two and other friends of arius worked for ariuss rehabilitation at the  in ad 335 they brought accusations against  bishop of alexandria the primary opponent of arius after this constantine had athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation in the same year the synod of jerusalem under constantines direction readmitted  to communion in ad 336 arius however died on the way to this event in constantinople some scholars suggest that arius may have been poisoned by his opponentsedward gibbons the decline and fall of the roman empire chapter 21 1776–88 jonathan kirsch god against the gods the history of the war between monotheism and polytheism 2004 and   the rise of faith and the fall of reason 2002   eusebius and theognis remained in the emperors favor and when constantine who had been a  much of his adult life accepted  on his deathbed it was from eusebius of nicomedia 
the council of nicaea did not end the controversy as many bishops of the eastern provinces disputed the  the central term of the nicene creed as it had been used by  who had advocated a   both the man and his teaching including the term homoousios had been condemned by the  in 269
hence after constantines death in 337 open dispute resumed again constantines son  who had become emperor of the eastern part of the empire actually encouraged the arians and set out to reverse the nicene creed his advisor in these affairs was eusebius of nicomedia who had already at the council of nicea been the head of the arian party who also was made bishop of constantinople
constantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the nicene creed especially st  who fled to rome in 355 constantius became the sole emperor and extended his pro arian policy toward the western provinces frequently using force to push through his creed even exiling  and installing 
as debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula three camps evolved among the opponents of the nicene creed the first group mainly opposed the nicene terminology and perred the term homoiousios alike in substance to the nicene homoousios while they rejected arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and coeternality of the persons of the trinity because of this centrist position and despite their rejection of arius they were called semi arians by their opponents the second group also avoided invoking the name of arius but in large part followed arius teachings and in another attempted compromise wording described the son as being like  the father a third group explicitly called upon arius and described the son as unlike  the father constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party while harshly persecuting the third
the debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods among them the  in 343 the  in 358 and the double  and seleucia in 359 and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360 leading the pagan observer  to comment sarcastically the highways were covered with galloping bishops none of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of nicene orthodoxy writing about the latter councils saint  remarked that the world awoke with a groan to find itself arian
after constantius death in 361 his successor  a devotee of  declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another and allowed all exiled bishops to return this resulted in further increasing dissension among christians the emperor  however revived constantius policy and supported the homoian party exiling bishops and often using force during this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the empire eg  to the eastern provinces these contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the western supporters of the nicene creed and the homoousios and the eastern semi arians
it was not until the co reigns of gratian and theodosius that arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the eastern empire theodosius wife st  was instrumental in his campaign to end arianism valens died in the  in 378 and was succeeded by  who adhered to the nicene creed this allowed for settling the dispute
two days after theodosius arrived in constantinople 24 november 380 he expelled the  bishop  and surrendered the churches of that city to  the leader of the rather small nicene community there an act which provoked rioting theodosius had just been baptized by bishop acholius of thessalonica during a severe illness as was common in the early christian world in february he and  had published an edict  that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of rome and alexandria ie the nicene faith or be handed over for punishment for not doing so
although much of the church hierarchy in the east had opposed the nicene creed in the decades leading up to theodosius accession he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the nicene creed in 381 at the  in constantinople a group of mainly eastern bishops assembled and accepted the the text of this version of the  is available at   which was supplemented in regard to the  as well as some other changes see  this is generally considered the end of the dispute about the trinity and the end of arianism among the roman non germanic peoples
 labelled the party of  in 358  this is considered unfair by kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective homoousios while others had moved in that direction after the out and out arians had come into the openkelly jnd early christian doctrines aampg black 1965 p 249 
during the time of arianisms flowering in  the gothic convert  later the subject of the letter of auxentius cited above was sent as a missionary to the gothic barbarians across the  a mission favored for political reasons by emperor constantius ii ulfilas initial success in converting this germanic people to an arian form of christianity was strengthened by later events when the germanic peoples entered the  and founded successor kingdoms in the western part most had been arian christians for more than a century
the conflict in the 4th century ad had seen arian and nicene factions struggling for control of the church in contrast in the arian german kingdoms established on the wreckage of the western roman empire in the 5th century there were entirely separate arian and nicene churches with parallel hierarchies each serving different sets of believers the germanic elites were arians and the romance majority population was nicene many scholars see the persistence of germanic arianism as a strategy that was followed in order to differentiate the germanic elite from the local inhabitants and their culture and also to maintain the germanic elites separate group identity
most germanic tribes were generally tolerant of the nicene beliefs of their subjects however the vandals tried for several decades to force their arian beliefs on their north african nicene subjects exiling nicene clergy dissolving monasteries and exercising heavy pressure on non conforming christians
by the beginning of the 8th century these kingdoms had either been conquered by nicene neighbors ostrogoths vandals burgundians or their rulers had accepted nicene christianity visigoths lombards

however much of southeastern europe and  including many of the  and  respectively had embraced arianism the  converted to arian christianity in 376 which led to arianism being a religious factor in various wars in the roman empire  in the west organized arianism survived in  in hispania and parts of italy until it was finally suppressed in the 6th and 7th centuries   662–671 and his young son and successor  671 were the last arian kings in europe

a similar view was held by the ancient anti nicene    “breath” or “spirit” and “fighters” combining as “fighters against the spirit” so called because they opposed the deifying of the nicene holy ghost however the pneumatomachi were adherents of  and though their beliefs were somewhat reminiscent of arianism name wacewace henry piercy william c eds dictionary of christian biography and literature to the end of the sixth century 1911 third edition london john murray  they were distinct enough to be distinguishably different name wace

by this scheme verus who was already hadrians adoptive grandson through his natural father remained hadrians adoptive son through his new father  the adoption of marcus aurelius was probably a suggestion of antoninus himself since the former was the nephew of the latters wife and would be his favorite son

that this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need is proved by the fact that although generally peaceful antoninus reign was not free from attempts of usurpation  mentions two made by senators cornelius priscianus by the way lollius urbicus successor as governor of britain and atilius rufius titianus   both confirmed by the  as well as by the erasing of priscianus name on an inscription albino garzetti from tiberius to the antonines a history of the roman empire ad 14 192 london routledge 2014 isbn 978 1 138 01920 1  page 447  lempire gréco romain paris seuil 2005 isbn 2 02 057798 4 page 28 footnote 61 salway 149  in both cases antoninus was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression priscianus committed suicide and titianus was found guilty by the senate with antoninus abstaining from sequestering their families propertiesmarta garcía morcillo las ventas por subasta en el mundo romano la esfera privada edicions universitat barcelona 2005 isbn 84 475 3017 5  page 301 
there were also some troubles in  which required the granting of additional powers to the  governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province name bowman pg 155bowman pg 155  also during his reign the governor of  probably caius popillius carus pedo built new fortifications in the  advancing the  fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring birley pg 113 
nevertheless antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving italy once during his reignspeidel michael p riding for caesar the roman emperors horse guards harvard university press 1997 pg 50 canduci pg 40  but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as ephesus of which some were publicly displayed this style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generationssee victor 153 
antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder in spite of an extensive building directive   the free access of the people of rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts not only in rome but throughout the empire as well as bridges and roads   the emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasure of around two and a half million sesterzi
the emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters such as when fires struck rome and narbona and earthquakes affected  and the  he offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various greek cities after two serious earthquakes the first circa 140 which affected mostly rhodes and other islands the second in 152 which hit    where the huge and newly built temple to hadrian was destroyedbarbara burrell neokoroi greek cities and roman emperors leiden brill 2004 isbn 90 04 12578 7 page  87     and  antoninus financial help earned him praise by greek writers such as  and pausaniasee bryant the reign of antoninus pius cambridge university press 1895 pages 45 46 and 68  these cities received from antoninus the usual honorific accolades such as when he commended that all governors of asia should enter the province when taking office by way of ephesusconrad gempf ed the book of acts in its graeco roman setting grand rapids wm b eerdmans publishing 1994 isbn 0 85364 564 7  page 305 
in his dealings with greek speaking cities antoninus followed the policy adopted by hadrian of ingratiating himself with local elites specially with local intellectuals philosophers teachers of literature rhetoricians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties envolving private spending for civic purposes   a privilege granted by hadrian that antoninus confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the  27168 philip a harland ed greco roman associations texts translations and commentaries ii north coast of the black sea asia minor  berlin walter de gruyter 2014 isbn 978 3 11 034014 3  page 381  
antoninus was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations   both roman and foreign he is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the  which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice a  formerly only a private ritual now being also performed for the sake of the emperors welfaregary forsythe time in roman religion one thousand years of religious history london routledge 2012 isbn 978 0 415 52217 5  page 92  antoninus also offered patronage to the worship of  to whom he erected a temple in  samuel dill roman society from nero to marcus aurelius library of alexandria sdg   in 148 he presided over the celebrations of the 900th anniversary of the founding of rome
antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the res publica no matter how extended and ill defined his competences were theore the fact that he is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasure the  into the fiscus itself or patrimonium the properties of the crown the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne   and the res privata the private properties tied to the personal maintenance of the emperor the res privata lands could be sold and or given away while the patrimonium properties were regarded as publicdavid s potter the roman empire at bay london routledge 2014 isbn 978 0 415 84054 5  page 49  it was a way of pretending that the imperial function   and most properties attached to it   was a public one formally subject to the authority of the senate and the roman peopleheinz bellen die verstaatlichung des privatvermögens der römische kaiser hildegard temporini ed aufstieg und niedergang der römischen welt berlin de gruyter 1974 isbn 3 11 004571 0 page 112   that the distinction played no part in subsequent political history   that the personal power of the princeps absorbed his role as office holder   proves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutionsaloys winterling politics and society in imperial rome malden ma john wiley amp sons 2009 isbn 978 1 4051 7969 0  pages 73 75 
of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information but to judge by what is extant those twenty two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign however antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire name bury pg 526bury pg 526  one of his chief concerns was to having local communities conforming their legal procedures to existing roman norms in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers irenarchs in asia minor antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogationsto be used in the possibility of an appeal to the roman governorclifford ando imperial rome ad 193 to 284 the critical century edinburgh university press 2012isbn 978 0 7486 2050 0page 91  also although antoninus was not an innovator he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality and introduced into  many important new principles based upon this notion name bury pg 526bury pg 526 
in this the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers l fulvius aburnius valens an author of legal treatises l volusius maecianus chosen to conduct the legal studies of marcus aurelius and author of a large work on fidei commissa testamentary trusts l ulpius marcellus a prolific writer and two others  name bury pg 526bury pg 526   his reign saw the appearance of the institutes of gaius an elementary legal manual for beginners see  name bury pg 526bury pg 526 
antoninus passed measures to facilitate the  of  name bury pg 527bury pg 527  mostly he favoured the principle of favor libertatis giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcutkeith bradley slavery and society at rome cambridge university press 1994 isbn 0 521 37287 9  page 162  also he punished the killing of a slave by his her master without previous trialaubert jean jacques l’esclave en droit romain ou l’impossible réification de l’homme esclavage et travail forcé cahiers de la recherche sur les droits fondamentaux crdf vol 10 2012  and determined that slaves could be forcibly sold to another master by a  in cases of consistent mistreatmentanastasia serghidou ed fear of slaves fear of enslavement in the ancient mediterranean presses univ franche comté 2007 isbn 978 2 84867 169 7  page 159    in criminal law antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are  name bury pg 527bury pg 527   he also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held and the punishment inflicted in the place where the crime had been committed he mitigated the use of  in examining slaves by certain limitations thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years though this rule had exceptions name bury pg 527bury pg 527  however it must be stressed that antoninus extended by means of a  the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases  48189 as quoted by edward peters torture philadelphia university of pennsylvania press 1996 isbn 0 8122 1599 0  page  29  also already at the time torture of free men of low status humiliores had become legal as proved by the fact that antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it and also free men of high rank honestiores in generalgrant 154 155

scholars place antoninus pius as the leading candidate for fulfilling the role as a friend of rabbi  according to the  avodah zarah 10a b rabbi judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in rome he had a close friendship with antoninus possibly antoninus piusa mischcon abodah zara p10a soncino 1988 mischcon cites various sources sj rappaport is of opinion that our antoninus is antoninus pius other opinions cited suggest antoninus was   or   who would consult rabbi judah on various worldly and spiritual matters
in 156 antoninus pius turned 70 he found it difficult to keep himself upright without  he started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions as antoninus aged marcus would take on more administrative duties more still when he became the  an office that was as much secretarial as military gavius maximus died in 156 or 157birley marcus aurelius 112  in 160 marcus and lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year perhaps antoninus was already ill in any case he died before the year was outbirley marcus aurelius 114

antoninus pius remains were laid to rest in  a  was dedicated to him on the  name weigel antoninus pius  and the  he had built in the forum in 141 to his deified wife faustina was rededicated to the deified faustina and the deified antoninus name bury pg 532bury pg 532  it survives as the church of san lorenzo in miranda name birley marcus aurelius 118birley marcus aurelius 118 
the only account of his life handed down to us is that of the  an unreliable and mostly fabricated work nevertheless it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance it is the only source that mentions the erection of the antonine wall in britainhistoria augusta life of antoninus pius 54   antoninus is unique among roman emperors in that he has no other biographies historians have theore turned to public records for what details we know
antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient romans but also by later scholars of classical history such as  or the author of the article on antoninus pius in the ninth edition of the 
later historians had a more nuanced view of his reign according to the historian  
inevitably the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether one should interpret with older scholars that he wisely curtailed the activities of the roman empire to a caul minimum or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from rome and  and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only marcus aurelius but also the emperors of the third century  german historian  has had it in his römische geschichte 2 vols ed by h bengtson stuttgart 1954 that the reign of antoninus comprised a succession of grossly wasted opportunities given the upheavals that were to come there is more to this argument given that the parthians in the east were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after antoninus passing  kornemanns brief is that antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders
although only one of his four children survived to adulthood antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent roman statesmen and socialites including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the emperor   the family of antoninus pius and  also represents one of the few periods in ancient roman history where the position of emperor passed smoothly from father to son  direct descendants of antoninus and faustina were confirmed to exist at least into the fifth century ad

the advanced encryption standard aes also known as rijndael name rijndael  name rijndael ammendedpdf   its original name is a specification for the  of electronic data established by the us  nist in 2001 name fips 197 
aes is based on the rijndael  name rijndael ammendedpdf  developed by two  cryptographers  and  who submitted a proposal to nist during the aes selection process  rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes
for aes nist selected three members of the rijndael family each with a block size of 128 bits but three different key lengths 128 192 and 256 bits
aes has been adopted by the  and is now used worldwide it supersedes the  des  which was published in 1977 the algorithm described by aes is a  meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data
in the  aes was announced by the nist as us  pub 197 fips 197 on november 26 2001 name fips 197   this announcement followed a five year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before the rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable see  for more details
aes became effective as a federal government standard on may 26 2002 after approval by the  aes is included in the iso iec 18033 3 standard aes is available in many different encryption packages and is the first publicly accessible and open  approved by the  nsa for  information when used in an nsa approved cryptographic module see  below
the name rijndael  is a play on the names of the two inventors joan daemen and vincent rijmen
the advanced encryption standard aes is defined in each of
 fips pub 197 advanced encryption standard aes name fips 197  
 iso iec 18033 3 information technology — security techniques — encryption algorithms — part 3 block ciphers  name iso_iec_aes  
aes is based on a design principle known as a  combination of both substitution and permutation and is fast in both software and hardware  unlike its predecessor des aes does not use a  aes is a variant of rijndael which has a fixed  of 128 s and a  of 128 192 or 256 bits by contrast the rijndael specification per se is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits both with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits
aes operates on a 4×4  matrix of bytes termed the state although some versions of rijndael have a larger block size and have additional columns in the state most aes calculations are done in a special 
for instance if there are 16 bytes ttbsub0 subbsub1 subbsub15 sub tt these bytes are represented as this matrix
math
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 amp b_4 amp b_8 amp b_{12} \\
b_1 amp b_5 amp b_9 amp b_{13} \\
b_2 amp b_6 amp b_{10} amp b_{14} \\
b_3 amp b_7 amp b_{11} amp b_{15}
\end{bmatrix}
 math
the key size used for an aes cipher specifies the number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the input called the plaintext into the final output called the ciphertext the number of cycles of repetition are as follows
 10 cycles of repetition for 128 bit keys
 12 cycles of repetition for 192 bit keys
 14 cycles of repetition for 256 bit keys
each round consists of several processing steps each containing four similar but different stages including one that depends on the encryption key itself a set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key
# keyexpansions—round keys are derived from the cipher key using  aes requires a separate 128 bit round key block for each round plus one more
# initialround
## ttaddroundkey tt—each byte of the state is combined with a block of the round key using bitwise xor
# rounds
## ttsubbytes tt—a non linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a 
## ttshiftrows tt—a transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically a certain number of steps
## ttmixcolumns tt—a mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state combining the four bytes in each column
## ttaddroundkey tt
# final round no ttmixcolumns tt
## ttsubbytes tt
## ttshiftrows tt
## ttaddroundkey tt
in the ttsubbytes tt step each byte matha_{ij} math in the state matrix is replaced with a ttsubbyte tt mathsa_{ij} math using an 8 bit  the  this operation provides the non linearity in the  the s box used is derived from the  over 2sup8 sup known to have good non linearity properties to avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties the s box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible  the s box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points and so is a  ie math sa_{ij} \neq a_{ij}  math and also any opposite fixed points ie math sa_{ij} \oplus a_{ij} \neq \text{0xff}  math
while performing the decryption inverse subbytes step is used which requires first taking the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse just reversing the steps used in subbytes step
the ttshiftrows tt step operates on the rows of the state it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain  for aes the first row is left unchanged each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left similarly the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively for blocks of sizes 128 bits and 192 bits the shifting pattern is the same row n is shifted left circular by n 1 bytes in this way each column of the output state of the ttshiftrows tt step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets for a 256 bit block the first row is unchanged and the shifting for the second third and fourth row is 1 byte 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively—this change only applies for the rijndael cipher when used with a 256 bit block as aes does not use 256 bit blocks the importance of this step is to avoid the columns being linearly independent in which case aes degenerates into four independent block ciphers
in the ttmixcolumns tt step the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible  the ttmixcolumns tt function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes where each input byte affects all four output bytes together with ttshiftrows tt ttmixcolumns tt provides  in the cipher
during this operation each column is transformed using a fixed matrix matrix multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state
math
\begin{bmatrix}
2 amp 3 amp 1 amp 1 \\
1 amp 2 amp 3 amp 1 \\
1 amp 1 amp 2 amp 3 \\
3 amp 1 amp 1 amp 2
\end{bmatrix}
 math
matrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries entries are 8 bit bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order xsup7 sup addition is simply xor multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial xsup8 sup+xsup4 sup+xsup3 sup+x+1 if processed bit by bit then after shifting a conditional  with 0x1b should be performed if the shifted value is larger than 0xff overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial these are special cases of the usual multiplication in gf2sup8 sup
in more general sense each column is treated as a polynomial over gf2sup8 sup and is then multiplied modulo xsup4 sup+1 with a fixed polynomial cx   0x03 · xsup3 sup + xsup2 sup + x + 0x02 the coefficients are displayed in their  equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from gf2x the ttmixcolumns tt step can also be viewed as a multiplication by the shown particular  in the  gf2sup8 sup this process is described further in the article 
in the ttaddroundkey tt step the subkey is combined with the state for each round a subkey is derived from the main  using  each subkey is the same size as the state the subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise 
on systems with 32 bit or larger words it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining the ttsubbytes tt and ttshiftrows tt steps with the ttmixcolumns tt step by transforming them into a sequence of table lookups this requires four 256 entry 32 bit tables and utilizes a total of four kilobytes 4096 bytes of memory — one kilobyte for each table a round can then be done with 16 table lookups and 12 32 bit exclusive or operations followed by four 32 bit exclusive or operations in the ttaddroundkey tt stephttp  wwwspringerlinkcom index uvx5nqgnn55vk199pdf efficient software implementation of aes on 32 bit platforms lecture notes in computer science 2523 2003 
if the resulting four kilobyte table size is too large for a given target platform the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256 entry 32 bit ie 1 kilobyte table by the use of circular rotates
using a byte oriented approach it is possible to combine the ttsubbytes tt ttshiftrows tt and ttmixcolumns tt steps into a single round operation 
until may 2009 the only successful published attacks against the full aes were s on some specific implementations the  nsa reviewed all the aes finalists including rijndael and stated that all of them were secure enough for us government non classified data in june 2003 the us government announced that aes could be used to protect 
blockquotethe design and strength of all key lengths of the aes algorithm ie 128 192 and 256 are sufficient to protect classified information up to the secret level top secret information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths the implementation of aes in products intended to protect national security systems and or information must be reviewed and certified by nsa prior to their acquisition and use  blockquote
aes has 10 rounds for 128 bit keys 12 rounds for 192 bit keys and 14 rounds for 256 bit keys by 2006 the best known attacks were on 7 rounds for 128 bit keys 8 rounds for 192 bit keys and 9 rounds for 256 bit keys name improved     and  improved cryptanalysis of rijndael  2000 pp213–230 http  wwwschneiercom paper rijndaelhtml 
for cryptographers a  break is anything faster than a —performing one trial decryption for each key see  this includes results that are infeasible with current technology the largest successful publicly known  against any block cipher encryption was against a 64 bit  key by  in 2006 name zd20060430 
aes has a fairly simple algebraic description  in 2002 a theoretical attack termed the  was announced by  and  purporting to show a weakness in the aes algorithm due to its simple description   since then other papers have shown that the attack as originally presented is unworkable see 
during the aes process developers of competing algorithms wrote of rijndael we are concerned about its usein security critical applications name rijndael algebraic
  however in october 2000 at the end of the aes selection process  a developer of the competing algorithm  wrote that while he thought successful academic attacks on rijndael would be developed someday he does not believe that anyone will ever discover an attack that will allow someone to read rijndael trafficbruce schneier http  wwwschneiercom crypto gram 0010html aes announced october 15 2000 
on july 1 2009 bruce schneier blogged 
about a  on the 192 bit and 256 bit versions of aes discovered by  and dmitry khovratovich 
which exploits aess somewhat simple key schedule and has a complexity of 2sup119 sup in december 2009 it was improved to 2sup995 sup this is a follow up to an attack discovered earlier in 2009 by alex biryukov dmitry khovratovich and ivica nikolić with a complexity of 2sup96 sup for one out of every 2sup35 sup keys  however related key attacks are not of concern in any properly designed cryptographic protocol as properly designed software will not use related keys
another attack was blogged by bruce schneier 
on july 30 2009 and released as a preprint 
on august 3 2009 this new attack by alex biryukov orr dunkelman nathan keller dmitry khovratovich and  is against aes 256 that uses only two related keys and 2sup39 sup time to recover the complete 256 bit key of a 9 round version or 2sup45 sup time for a 10 round version with a stronger type of related subkey attack or 2sup70 sup time for an 11 round version 256 bit aes uses 14 rounds so these attacks arent effective against full aes
in november 2009 the first  against a reduced 8 round version of aes 128 was released as a preprint 
this known key distinguishing attack is an improvement of the rebound or the start from the middle attacks for aes like permutations which view two consecutive rounds of permutation as the application of a so called super sbox it works on the 8 round version of aes 128 with a time complexity of 2sup48 sup and a memory complexity of 2sup32 sup  128 bit aes uses 10 rounds so this  attack isnt effective against full aes 128
in july 2010 vincent rijmen published an ironic paper on chosen key relations in the middle attacks on aes 128 
the first s on full aes were due to andrey bogdanov dmitry khovratovich and christian rechberger and were published in 2011  the attack is a  and is faster than brute force by a factor of about four it requires 2sup1262 sup operations to recover an aes 128 key for aes 192 and aes 256 2sup1902 sup and 2sup2546 sup operations are needed respectively this result has been further improved to 2sup1260 sup for aes 128 2sup1899 sup for aes 192 and 2sup2543 sup for aes 256 name 0  which are the current best results in key recovery attack against aes
this is a very small gain as a 126 bit key instead of 128 bits would still take billions of years to brute force on current and foreseeable hardware also the authors calculate the best attack using their technique on aes with a 128 bit key requires storing 2sup88 sup bits of data which later has been improved to 2sup56 sup  name 0   that works out to about 38 trillion terabytes of data which is more than all the data stored on all the computers on the planet as such this is a theoretical attack that has no practical implication on aes security 
according to the  the nsa is doing research on whether a cryptographic attack based on  may help to break aes 
as for now there are no known practical attacks that would allow anyone to read correctly implemented aes encrypted data
   possibly out of date   
 do not attack the underlying cipher and thus are not related to security in that context they rather attack implementations of the cipher on systems which inadvertently leak data there are several such known attacks on certain implementations of aes
in april 2005  announced a cache timing attack that he used to break a custom server that used s aes encryption name bernstein_timing  the attack required over 200 million chosen plaintexts  the custom server was designed to give out as much timing information as possible the server reports back the number of machine cycles taken by the encryption operation however as bernstein pointed out reducing the precision of the servers timestamps or eliminating them from the servers responses does not stop the attack the client simply uses round trip timings based on its local clock and compensates for the increased noise by averaging over a larger number of samples name bernstein_timing  
in october 2005 dag arne osvik  and eran tromer presented a paper demonstrating several cache timing attacks against aes  one attack was able to obtain an entire aes key after only 800 operations triggering encryptions in a total of 65 milliseconds this attack requires the attacker to be able to run programs on the same system or platform that is performing aes
in december 2009 an attack on some hardware implementations was published that used  and allows recovery of a key with a complexity of 2sup32 sup 
in november 2010 endre bangerter david gullasch and stephan krenn published a paper which described a practical approach to a near real time recovery of secret keys from aes 128 without the need for either cipher text or plaintext the approach also works on aes 128 implementations that use compression tables such as openssl   like some earlier attacks this one requires the ability to run unprivileged code on the system performing the aes encryption which may be achieved by malware infection far more easily than commandeering the root account 
the  cmvp is operated jointly by the united states governments  nist computer security division and the  cse of the government of canada the use of cryptographic modules validated to nist  is required by the united states government for encryption of all data that has a classification of sensitive but unclassified sbu or above from nstissp #11 national policy governing the acquisition of information assurance encryption products for protecting classified information will be certified by nsa and encryption products intended for protecting sensitive information will be certified in accordance with nist fips 140 2 name cnssgovhttp  wwwcnssgov assets pdf nstissp_11_fspdf 
the government of canada also recommends the use of  validated cryptographic modules in unclassified applications of its departments
although nist publication 197 fips 197 is the unique document that covers the aes algorithm vendors typically approach the cmvp under fips 140 and ask to have several algorithms such as  or  validated at the same time theore it is rare to find cryptographic modules that are uniquely fips 197 validated and nist itself does not generally take the time to list fips 197 validated modules separately on its public web site instead fips 197 validation is typically just listed as an fips approved aes notation with a specific fips 197 certificate number in the current list of fips 140 validated cryptographic modules
the cryptographic algorithm validation program cavp  allows for independent validation of the correct implementation of the aes algorithm at a reasonable cost successful validation results in being listed on the http  csrcnistgov groups stm cmvp documents 140 1 140val allhtm nist validations page this testing is a pre requisite for the fips 140 2 module validation described below however successful cavp validation in no way implies that the cryptographic module implementing the algorithm is secure a cryptographic module lacking fips 140 2 validation or specific approval by the nsa is not deemed secure by the us government and cannot be used to protect government data name cnssgov 
fips 140 2 validation is challenging to achieve both technically and fiscally name openssl  there is a standardized battery of tests as well as an element of source code review that must be passed over a period of a few weeks the cost to perform these tests through an approved laboratory can be significant eg well over 30000 us name openssl   and does not include the time it takes to write test document and prepare a module for validation after validation modules must be re submitted and re evaluated if they are changed in any way this can vary from simple paperwork updates if the security functionality did not change to a more substantial set of re testing if the security functionality was impacted by the change
test vectors are a set of known ciphers for a given input and key  distributes the erence of aes test vectors as http  csrcnistgov groups stm cavp documents aes kat_aeszip aes known answer test kat vectors in zip format
high speed and low ram requirements were criteria of the aes selection process thus aes performs well on a wide variety of hardware from 8 bit s to high performance computers
on a  aes encryption requires 18 clock cycles per byte  equivalent to a throughput of about 11ampnbspmb s for a 200ampnbspmhz processor on a 17ampnbspghz  throughput is about 60ampnbspmb s

an argot  from  argot  ‘’ is a  used by various groups—eg schoolmates outlaws colleagues among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations the term argot is also used to er to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study occupation or hobby in which  it overlaps with 
the author  was one of the first to research argot extensively  he describes it in his 1862 novel  as the language of the dark at one point he says what is argot properly speaking argot is the language of misery
the earliest known record of the term argot in this context was in a 1628 document the word was probably derived from the contemporary name les argotiers given to a group of thieves at that timeguiraud pierre largot que sais je paris puf 1958 p 700 
under the strictest definition an argot is a proper language with its own grammar and style but such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common on which the argot is largely based such argots are mainly versions of another language with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public argot used in this  is ous with  for example argot in this sense is used for systems such as  and  which retain french syntax and apply transformations only to individual words and often only to a certain subset of words such as nouns or semantic content words name valdman  such systems are examples of argots à clef or coded argots name valdman 
specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way for example modern   ‘crazy goofy’ now common usage originates in the  transformation of fr  ‘crazy’
piaf is a parisian argot word for “bird ” it was taken up by the singer  as her stage name

anisotropy  is the property of being directionally dependent as opposed to  which implies identical properties in all directions it can be defined as a difference when measured along different axes in a materials physical or mechanical properties     etc an example of anisotropy is the light coming through a  another is  which is easier to split along its  than against it
in the field of  an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its geometric  as is the case with 
 af is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view older techniques such as  and  do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from which can result in  or blurring of textures by reducing detail in one direction more than another these effects can be reduced
a chemical anisotropic  as used to filter particles is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the  s filter out larger particles and  regions increasingly remove smaller particles resulting in greater flow through and more efficient filtration
in  the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their   in this context anisotropic systems er to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density like the pi system of  this abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change
in  the  calculated from the  properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane polarized light is used eg to determine the shape of a macromolecule
anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon
images of a gravity bound or man made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity vertical and horizontal
   this section is linked from    
 from  reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in  in 1977 their experiment demonstrated the  caused by the movement of the earth with respect to the  the source of the radiation  cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars
physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction dependent properties of materials  for example may occur in a  so that its magnetic field is oriented in a perred direction plasmas may also show filamentation such as that seen in  or a  that is directional
an anisotropic liquid has the fluidity of a normal liquid but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis unlike water or  which contain no structural ordering of the molecules  are examples of anisotropic liquids
some materials  in a way that is isotropic that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source  heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required the materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in  are often anisotropic
many s are anisotropic to  optical anisotropy and exhibit properties such as   describes light propagation in these media an axis of anisotropy is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken or an axis of symmetry such as normal to crystalline layers some materials can have multiple such 
 is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material where features smaller than the seismic  eg crystals cracks pores layers or inclusions have a dominant alignment this alignment leads to a directional variation of  wavespeed measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the earth indeed significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the earths   and 
 formations with distinct layers of  material can exhibit electrical anisotropy  in one direction eg parallel to a layer is different from that in another eg perpendicular to a layer this property is used in the gas and  industry to identify  bearing sands in sequences of  and  sand bearing hydrocarbon assets have high  low conductivity whereas shales have lower resistivity  instruments measure this conductivity resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells
the  of s is often anisotropic for the same reason when calculating groundwater flow to rjoosterbaan 1997 the energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance on line http  wwwwaterloginfo pdf enerartpdf the corresponding free endrain program can be downloaded from http  wwwwaterloginfo endrainhtm  or to rjoosterbaan 2002 subsurface drainage by tubewells 9 pp on line http  wwwwaterloginfo pdf wellspacpdf the corresponding free welldrain program can be downloaded from http  wwwwaterloginfo weldrainhtm  the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account otherwise the results may be subject to error
most common rock forming s are anisotropic including  and  anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their  an example of an isotropic mineral is 
anisotropy is also a well known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting  of soft tissues such as tendons when the angle of the transducer is changed tendon fibers appear hyperechoic bright when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon but can appear hypoechoic darker when the transducer is angled obliquely this can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners
anisotropy in material science is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior an example would be the dependence of  on the direction of load 
anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain  patterns often produced during manufacturing of the material  in the case of rolling stringers of texture are produced in the direction of rolling which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions
some materials such as wood and fibre reinforced  are very anisotropic being much stronger along the grain fibre than across it metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour this is especially important in processes such as  
wood is a naturally anisotropic  material  its properties vary widely when measured with or against the growth grain  for example woods strength and hardness is different for the same sample measured in different orientations
anisotropic etching techniques such as  are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high   these features are commonly used in  and  devices where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical electrical or physical properties to the device anisotropic etching can also er to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material perentially over certain crystallographic planes eg koh etching of  100 produces pyramid like structures
 is an  technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion  of water molecules in the brain  water molecules located in  are more likely to be anisotropic since they are restricted in their movement they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and theore display more isotropy  this difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual
 fields see  from a lective surface are often not isotropic in nature this makes calculations of the total energy being lected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate in  applications anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes immensely simplifying the calculation of the net lectance or thereby the net  of a scene
for example let the  be math\gamma\omega_i \omega_v math where i denotes incident direction and v denotes viewing direction as if from a satellite or other instrument and let p be the planar albedo which represents the total lectance from the scene
mathp\omega_i   \int_{\omega_v}\gamma\omega_i \omega_v\hat{n}\cdot d\hat{\omega_v} math
matha\omega_i \omega_v   \frac{\gamma\omega_i \omega_v}{p\omega_i} math
it is of interest because with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined a measurement of the  from a single viewing direction say math\omega_v math yields a measure of the total scene lectance planar albedo for that specific incident geometry saymath\omega_i math

alpha decay or α decay is a type of  in which an  emits an  helium nucleus and thereby transforms or decays into an atom with a  that is reduced by four and an  that is reduced by two an  is identical to the nucleus of a  atom which consists of two s and two s for example  decays to form  name suchockisuchocki john conceptual chemistry 2007 page 119

both mass number and atomic number are conserved the mass number is 238 on the left side and 234 + 4 on the right side and the atomic number is 92 on the left side and 90 + 2 on the right side alpha particles have a  +2 but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms the charge is not usually shown
alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides theoretically it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than  element 28 where the overall  per  is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are theore unstable toward spontaneous fission type processes in practice this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel with the lightest known alpha emitter being the lightest s mass numbers 106–110 of  element 52
alpha decay is by far the most common form of  where the parent  ejects a defined  collection of s leaving another defined product behind it is the most common form because of the combined extremely high  and relatively small mass of the alpha particle like other cluster decays alpha decay is fundamentally a  process unlike  it is governed by the interplay between both the  and the

alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by  in 1899 and by 1907 they were identified as hesup2+ sup ions
by 1928  had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling the alpha particle is trapped in a  by the nucleus classically it is forbidden to escape but according to the then newly discovered principles of  it has a tiny but non zero probability of  through the  and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles a relationship between the  of the decay and the energy of the emission which had been previously discovered empirically and was known as the http  wwwphyuctacza courses phy300w np ch1 node38html for gamows derivation of this law see

alpha decay can provide a safe power source for s used for s  and were used for   alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay  for example requires only 25 millimetres of  shielding to protect against unwanted radiation
s typically use  an alpha emitter to ionize air allowing the static cling to more rapidly dissipate
being relatively heavy and positively charged alpha particles tend to have a very short  and quickly lose kinetic energy within a short distance of their source this results in several  being deposited in a relatively small volume of material this increases the chance of cellular damage in cases of internal contamination in general external alpha radiation is not harmful since alpha particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air a piece of paper or the thin layer of dead skin cells that make up the  even touching an alpha source is typically not harmful though many alpha sources are also accompanied by  radio daughters and alpha emission is also accompanied by gamma photon emission if substances emitting alpha particles are ingested inhaled injected or introduced through the skin then it could result in a measurable 
the  rbe of alpha radiation is higher than that of beta or gamma radiation rbe quantifies the ability of radiation to cause certain biological effects notably either  or  for equivalent radiation exposure the higher value for alpha radiation is generally attributable to the high  let coefficient which is about one ionization of a chemical bond for every  of travel by the alpha particle the rbe has been set at the value of 20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations the rbe is set at 10 for  irradiation and at 1 for  and ionizing photons
however another component of alpha radiation is the  of the parent nucleus termed alpha recoil this recoil which is due to the  acts much like the kick of a rifle butt when a bullet goes in the opposite direction this gives a significant amount of energy to the recoiling nucleus which also causes ionization damage see  the total energy of the recoiled nucleus is readily calculable and is roughly the weight of the alpha 4ampnbsp divided by the weight of the parent typically about 200ampnbspu times the total energy of the alpha by some estimates this might account for most of the internal radiation damage as the recoil nuclei are typically  which perentially collect on the s in some studies
  this has resulted in an rbe approaching 1000 instead of the value used in governmental regulations

extreme poverty absolute poverty or destitution was originally defined by the  in 1995 as a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs including food safe drinking water sanitation facilities health shelter education and information it depends not only on income but also on access to servicesunited nations http  wwwunorg documents ga conf166 aconf166 9htm report of the world summit for social development march 6–12 1995  currently extreme poverty widely ers to earning below the international poverty line of 125 day in 2005 prices set by the  this measure is the equivalent to earning 100 a day in 1996 us prices hence the widely used expression living on less than a dollar a daymartin ravallion shaohua chen amp prem sangraula may 2008 pdf dollar a day revisited report washington dc the world bank retrieved 10 june 2013  the vast majority of those in extreme poverty – 96% – reside in     nearly half live in  and  alone name usaid1http  wwwusaidgov sites default files documents 1870 usaid extreme poverty discussion paperpdf getting to zero usaid discussion paper november 21st 2013 
the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger was the first  mdg1 as set by 189 united nations member states in 2000 specifically mdg1 set a target of reducing the extreme poverty rate in half by 2015 a goal that was met 5 years ahead of schedule with the expiration of the mdgs fast approaching the international community including the un the  and the us has set a target of ending extreme poverty by 2030
extreme poverty is defined by the international community as earning less than a 125 a day as measured in 2005 international prices originally the international poverty line was set at earning a 1 a day when the millennium development goals were first published however in 2008 the world bank pushed the line to 125 to recognize higher price levels in several developing countries than previously estimated
as of september 2010 the most recent reliable date according to the un roughly 12 billion people remain in extreme poverty based on this metricun mdg factsheethttp  wwwunorg en mdg summit2010 pdf mdg_fs_1_enpdf we can end poverty 2015 september 20–22 2010  despite the significant number of individuals still earning below the international poverty line this figure represents significant progress for the international community as this number is 700 million fewer than the number living in extreme poverty in 1990 – 19 billionusaid http  wwwusaidgov endextremepoverty end extreme poverty last updated july 2nd 2014  as highlighted in the next section though there are many criticisms of a purely income based approach to measuring extreme poverty the 125 day line remains the most widely used metric as it is easily accessible to the public at large and draws attention to those in the direst need name usaid1 
on september 23 2015 the  based  reported that the world bank intends to revise its income based benchmark upward to 190 a dayft http  wwwftcom intl cms s 0 81b0ac66 61e5 11e5 9846 de406ccb37f2html planet’s poor set to swell as world bank moves poverty line last updated september 23 2015   as a result poverty numbers are likely to swell according to the paper
though widely used by most international organizations the 125 day extreme poverty line has come under scrutiny from a variety of actors for example when used to measure headcount ratio ie the percentage of people living below the line the 125 day line is unable to capture other important measures such as depth of poverty relative poverty and how people view their own financial situation known as the socially subjective poverty line  moreover the calculation of the poverty line relies on several debatable assumptions about purchasing power parity homogeneity of household size and makeup and consumer prices used to determine a basket of essential goods not to mention the fact that there may be missing data from the poorest and most fragile countries which may muddle the picture even further
to address these problems several alternative instruments for measuring extreme poverty have been suggested which incorporate other factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to a basic education thus the 2010 human development report introduced the multidimensional poverty index mpi which measures not only income but also basic needs using this tool the united nations development programme undp estimated that roughly 15 billion people remained in extreme poverty as opposed to the conventional figure of 12 billionunited nations development programmehttp  hdrundporg en content multidimensional poverty index mpi multidimensional poverty index mpi retrieved on 17 january 2014  as this figure is considered more holistic it may shed new light on relative deprivation within a country for example in ethiopia 39% of the population is considered extremely poor under conventional measures but 90% are in multidimensional povertydan morrellhttp  harvardmagazinecom 2011 01 who is poor who is poor  january–february 2011 
another version of the mpi known as the alkire foster method created by sabina alkire and james foster of the  ophi can be broken down to lect both the incidence and the intensity of poverty this tool is useful as development officials using the m0 measure of the method which is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived can determine the most likely causes of poverty within a regionophihttp  wwwophiorguk research multidimensional poverty alkire foster method  alkire foster method 2014  for example in the  of bhutan using the m0 measure of the alkire foster method reveals that poverty in the region is primarily caused by a lack of access to electricity and drinking water in addition to widespread overcrowding in contrast data from the  of bhutan reveals that income is a much larger contributor to poverty as opposed to other dimensions within the regionsabina alkire and james fosterhttp  wwwifpriorg sites default files publications oc63ch03pdf counting and multidimensional poverty  
using the world bank definition of 125 day as of september 2013 roughly 12 billion people remain in extreme poverty nearly half live in india and china with more than 85% living in just 20 countries since the mid 1990s there has been a steady decline in both the worldwide poverty rate and the total number of extreme poor in 1990 the percentage of the global population living in extreme poverty was 431% but in 2010 that percentage had dropped down to 206% name usaid1  this halving of the extreme poverty rate falls in line with the first millennium development goal mdg1 proposed by former un secretary general kofi annan who called on the international community at the turn of the century to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty…by 2015 name annan_2000 
this reduction in extreme poverty took place most notably in china indonesia india pakistan and vietnam these five countries accounted for the alleviation of 715 million people out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2010 – more than the global net total of roughly 700 million this statistical oddity can be explained by the fact that the number of people living in extreme poverty in sub saharan africa rose from 290 million to 414 million over the same period name autogenerated1united nationshttp  wwwunorg millenniumgoals pdf report 2013 mdg report 2013 englishpdf the millennium development goals report 2013  however there have been many positive signs for extensive global poverty reduction as well since 1999 the total number of extreme poor has declined by 50 million per year on average moreover in 2005 for the first time in recorded history poverty rates began to fall in every region of the world including africarajiv shahhttp  wwwusaidgov news information speeches nov 21 2013 administrator rajiv shah brookings institution ending extreme poverty remarks by administrator rajiv shah at the brookings institution ending extreme poverty usaid november 21 2013  although this is largely due to a change in the 2000 un millennium declaration extending the plan period backward to 1990 it was previously 1996 changing the date took advantage of rapid population growth and a huge poverty reduction in china during the 1990s name ohchr 
as aforementioned the number of people living in extreme poverty has reduced from 19 billion to 12 billion over the span of the last 20–25 years if we remain on our current trajectory many economists predict we could reach global zero by 2030 2035 thus ending extreme poverty global zero entails a world in which fewer than 3% of the global population lives in extreme poverty projected under most optimistic scenarios to be fewer than 200 million people this zero figure is set at 3% in recognition of the fact that some amount of frictional poverty will continue to exist whether it is caused by political conflict or unexpected economic fluctuations at least for the foreseeable future name worldbank1world bankhttp  siteresourcesworldbankorg intprospects resources 334934 1327948020811 8401693 1397074077765 prosperity_for_all_final_2014pdf prosperity for all ending extreme poverty spring 2014  however the  notes that any projection about poverty more than a few years into the future runs the risk of being highly uncertain this is because changes in consumption and distribution throughout the developing world over the next two decades could result in monumental shifts in global poverty for better or worselaurence chandy et alhttp  wwwbrookingsedu ~ media research files reports 2013 04 ending%20extreme%20poverty%20chandy the_final_countdownpdf the final countdown prospects for ending extreme poverty brookings institution april 2013 
others are more pessimistic about this possibility with many predicting a range of 193 million to 660 million people living in extreme poverty by 2035 additionally some believe the rate of poverty reduction will slow down in the developing world especially in africa and as such it will take closer to five decades to reach global zeroalex thierhttp  blogusaidgov 2013 11 global effort to end extreme poverty  a global effort to end extreme poverty usaid november 22 2013  despite these reservations several prominent international and national organizations including the un the world bank and the united states federal government via usaid have set a target of reaching global zero by the end of 2030
there are a variety of factors that may reinforce or instigate the existence of extreme poverty such as weak institutions cycles of violence and a low level of growth recent world bank research shows that some countries can get caught in a fragility trap in which the above factors prevent the poorest nations from emerging from low level equilibrium in the long run name worldbank2world bankhttp  wwwworldbankorg content dam worldbank feature%20story stop_conflict_reduce_fragility_end_povertypdf stop conflict reduce fragility and end poverty doing things differently in fragile and conflict affected situations 2013  moreover most of the reduction in extreme poverty over the past twenty years has taken place in countries that have not experienced a civil conflict or have had governing institutions with a strong capacity to actually govern thus to end extreme poverty it is also important to focus on the interrelated problems of fragility and conflict
usaid defines fragility as a governments lack of both legitimacy the perception the government is adequate at doing its job and effectiveness how good the government is at maintaining law and order in an equitable manner as fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality additionally in countries with high levels of inequality a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations not to mention after removing china and india from the equation up to 70% of the worlds poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility looking further some analysts project extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in fragile low income states like haiti yemen and the central african republic over the coming yearsnancy lindborghttp  blogusaidgov 2014 02 to end extreme poverty tackle fragility  to end extreme poverty tackle fragility usaid february 13 2014  however some academics such as andy sumner assert that extreme poverty will be increasingly found concentrated in middle income countries creating apoverty paradox    as the worlds poor dont actually live in the poorest countriesandy summerhttp  wwwcgdevorg sites default files 1426481_file_sumner_where_in_the_world_final_0pdf where will the worlds poor live an update on global poverty and the new bottom billion center for global development september 2012 
despite this debate addressing the problem of fragility remains a very real issue to help low income fragile states make the transition towards peace and prosperity the new deal for engagement in fragile states endorsed by roughly forty countries and multilateral institutions was created in 2011 this new deal represents an important step towards redressing the problem of fragility as it was originally articulated by self identified fragile states who called on the international community to not only do things differently but to also do different things name pnaec864usaidhttp  pdfusaidgov pdf_docs pnaec864pdf ending extreme poverty in fragile contexts january 28 2014 
on the other hand civil conflict also remains a prime cause for the perpetuation of poverty throughout the developing world armed conflict can have severe effects on economic growth for a plethora of reasons – it destroys assets creates unwanted mass migration destroys livelihoods and diverts public resources towards war fighting name pnaec864  significantly a country that experienced major violence during 1981 2005 had extreme poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than a country with no violence on average a civil conflict will also cost a country roughly 30 years of gdp growth name worldbank2  theore a renewed commitment from the international community to address the deteriorating situation in highly fragile states is necessary to both prevent the mass loss of life but to also prevent the vicious cycle of extreme poverty
on september 6 8th 2000 world leaders gathered at the  held in new york launching the  suggested by then un secretary general  prior to the launch of the conference the office of secretary general annan released a report entitled we the peoples the role of the united nations in the 21st century in this document now widely known as the millennium report kofi annan called on the international community to adopt the target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and so lifting more than 1 billion people out of it by 2015 citing studies that show an almost perfect correlation between growth and poverty reduction in poor countries annan urged international leaders to indiscriminately target the problem of extreme poverty across every region name annan_2000  in charge of managing the project was jeffrey sachs a noted development economist who in 2005 released a plan for action called investing in development a practical plan to achieve the millennium development goalsjeffrey sachs http  wwwunmillenniumprojectorg documents mainreportcomplete lowrespdf investing in development a practical plan to achieve the millennium development goals united nations 2005 
the  held on september 14 16th was organized to measure international progress towards fulfilling the  mdgs notably the conference brought together more than 170 heads of state while world leaders at the summit were encouraged by the reduction of poverty in some nations they were concerned by the uneven decline of poverty within and among different regions of the globe however at the end of the summit the conference attendees reaffirmed the uns commitment to achieve the mdgs by 2015 and urged all supranational national and non governmental organizations to follow suit
with the expiration of the millennium development goals approaching in 2015 the international community is focused on accelerating efforts to achieve the goals laid out in the original mdgs overall there has been significant progress towards reducing extreme poverty with the mdg 1 target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline…700 million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty in 2010 than in 1990 however at the global level 12 billion people were still living in extreme povertyunited nations http  wwwunorg millenniumgoals povertyshtml goal 1 eradicate extreme poverty amp hunger 2014  one notable exception to this trend was in sub saharan africa the only region where the number of people living in extreme poverty rose from 290 million in 1990 to 414 million in 2010 comprising more than a third of those living in extreme poverty worldwide name autogenerated1 
with the aforementioned in mind the un convened a high level panel hlp of eminent persons to advise on a  the hlp report entitled a new global partnership eradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable development was published in may 2013 in the report the hlp wrote that
blockquote ending extreme poverty is just the beginning not the end it is vital but our vision must be broader to start countries on the path of sustainable development – building on the foundations established by the 2012 un conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro12 and meeting a challenge that no country developed or developing has met so far we recommend to the secretary general that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty once and for all in the context of sustainable development blockquote
thus the report determined that a central goal of the post millennium development agenda is to eradicate extreme poverty…by 2030 however the report also emphasized that the mdgs were not enough as they did not focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on development…the importance to development of good governance and institution…nor the need for inclusive growth consequently there now exists synergy between the policy position papers put forward by the united states through usaid the world bank and the un itself in terms of viewing fragility and a lack of good governance as exacerbating extreme poverty however in a departure from the views of other organizations the commission also proposed that the un focus not only on extreme poverty a line drawn at 125 but also on a higher target such as 2 the report notes this change could be made to lect the fact that escaping extreme poverty is only a starthigh level panel of eminent persons http  wwwpost2015hlporg wp content uploads 2013 05 un reportpdf a new global partnership eradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable development united nations 2013 
in addition to the un a host of other supranational and national actors such as the european union and the african union have published their own positions or recommendations on what should be incorporated in the post 2015 agenda the european commissions communication published in a decent life for all from vision to collective action affirmed the uns commitment to eradicate extreme poverty in our lifetime and put the world on a sustainable path to ensure a decent life for all by 2030 a unique vision of the report was the commissions environmental focus in addition to a plethora of other goals such as combating hunger and gender inequality specifically the commission argued long term poverty reduction…requires inclusive and sustainable growth growth should create decent jobs take place with resource efficiency and within planetary boundaries and should support efforts to mitigate climate change  the african unions report entitled common african position cap on the post 2015 development agenda likewise encouraged the international community to focus on eradicating the twin problems of poverty and exclusion in our lifetime moreover the cap pledged that it would commit to ensure that no person – regardless of ethnicity gender geography disability race or other status – is denied universal human rights and basic economic opportunitiesafrican union http  wwwnepadorg sites default files common%20african%20position %20eng%20finalpdf common african position cap on the post 2015 development agenda 2014 
the un  ldc conferences were a series of summits organized by the un over the past few decades which sought to promote the substantial and even development of so called third world countries
1st un ldc conference
held between september 1 and september 14 1981 in paris the first un ldc conference was organized to finalize the uns substantial new programme of action for the 1980s in least developed countries this program which was unanimously adopted by the conference attendees argued for internal orms in ldcs meant to encourage economic growth to be complemented by strong international measures however despite the major economic and policy orms initiated many of these ldcs in addition to strong international aid the economic situation of these countries worsened as a whole in the 1980s this prompted the organization of a 2nd un ldc conference almost a decade later
2nd un ldc conference
held between september 3 and september 14 1990 once again in paris the second un ldc conference was convened to measure the progress made by the ldcs towards fulfilling their development goals during the 1980s recognizing the problems that plagued the ldcs over the past decade the conference formulated a new set of national and international policies to accelerate the growth rates of the poorest nations these new principles were embodied in the paris declaration and programme of action for the least developed countries for the 1990sunited nations http  wwwcinuorgmx temas desarrollo dessocial ldc ldc2_enpdf paris declaration and programme of action for the least developed countries for the 1900s 1992 
4th un ldc conference
the most recent conference held in may 2011 in istanbul recognized that the nature of development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier in the 21st century the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances as opposed to bilateral and multilateral assistance moreover since the 80s significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage with the creation of the g 20 conference of the largest economic powers including many nations in the global south formerly undeveloped nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations furthermore the conference recognized that in the midst of a deep global recession coupled with multiple crises energy climate food etc the international community would have fewer resources to aid the ldcs thus the un considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders not least the ldcs themselves crucial to the formulation of the conference
 
in 2013 the board of governors of the  wbg set two overriding goals for the wbg to commit itself to in the future first to end extreme poverty by 2030 an objective that echoes the sentiments of the un and the obama administration additionally the wbg set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020 second to focus on growth among the bottom 40 percent of people as opposed to standard gdp growth this commitment ensures that the growth of the developing world lifts people out of poverty rather than exacerbating inequality name worldbank1 
as the world banks primary focus is on delivering economic growth to enable equitable prosperity its developments programs are primarily commercial based in nature as opposed to the un since the world bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus less poverty the wbg seeks to support employment training initiatives small business development programs and strong labor protection laws however since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable the world bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing fieldworld bank http  wwwworldbankorg en topic poverty overview#2 poverty overview 2014 
moreover the world bank engages in a variety of nutritional transfer payments and transport based initiatives children who experience under nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability thus they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults the wbg estimates that as much as 3% of gdp can be lost as a result of under nutrition among the poorest nations to combat undernutrition the wbg has partnered with unicef and the who to ensure all small children are fully feed the wbg also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining childrens healthcare or ensuring school attendance finally the wbg understands investment in public transportation and better roads is key to breaking rural isolation improving access to healthcare and providing better job opportunities for the worlds poorworld bank http  wwwworldbankorg en news feature 2013 02 05 povertyreductioninpractice poverty reduction in practice how and where we work february 19 2013

the analytical engine was a proposed mechanical  designed by english mathematician and computer pioneer   name computerhistoryorghttp  wwwcomputerhistoryorg babbage engines   it was first described in 1837 as the successor to babbages  a design for a mechanical computer the analytical engine incorporated an   in the form of  and  and integrated  making it the first  design for a general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as  name babbageonline   in other words the logical structure of the analytical engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era name computerhistoryorg 
babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding name meccano   name nineteenth century science  it was not until the 1940s that  were actually built more than a century after babbage had proposed the pioneering analytical engine in 1837 name computerhistoryorg 
babbages first attempt at a mechanical computing device the  was a special purpose machine designed to tabulate s and s by evaluating s to create approximating s construction of this machine was never completed babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer  and ultimately the british government withdrew its funding for the project  
during this project he realized that a much more general design the analytical engine was possible the input consisting of programs and data formulae and data was to be provided to the machine via s a method being used at the time to direct mechanical s such as the  for output the machine would have a printer a curve plotter and a bell the machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later it employed ordinary  fixed point arithmetic
there was to be a store that is a memory capable of holding 1000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each ca 167  an  the mill would be able to perform all four  plus comparisons and optionally s initially it was conceived as a  curved back upon itself in a generally circular layouthttp  csestanfordedu classes sophomore college projects 98 babbage ana mechhtm  with the long store exiting off to one side later drawings depict a regularized grid layout  like the  cpu in a modern computer the mill would rely upon its  to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called barrels to carry out some of the more complex instructions the users program might specify name meccano 
the programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day s loops and conditional branching were possible and so the language as conceived would have been  as later defined by  three different types of punch cards were used one for arithmetical operations one for numerical constants and one for load and store operations transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back there were three separate readers for the three types of cards babbage developed some two dozen programs for the analytical engine between 1837 and 1840 and one program later these programs treat polynomials iterative formulas  and 
in 1842 the italian mathematician  whom babbage had met while travelling in italy wrote a description of the engine in french in 1843 the description was translated into english and extensively annotated by  who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier in recognition of her additions to menabreas paper which included a way to calculate bernoulli numbers using the machine she has been described as the first 
late in his life babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871 name meccano  
in 1878 a committee of the  recommended against constructing the analytical engine   
in 1910 babbages son henry prevost babbage reported that a part of the mill and the printing apparatus had been constructed and had been used to calculate a faulty list of multiples of  this constituted only a small part of the whole engine it was not programmable and had no storage popular images of this section have sometimes been mislabelled implying that it was the entire mill or even the entire engine henry babbages analytical engine mill is on display at the science museum in london name mill  henry also proposed building a demonstration version of the full engine with a smaller storage capacity perhaps for a first machine ten columns would do with fifteen wheels in each name fourmilab  such a version could manipulate 20ampnbspnumbers of 25ampnbspdigits each and what it could be told to do with those numbers could still be impressive it is only a question of cards and time wrote henry babbage in 1888  and there is no reason why twenty thousand cards should not be used if necessary in an analytical engine for the purposes of the mathematician name fourmilab  
in 1991 the  built a complete and working specimen of babbages  a design that incorporated inements babbage discovered during the development of the analytical engine name babbageonline   this machine was built using materials and s that would have been available to babbage quelling the suggestion that babbages designs could not have been produced using the manufacturing technology of his time 
in october 2010  started a campaign to raise funds by public subscription to enable serious historical and academic study of babbages plans with a view to then build and test a fully working virtual design which will then in turn enable construction of the physical analytical engine    as of october 2013 no actual construction had been reported
babbage is not known to have written down an explicit set of instructions for the engine in the manner of a modern processor manual  instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided
 has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions which would make the engine turing complete
blockquotethe cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse and hence to loop blockquote
blockquotethe introduction for the first time in 1845 of user operations for a variety of service functions including most importantly an effective system for user control of looping in user programs
there is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified in the absence of other evidence i have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in babbage’s sample programs there would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user blockquote
in their emulator of the engine  say
blockquotethe engines card reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish it can in addition directed by the very cards it reads and advised by the whether the mills run up lever is activated either advance the card chain forward skipping the intervening cards or backward causing previously read cards to be processed once again blockquote
this emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on babbages original works  for example a factorial program would be written as
 n0 6
 n1 1
 n2 1
 ×
 l1
 l0
 s1
  
 l0
 l2
 s0
 l2
 l0
 cb11
where the cb is the conditional branch instruction or combination card used to make the control flow jump in this case backwards by 11 cards
babbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as  writing in his passages from the life of a philosopher as soon as an analytical engine exists it will necessarily guide the future course of the science whenever any result is sought by its aid the question will then arise—by what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time
swedish engineers  inspired by a description of the difference engine created a mechanical calculation device based on the design in 1853 table sized instead of room sized the device was capable of calculating tables but imperfectly name nineteenth century science  
from 1872 henry continued diligently with his fathers work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875   wrote about the engine in 1915 and even designed his own analytical engine it was drawn up in detail but never built ludgates engine would be much smaller than babbages of about 8 cubic feet 230 l and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20 decimal digit numbers in about six seconds
despite this ground work babbages work fell into historical obscurity and the analytical engine was unknown to builders of electro mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work resulting in the need to re invent many of the architectural innovations babbage had proposed  who built the quickly obsoleted electromechanical calculator the  between 1937 and 1945 praised babbages work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature but knew nothing of the analytical engines architecture during the construction of the mark i and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the analytical engine the greatest disappointment of my life the mark i showed no influence from the analytical engine and lacked the analytical engines most prescient architectural feature   and  similarly were not aware of the details of babbages analytical engine work prior to the completion of their design for the first electronic general purpose computer the http  speciallibumnedu cbi oh pdfphtmlid 245 http  inventionsmithsonianorg downloads fa_cohc_tr_mauc730223pdf 
if the analytical engine had been built it would have been   and  it would however have been very slow luigi federico menabrea reported in sketch of the analytical engine mr babbage believes he can by his engine form the product of two numbers each containing twenty figures in three minutes
by comparison the  could perform the same task in just six seconds a modern pc can do the same thing in well under a millionth of a second it should be noted however that the analytical machine was described by babbage more than one hundred years before any of the aforementioned computational devices and theore it is no surprise that it was much slower

 in the  novel  a secret society calling itself the babbage society secretly financed the building of babbage engines in the mid 19th century in the novel the society uses the babbage engines along with a statistical science called cliology to predict and manipulate future history in the process they predict the rise of the nazis and accidentally start the us civil war
 in the  novel  ubiquitous molecular nanotechnology is described to make use of rod logic similar to that imagined by babbages design for the analytical engine

the reign of augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the  the roman peace the roman world was largely free from large scale conflict for more than two centuries despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the empires frontiers and one  over the imperial succession augustus dramatically enlarged the empire annexing     and  expanding possessions in  expanding into  and completing the conquest of

the senates control over some of the roman provinces helped maintain a republican façade for the autocratic principate name ccaa 24 25   also octavians control of entire provinces followed republican era precedents for the objective of securing peace and creating stability in which such prominent romans as pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability name ccaa 24 25  
on 16 january 27ampnbspbc the senate gave octavian the new titles of  and  name eck 50eck 2003 50  augustus is from the latin word augere meaning to increase and can be translated as the illustrious one name eck 49eck 2003 49  it was a title of religious authority rather than political authority name eck 49   according to roman religious beliefs the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanity—and in fact nature—that went beyond any constitutional definition of his status after the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control the change in name served to demarcate his benign reign as augustus from his reign of terror as octavian 
his new title of augustus was also more favorable than romulus the previous one which he styled for himself in erence to the story of  founders of rome which symbolized a second founding of rome name eck 49   the title of romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship an image that octavian tried to avoid name eck 149eck 2003 149  princeps comes from the latin phrase primum caput the first head originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial  in the case of augustus however it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in chargeeck 2003 3 149  princeps had also been a title under the republic for those who had served the state well for example pompey had held the title 
augustus also styled himself as imperator caesar divi filius commander caesar son of the deified one name eck 50   with this title he boasted his familial link to deified julius caesar and the use of  signified a permanent link to the roman tradition of victory name eck 50   the word caesar was merely a cognomen for one branch of the  yet augustus transformed caesar into a new family line that began with him name eck 50  
augustus was granted the right to hang the  above his door the civic crown made from oak and to have laurels drape his doorposts name ccaa 24eder 2005 24  this crown was usually held above the head of a roman general during a  with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat to the general  or remember that you are mortal additionally laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic racing and dramatic contests thus both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of roman religion and statecraft placing them on augustus doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital 
however augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a  wearing a  or wearing the golden crown and purple  of his predecessor julius caesar name ccaa 13eder 2005 13  if he used to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person the senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the  bearing the inscription virtus pietas clementia iustitia—valor piety clemency and justice name ccaa 24   name eck 3eck 2003 3 
by 23ampnbspbc some of the un republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27ampnbspbc augustus policy of holding of an annual consulate drew attention to his dominance over the roman political system at the same time cutting in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still purported to be the head of the roman state   what does this sentence mean   wells p 51  further he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew  follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the principate in his turn group noteif the testimony of  can be believed where during his trial for illegally launching a war in thrace he asserted that he acted on the orders of marcellus and augustusampnbsp– see southern p 108 and eck 2003 p 55  alienating his three biggest supportersampnbsp– agrippa  and liviaholland p 294  feeling pressure from his own core group of adherents augustus turned to the senate for help

in the late spring augustus suffered a severe illness and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the principate in some formsouthern p 108 holland p 295  while at the same time put into doubt the senators suspicions of his anti republicanism name ccaa 25eder 2005 25  name eck 56eck 2003 56  augustus prepared to hand down his  to his favored general agrippa name ccaa 25   name eck 56   however augustus handed over to his co consul piso all of his official documents an account of public finances and authority over listed troops in the provinces while augustus supposedly favored nephew marcellus came away empty handed name ccaa 25   name eck 56   this was a surprise to many who believed augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor name ccaa 38gruen 2005 38 
augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican minded romans fearful of monarchy name ccaa 38 39gruen 2005 38–39  with regards to the principate it was obvious to augustus that marcellus was not ready to take on his position name stern gaius p 23stern gaius women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae a study of augustus vision of a new world order in 13 bc p 23  nonetheless by giving his signet ring to agrippa it was augustus intent to signal to the legions that agrippa was to be his successor and that no matter what the constitutional rules were they would continue to obey agrippaholland pp 294–295 southern p 108 
soon after his bout of illness subsided augustus gave up his annual consulship name eck 56   the only other times augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2ampnbspbc name eck 56   name ccaa 26eder 2005 26  both times to introduce his grandsons into public life name davies p 259   this was a clever ploy by augustus his ceasing to perennially be one of two annual consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position while at the same time augustus could exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class name ccaa 36   although augustus had resigned as consul he desired to retain his consular  not just in his provinces but throughout the empire this desire along with the marcus primus affair led to a second compromise between him and the senate known as the second settlement name eck 57eck 2003 57 
the primary reasons for the second settlement were as follows first after augustus relinquished the annual consulship he was no longer in an official position to rule the state yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his roman imperial provinces where he was still a  name eck 56   name ccaa 37gruen 2005 37  when he annually held the office of consul he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the senate throughout the empire when he deemed necessary name eck 56 57eck 2003 56–57  when he relinquished his annual consulship he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces augustus wanted to keep this power
a second problem later arose showing the need for the second settlement in what became known as the marcus primus affair name southern p 109southern p 109 holland p 299  in late 24 or early 23ampnbspbc charges were brought against marcus primus the former proconsul governor of macedonia for waging a war without prior approval of the senate on the  kingdom of  whose king was a roman allywells p 53  he was defended by  who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from augustus ordering him to attack the client state name southern p 108southern p 108  later primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased marcellusholland p 300  such orders had they been given would have been considered a breach of the senates prerogative under the constitutional settlement of 27 bc and its aftermath — ie before augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius — as macedonia was a senatorial province under the senates jurisdiction not an imperial province under the authority of augustus such an action would have ripped away the veneer of republican restoration as promoted by augustus and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen a first among equals name southern p 108   even worse the involvement of marcellus provided some measure of proof that augustuss policy was to have the youth take his place as princeps instituting a form of monarchyampnbsp– accusations that had already played out name stern gaius p 23  
the situation was so serious that augustus himself appeared at the trial even though he had not been called as a witness under oath augustus declared that he gave no such ordersyme p 333  murena disbelieved augustuss testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his  he rudely demanded to know why augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called augustus replied that he came in the public interestsyme p 333 holland p 300 southern pg 108  although primus was found guilty some jurors voted to acquit meaning that not everybody believed augustuss testimony an insult to the august onewells p 53 raaflaub p 426 
the second constitutional settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize augustus legal authority to intervene in senatorial provinces the senate granted augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare or proconsular imperium power that applied throughout the empire not solely to his provinces moreover the senate augmented augustus proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more maius or greater than that held by the other proconsuls this in effect gave augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire name eck 57   augustus stayed in rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13ampnbspbc name ccaa 26  
during the second settlement augustus was also granted the power of a  tribunicia potestas for life though not the official title of tribune name eck 57   for some years augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas or the immunity from physical attack given to a  now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy in perpetuity legally it was closed to  a status that augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by julius caesar name ccaa 36gruen 2005 36  this power allowed him to convene the senate and people at will and lay business before them to veto the actions of either the assembly or the senate to preside over elections and to speak first at any meeting name ccaa 26   name eck 57 58eck 2003 57–58  also included in augustus tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the  these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest as well as the ability to hold a  and determine the membership of the senate name eck 59eck 2003 59 
with the powers of a censor augustus appealed to virtues of roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the forum name ccaa 30eder 2005 30  there was no precedent within the roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position nor was augustus ever elected to the office of censor name bunson 80bunson 1994 80  julius caesar had been granted similar powers wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state   however this position did not extend to the censors ability to hold a census and determine the senates roster the office of the tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to augustus amassing of tribunal powers so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the ship name bunson 427bunson 1994 427 
augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of rome itself in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life traditionally proconsuls roman province governors lost their proconsular imperium when they crossed the pomerium   the sacred boundary of rome   and entered the city in these situations augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul that would mean that when he was in the city he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority thanks to his prestige or auctoritas his wishes would usually be obeyed but there might be some difficulty to fill this power vacuum the senate voted that augustuss imperium proconsulare maius superior proconsular power should not lapse when he was inside the city walls all armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of augustus name eck 60eck 2003 60 
in addition the credit was given to augustus for each subsequent roman military victory after this time because the majority of romes armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by augustus through the  who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces name eck 61   moreover if a battle was fought in a senatorial province augustus proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of or credit for any major military victory this meant that augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph a tradition that began with romulus romes first king and first triumphant general name eck 61eck 2003 61   was the last man outside augustus family to receive this award in 19ampnbspbc name eck 61   balbus was the nephew of julius caesars great agent who was governor of africa and conqueror of the  tiberius augustus eldest son by marriage to livia was the only other general to receive a triumph — for victories in germania in 7ampnbspbc name eck 117eck 2003 117 
many of the political subtleties of the second settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the plebeian class who were augustus greatest supporters and clientele this caused them to insist upon augustus participation in imperial affairs from time to time augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22ampnbspbc and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic senate in 22 21 and 19ampnbspbc the people rioted in response and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years ostensibly to leave the other position open for augustusdio http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts cassius_dio 54html#1 541 http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts cassius_dio 54html#6 6 http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts cassius_dio 54html#10 10  likewise there was a food shortage in rome in 22ampnbspbc which sparked panic while many urban plebs called for augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis name ccaa 26   after a theatrical display of usal before the senate augustus finally accepted authority over romes grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium and ended the crisis almost immediately name ccaa 26   it was not until ad 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted augustus to establish a praefectus annonae a permanent pect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for rome name eck 78eck 2003 78 
nevertheless there were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to augustus by the second settlement and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of fannius caepio name southern p 109  some time prior to 1 september 22 bc a certain castricius provided augustus with information about a conspiracy led by fannius caepioswan p 241 syme p 483   was named among the conspirators the outspoken consul who defended primus in the marcus primus affair the conspirators were tried in absentia with tiberius acting as prosecutor the jury found them guilty but it was not a unanimous verdictwells p 53 holland p 301  all the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defencedavies p 260 holland p 301  augustus ensured that the facade of republican government continued with an effective cover up of the eventsholland p 301 
in 19ampnbspbc the senate granted augustus a form of general consular imperium which was probably imperium consulare maius like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 bc like his tribune authority the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold name ccaa 43   in addition augustus was allowed to wear the consuls insignia in public and before the senate name eck 60   as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the  an emblem of consular authority name ccaa 43gruen 2005 43  this seems to have assuaged the populace regardless of whether or not augustus was a consul the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary on 6 march 12ampnbspbc after the death of  he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus the high priest of the collegium of the pontifices the most important position in roman religionbowersock 1990 p 380 the date is provided by inscribed calendars see also augustus  http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts augustus res_gestae 2html#10 102 dio http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts cassius_dio 54html#272 272 reports this under 13ampnbspbc probably as the year in which lepidus died bowersock 1990 p 383  name ccaa 28eder 2005 28  on 5 february 2ampnbspbc augustus was also given the title  or father of the countrymackay 2004 186  name eck 129eck 2003 129 
a final reason for the second settlement was to give the principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to princeps augustus his illness of early 23 bc and the caepio conspiracy showed that the regimes existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man augustus himself who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life augustus http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts suetonius 12caesars augustushtml#81 81  if he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination rome could be subjected to another round of civil war the memories of pharsalus the ides of march the proscriptions philippi and actium barely twenty five years distant were still vivid in the minds of many citizens proconsular imperium was conferred upon  for five years similar to augustus power in order to accomplish this constitutional stability the exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered augustus imperial provinces east and west perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the senate that came later as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestassyme 1939 337 338 
augustus powers were now complete in fact he dated his reign from the completion of the second settlement july 1 23 bceverett 2006 217  almost as importantly the principate now had constitutional stability later roman emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to augustus though often newly appointed emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to augustus in order to display humility just as often as their reign progressed emperors would appropriate all of the titles regardless of whether they had been granted them by the senate later emperors took to wearing the civic crown consular insignia and the purple robes of a triumphant general  which became the imperial insignia well into the  era
imperator caesar divi filius augustus chose imperator victorious commander to be his first name since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory name eck 93eck 2003 93  by the year 13 augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed imperator as his title after a successful battle name eck 93   almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the res gestae was devoted to his military victories and honors name eck 93  
augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior roman civilization with a task of ruling the world to the extent to which the romans knew it a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet  attributes to a legendary ancestor of augustus tu regere imperio populos romane memento—roman remember by your strength to rule the earths peoples name ccaa 30   the impulse for  apparently was prominent among all classes at rome and it is accorded divine sanction by virgils jupiter in book 1 of the  where jupiter promises rome imperium sine fine sovereignty without end name eck 95eck 2003 95

conquering the peoples of the alps in 16ampnbspbc was another important victory for rome since it provided a large territorial buffer between the roman citizens of italy and romes enemies in germania to the north name eck 98eck 2003 98   dedicated an ode to the victory while the monument  near  was built to honor the occasion name eck 98 99eck 2003 98–99  the capture of the alpine region also served the next offensive in 12ampnbspbc when tiberius began the offensive against the pannonian tribes of illyricum and his brother  moved against the germanic tribes of the eastern  name eck 99eck 2003 99  both campaigns were successful as drusus forces reached the  river by 9ampnbspbc—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse name eck 99   it was recorded that the pious tiberius walked in front of his brothers body all the way back to rome name bunson 416  
to protect romes eastern territories from the  augustus relied on the s of the east to act as territorial  and areas that could raise their own troops for defense name eck 96eck 2003 96  to ensure security of the empires eastern flank augustus stationed a roman army in syria while his skilled stepson tiberius negotiated with the parthians as romes diplomat to the east name eck 96   tiberius was responsible for restoring  to the throne of the kingdom of armenia name bunson 416

a prime example of roman loss in battle was the  in ad 9 where three entire legions led by  were destroyed by  leader of the  an apparent roman ally name eck 101 102eck 2003 101–102  augustus retaliated by dispatching tiberius and drusus to the rhineland to pacify it which had some success although the battle of ad 9 brought the end to roman expansion into germany name bunson 417bunson 1994 417  roman general  took advantage of a cherusci civil war between arminius and  they defeated arminius who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery name bunson 31bunson 1994 31 
the illness of augustus in 23ampnbspbc brought the problem of succession to the foront of political issues and the public to ensure stability he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in roman society and government this was to be achieved in small undramatic and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy name ccaa 50   if someone was to succeed augustus unofficial position of power he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits name ccaa 50gruen 2005 50 
some augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sisters son  who had been quickly married to augustus daughter  name eck 114 115eck 2003 114–115  other historians dispute this due to augustus will read aloud to the senate while he was seriously ill in 23ampnbspbc name eck 115eck 2003 115  instead indicating a perence for marcus agrippa who was augustus second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the empire together name ccaa 44  
after the death of marcellus in 23ampnbspbc augustus married his daughter to agrippa this union produced five children three sons and two daughters     and  so named because he was born after marcus agrippa died shortly after the second settlement agrippa was granted a five year term of administering the eastern half of the empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to augustus although not trumping augustus authority his seat of governance stationed at  in the eastern  name ccaa 44gruen 2005 44  name eck 58eck 2003 58  this granting of power showed augustus favor for agrippa but it was also a measure to please members of his caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him name eck 58  
augustus intent became apparent to make gaius and lucius caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own childrensyme 1939 416–417  he took the consulship in 5 and 2ampnbspbc so that he could personally usher them into their political careersscullard 1982 217  and they were nominated for the consulships of ad 1 and 4syme 1939 417  augustus also showed favor to his stepsons livias children from her first marriage  henceforth erred to as drusus and  henceforth tiberius granting them military commands and public office though seeming to favor drusus after agrippa died in 12ampnbspbc tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife vipsania and marry agrippas widow augustus daughter juliaampnbsp— as soon as a period of mourning for agrippa had ended name eck 116eck 2003 116  drusus marriage to antonia was considered an unbreakable affair whereas vipsania was only the daughter of the late agrippa from his first marriage name eck 116

the only other possible claimant as heir was postumus agrippa who had been exiled by augustus in ad 7 his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree and augustus officially disowned him name ccaa 49   he certainly fell out of augustus favor as an heir the historian erich s gruen notes various contemporary sources that state postumus agrippa was a vulgar young man brutal and brutish and of depraved character name ccaa 49gruen 2005 49  postumus agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of augustus

alternatively it is possible that livia did supply a poisoned fig she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that augustus is said to have enjoyed but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder augustus health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power having at last reluctantly settled on tiberius as his choice of heir name eck 123eck 2003 123  it is likely that augustus was not expected to return alive from nola but it seems that his health improved once there it has theore been speculated that augustus and livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time having committed all political process to accepting tiberius in order to not endanger that transition name everitt

historian d c a shotter states that augustus policy of favoring the julian family line over the claudian might have afforded tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for augustus after the latters death instead tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized augustusshotter 1966 210–212  shotter suggests that augustus deification obliged tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored coupled with tiberius extremely conservative attitude towards religion name shotter 211shotter 1966 211 
also historian r shaw smith points to letters of augustus to tiberius which display affection towards tiberius and high regard for his military merits name shaw smith 213   shotter states that tiberius focused his anger and criticism on  for marrying vipsania after augustus forced tiberius to divorce her as well as toward the two young caesars gaius and lucius—instead of augustus the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion name shotter 211  
augustus reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted in one form or another for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate  and until the  in 1453 both his adoptive surname caesar and his title augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of the roman empire for fourteen centuries after his death in use both at  and at  in many languages caesar became the word for emperor as in the german  and in the bulgarian and subsequently russian  the cult of divus augustus continued until the state religion of the empire was changed to  in 391 by  consequently there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor he had composed an account of his achievements the  to be inscribed in bronze in front of suetonius augustus http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts suetonius 12caesars augustushtml#1014 1014  copies of the text were inscribed throughout the empire upon his death name eck 1 2eck 2003 1–2  the inscriptions in latin featured translations in greek beside it and were inscribed on many public edifices such as the temple in  dubbed the monumentum ancyranum called the queen of inscriptions by historian  name eck 2eck 2003 2 
there are a few known written works by augustus that have survived such as his poems sicily epiphanus and ajax an autobiography of 13 books a philosophical treatise and his written rebuttal to brutus eulogy of cato name bunson 47bunson 1994 47  historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life name shaw smith 213shaw smith 1971 213 bourne 1918 53–66 
many consider augustus to be romes greatest emperor his policies certainly extended the empires life span and initiated the celebrated pax romana or pax augusta the roman senate wished subsequent emperors to  augustus was intelligent decisive and a shrewd politician but he was not perhaps as charismatic as julius caesar and was influenced on occasion by his third wife livia sometimes for the worse nevertheless his legacy proved more enduring the city of rome was utterly transformed under augustus with romes first institutionalized   force and the establishment of the municipal  as a permanent office name eck 79   the police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1000 men each with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors name eck 79  
a praefectus vigilum or pect of the watch was put in charge of the  romes fire brigade and police name bunson 345bunson 1994 345  with romes civil wars at an end augustus was also able to create a  for the roman empire fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170000 soldiers name eck 85 86eck 2003 85–87  this was supported by numerous  units of 500 soldiers each often recruited from recently conquered areas name eck 86eck 2003 86 
with his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout italy augustus also installed an official  system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum name eck 81   besides the advent of swifter communication among italian polities his extensive building of roads throughout italy also allowed romes armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country name chisholm 122chisholm 1981 122  in the year 6 augustus established the  donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers name bunson 6bunson 1994 6 
one of the most enduring institutions of augustus was the establishment of the praetorian guard in 27ampnbspbc originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in rome name bunson 341bunson 1994 341  they had the power to intimidate the senate install new emperors and depose ones they disliked the last emperor they served was  as it was  who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks the  name bunson 341 342bunson 1994 341–342 
although the most powerful individual in the roman empire augustus wished to embody the spirit of republican virtue and norms he also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people he achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess in the year 29ampnbspbc augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250000 citizens 1000 sesterces each to 120000 veterans in the colonies and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon name ccaa 23   he also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the  of deities name ccaa 23eder 2005 23  in 28ampnbspbc he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest name ccaa 23  
the longevity of augustus reign and its legacy to the roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success as  wrote the younger generations alive in ad 14 had never known any form of government other than the principatetacitus    had augustus died earlier in 23ampnbspbc for instance matters might have turned out differently the attrition of the civil wars on the old republican oligarchy and the longevity of augustus theore must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the roman state into a  monarchy in these years augustus own experience his patience his tact and his political acumen also played their parts he directed the future of the empire down many lasting paths from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession to the embellishment of the capital at the emperors expense augustus ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated his memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor every emperor of rome adopted his name caesar augustus which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title name eck 124   the augustan era poets virgil and horace praised augustus as a defender of rome an upholder of moral justice and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire name kelsall 120kelsall 1976 120 
however for his rule of rome and establishing the principate augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages the contemporary roman jurist  d ad 10 11 fond of the days of pre augustan republican  in which he had been born openly criticized the augustan regime name starr 5starr 1952 5  in the beginning of his  the roman historian  c 56–c117 wrote that augustus had cunningly subverted republican rome into a position of slavery name starr 5   he continued to say that with augustus death and swearing of loyalty to tiberius the people of rome simply traded one slaveholder for another name starr 5   tacitus however records two contradictory but common views of augustus
according to the second opposing opinion
in a recent biography on augustus  asserts that through the centuries judgments on augustus reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that
tacitus was of the belief that  r 96–98 successfully mingled two formerly alien ideas principate and liberty name starr 6starr 1952 6  the 3rd century historian cassius dio acknowledged augustus as a benign moderate ruler yet like most other historians after the death of augustus dio viewed augustus as an  name starr 5   the poet  ad 39–65 was of the opinion that caesars victory over pompey and the fall of  95 bc–46ampnbspbc marked the end of traditional liberty in rome historian chester g starr jr writes of his avoidance of criticizing augustus perhaps augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly name starr 6  
the  writer  1667–1745 in his discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome criticized augustus for installing tyranny over rome and likened what he believed s virtuous  to romes moral republic of the 2nd century bc name kelsall 118kelsall 1976 118  in his criticism of augustus the admiral and historian  1658–1741 compared augustus to the puritanical tyrant  1599–1658 name kelsall 118   thomas gordon and the  political philosopher  1689–1755 both remarked that augustus was a coward in battle name kelsall 119kelsall 1976 119  in his memoirs of the court of augustus the  scholar  1701–1757 deemed augustus a  a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper wicked and worthless a mean spirit and a tyrant name kelsall 119  
augustus public  orms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the empire augustus brought a far greater portion of the empires expanded land base under consistent direct taxation from rome instead of exacting varying intermittent and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as augustus predecessors had done name eck 83 84   this orm greatly increased romes net revenue from its territorial acquisitions stabilized its flow and regularized the financial relationship between rome and the provinces rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute name eck 83 84eck 2003 83–84 
the measures of taxation in the reign of augustus were determined by population census with fixed quotas for each province name bunson 404bunson 1994 404  citizens of rome and italy paid indirect taxes while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces name bunson 404   indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves a 1% tax on goods sold at auction and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100000 sesterces by persons other than the  name bunson 404  
an equally important orm was the abolition of private  which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors private contractors that raised taxes had been the norm in the republican era and some had grown powerful enough to influence the amount of votes for politicians in rome name eck 83 84   the tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations as well as great private wealth by winning the right to tax local areas name eck 83 84  
romes revenue was the amount of the successful bids and the tax farmers profits consisted of any additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with romes blessing lack of effective supervision combined with tax farmers desire to maximize their profits had produced a system of arbitrary exactions that was often barbarously cruel to taxpayers widely and accurately perceived as unfair and very harmful to investment and the economy
the use of egypts immense land rents to finance the empires operations resulted from augustus conquest of egypt and the shift to a roman form of government name bunson 144bunson 1994 144  as it was effectively considered augustus private property rather than a province of the empire it became part of each succeeding emperors patrimonium name bunson 144 145bunson 1994 144–145  instead of a legate or proconsul augustus installed a pect from the equestrian class to administer egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming  name bunson 145bunson 1994 145  the highly productive agricultural land of egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions name bunson 144   as well as  for the population of rome
during his reign the  resulted in the murder of 3500  name woolf2007 
the month of august latin augustus is named after augustus until his time it was called  named so because it had been the sixth month of the original  and the latin word for six is sex commonly repeated lore has it that august has 31 days because augustus wanted his month to match the length of julius caesars july but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar  sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed and it was not chosen for its length see  according to a senatus consultum quoted by  sextilis was renamed to honor augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power culminating in the fall of alexandria fell in that monthmacrobius saturnalia http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer l roman texts macrobius saturnalia 1html#1235 11235 
on his deathbed augustus boasted i found a rome of bricks i leave to you one of marble although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this cassius dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the empires strength name dio 56303dio http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts cassius_dio 56html#30 56303   could be found in buildings of rome before augustus but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of augustus name bunson 34  
although this did not apply to the  slums which were still as rickety and fire prone as ever he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the  with the  altar of peace and monumental sundial whose central  was an  taken from egypt name eck 122eck 2003 122  the  sculptures decorating the ara pacis visually augmented the written record of augustus triumphs in the res gestae name bunson 32bunson 1994 32  its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the ians the vestals and the citizenry of rome name bunson 32

after the death of agrippa in 12ampnbspbc a solution had to be found in maintaining romes water supply system this came about because it was overseen by agrippa when he served as aedile and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense name eck 79eck 2003 79  in that year augustus arranged a system where the senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that romes aqueducts did not fall into disrepair name eck 79  
in the late augustan era the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum translated as supervisors of public property was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult name eck 79   augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum translated as supervisors for roads for the upkeep of roads this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs name eck 81eck 2003 81 
the  of architectural style originating from ancient greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of augustus and the imperial phase of rome name bunson 34bunson 1994 34  suetonius once commented that rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital yet augustus and agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of rome upon the classical greek model name bunson 34  
his biographer suetonius writing about a century after augustus death described his appearance as ampnbspunusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life though he cared nothing for personal adornment he was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing somethingampnbsp he had clear bright eyesampnbsp his teeth were wide apart small and ill kept his hair was slightly curly and inclining to  his eyebrows met his ears were of moderate size and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward his complexion was between dark and fair he was short of stature although julius marathus his freedman and keeper of his records says that he was five feet and nine inches more or less 175 meter in height but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside himampnbsp suetonius augustus http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts suetonius 12caesars augustushtml#79 79 translated by  
his official images were very tightly controlled and idealized drawing from a tradition of  royal portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in  he first appeared on  at the age of 19 and from about 29 bc the explosion in the number of augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil religious economic and military life with augustus personwalker and burnett pp 1 18 25 quoted  the early images did indeed depict a young man but although there were gradual changes his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies by which time they had a distanced air of ageless majestysmith 186  among the best known of many surviving portraits are the  the image on the ara pacis and the  which shows him as a priest several  include the  and

transport in antarctica has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of   to a more open area due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport predominantly by air and water as well as land 
transportation technologies on a remote area like antarctica need to be able to deal with extremely low s and continuous s to ensure the travelers safety due to the fragility of the antarctic environment only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the 
the  of land water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable 
currently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists a year rely on the antarctic transportation system
a normal car on tires has very limited
capability for antarctica conditions 
scientific bases are often built on snow free areas oasis close to the
ocean  around these stations and on a
hard packed snow or ice tire based vehicles can drive but on deeper and softer
snow a normal tire based vehicle cannot travel  due to these limitation vehicles on belts have
been the perred option in antarctica  
in 1997 two specialized cars with very large tires running tire pressure
as low as 15psi 01bar travelled onto the high antarctica plateau giving
strong indication that tire based vehicles could be and option for efficient travelling
in antarctica
 started using classic s the first production cars to be used in antarctica the first of these was named antarctica 1 however the scarcity and poor quality of  infrastructure limits land transportation by conventional vehicles winds continuously blow snow on the roads the  also called mcmurdo – south pole highway is a  900 mile 1450ampnbspkm road in antarctica linking the united states  on the coast to the 
in december 1997 into february 1998 two
at44 4x4 cars built in iceland by arctic trucks with tire size of 44 inch
tall joined an expedition by the swedish polar institution swea  the cars got used to transport people and
supplies from the ice shelf to wasa station to perform scanning of the snow
and support a drilling expedition to on the antarctica plateau 76°s 8°03’w  this is the first time tire based vehicles
successfully travel on the antarctica high plateau
in 2006 a team of six people took part in the  travelling in a specially designed six wheel drive vehicle the team completed the journey from the  coast at patriot hills to the geographic  in 69 hours in doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days they arrived at the south pole on the 12th of december 2005http  wwwicechallengercouk  ice challenger 2005    bot generated title    retrieved on 2008 10 14 
the team members on that expedition were   andrew moon richard griffiths gunnar egilsson and andrew miles the expedition successfully showed that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also often more practical the expedition also hoped to raise awareness about global warming and climate change
from start of december 2008 into february
2009 four at44 4x4 cars were used to support a ski race by amundsen omega 3 from
s82° 41 e17° 43 to south pole   a film
was made of this race by bbc called „on thin ice“ with ben fogle and james
cracknell   the cars started from novo
airbase at s70° 49 e11° 38 establish a route onto the plateau through the crevasse
areas in the shcherbakov mountain range driving nearly 1500ampnbspkm to the start line
of the ski race  for the return journey
each car covered between 5400 and 5800ampnbspkm with one fuel depot on the way
from 2008 to date dec 2015 tire based
cars at44 4x4 and at44 6x6 have been used every season to support various ngo‘s
and scientific expedition projects supporting flights fuel drops filming
skiers biker a tractor collecting snow samples and more  the combined distance covered on the
antarctica plateau is over 220 thousand km and even though towing capacity is
much lower than for most belt based vehicles the tire based cars multiply the
travel speed and use only a fraction of the fuel making this a very valid
option for some expeditions projects
a second expedition led by andrew regan and andrew moon departed in november 2010 the moon regan trans antarctic expedition this time traversed the entire continent twice using two six wheel drive vehicles and a concept ice vehicle designed by lotushttp  wwwtransantarcticexpeditioncom  trans antarctic expedition    bot generated title    retrieved on 2011 02 20  this time the team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the antarctic region and to show that  can be a viable and environmentally friendly option
antarcticas only harbour is at  most coastal stations have offshore anchorages and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats barges and helicopters a few stations have a basic wharf facility all ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with article 7  offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent but poses no problem to sailboats designed for the ice typically with lifting keels and long shorelines
    government use only except by permit see permit office under legal system a number of tour boats ranging from large motorized vessels to small sailing yachts visit the antarctic peninsula during the summer months january–march most are based in  argentina
transport in antarctica takes place by air using  and s
runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions
antarctica has  but there are no developed public access airports or landing facilities thirty stations operated by 16 national governments party to the  have landing facilities for either s and or  commercial enterprises operate two additional air facilities
helicopter pads are available at 27 stations runways at 15 locations are gravel sea ice blue ice or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled fixed wing aircraft of these 1 is greater than 3ampnbspkm in length 6 are between 2ampnbspkm and 3ampnbspkm in length 3 are between 1ampnbspkm and 2ampnbspkm in length 3 are less than 1ampnbspkm in length and 2 are of unknown length snow surface skiways limited to use by  equipped fixed wing aircraft are available at another 15 locations of these 4 are greater than 3ampnbspkm in length 3 are between 2ampnbspkm and 3ampnbspkm in length 2 are between 1ampnbspkm and 2ampnbspkm in length 2 are less than 1ampnbspkm in length and data is unavailable for the remaining 4
antarctic airports are subject to severe restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions they do not meet  standards and advance approval from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization is required for landing 1999 est flights to the continent in the permanent darkness of the winter are normally only undertaken in an emergency with burning barrels of fuel to outline a runway on september 11 2008 a united states air force  successfully completed the first landing in antarctica using  at

this article will go through a wide range of topics of the geography of the state of  it is 30th in size and borders four s mississippi tennessee georgia and florida it also borders the gulf of mexico
extending entirely across the state of alabama for about  northern boundary and in the middle stretching  farther south is the  or  region broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers in the northern part of this plateau west of  there are about  of level highlands from  above sea level south of these highlands occupying a narrow strip on each side of the  is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from   to the northeast of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain sides deep narrow coves and valleys and flat mountain tops  its elevations range from   in the remainder of this region the southern portion the most prominent feature is little mountain extending about  from east to west between two valleys and rising precipitously on the north side  above them or  above the sea
adjoining the cumberland plateau region on the southeast is the  locally known as coosa valley region which is the southern extremity of the  and occupies an area within the state of about   this is a  belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains  although the general direction of the mountains ridges and valleys is northeast and southwest irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics  in the northeast are several flat topped mountains of which raccoon and  are the most prominent having a maximum elevation near the  line of little more than  and gradually decreasing in height toward the southwest where  is a continuation of raccoon  south of these the mountains are marked by steep northwest sides sharp crests and gently sloping southeast sides
southeast of the appalachian valley region the  also crosses the alabama border from the ne and occupies a small triangular shaped section of which  and  counties together with the northern part of  and  form the principal portion  its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about  above sea level  the piedmont plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks then uplifted to form a plateau
the remainder of the state is occupied by the coastal plain  this is crossed by foot hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state where it has a mean elevation of about  becomes lower and more level toward the southwest and in the extreme south is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea
the cumberland plateau region is drained to the west northwest by the  and its tributaries all other parts of the state are drained to the southwest in the appalachian valley region the  is the principal river and in the piedmont plateau the   in the coastal plain are the  in the west the  formed by the coosa and tallapoosa in the western central and in the east the  which forms almost half of the georgia boundary  the tombigbee and alabama rivers unite near the southwest corner of the state their waters discharging into  by the  and tensas rivers  the  is a considerable stream which joins the tombigbee from the east
the valleys in the north and northeast are usually deep and narrow but in the coastal plain they are broad and in most cases rise in three successive terraces above the stream  the harbour of mobile was formed by the drowning of the lower part of the valley of the alabama and tombigbee rivers as a result of the sinking of the land here such sinking having occurred on other parts of the gulf coast

the fauna and flora of alabama are similar to those of the gulf states in general and have no distinctive characteristics however the  system has a high incidence of endemism among freshwater mollusks and biodiversity is high
in alabama vast forests of  constitute the largest proportion of the states forest growth there is also an abundance of     and  trees in other areas  growths in the north and  in the southwest other native trees include   and  in the gulf region of the state grow various species of  and  in alabama there are more than 150 s including  and  among cultivated plants are  and 
while in the past the state enjoyed a variety of mammals such as     and  only the  remains abundant still fairly common are the          and es and   and  have been introduced to the state and now also common
alabama’s birds include  and s  and other s  and s game birds include    and  freshwater fish such as    and  are common along the gulf coast there are seasonal runs of    and  name   gale 
the  lists as  99 animals fish and birds and 18 plant species  the endangered animals include the     and s  and

the heat of summer is tempered in the south by the winds from the  and in the north by the elevation above the sea the average annual temperature is highest in the southwest along the coast and lowest in the northeast among the highlands thus at mobile the annual mean is 67 °f 19 °c the mean for the summer 81 °f 27 °c and for the winter 52 °f 11 °c and at valley head in de kalb county the annual mean is 59 °f 15 °c the mean for the summer 75 °f 24 °c and for the winter 41 °f 5 °c at montgomery in the central region the average annual temperature is 66 °f 19 °c with a winter average of 49 °f 9 °c and a summer average of 81 °f 27 °c the average winter minimum for the entire state is 35 °f 2 °c and there is an average of 35 days in each year in which the thermometer falls below the freezing point at extremely rare intervals the thermometer has fallen below zero  18 °c as was the case in the remarkable cold wave of the 12th 13 february 1899 when an absolute minimum of  17 °f  29 °c was registered at  the highest temperature ever recorded was 109 °f 43 °c in  county in 1902
the amount of precipitation is greatest along the coast 62ampnbspinches 1574ampnbspmm and evenly distributed through the rest of the state about 52ampnbspinches 1320ampnbspmm during each winter there is usually one fall of snow in the south and two in the north but the snow quickly disappears and sometimes during an entire winter the ground is not covered with snow  heavy snowfall can occur such as during the  and the  storms occur occasionally in the spring and summer but are seldom destructive heavy s are rare and are confined chiefly to the coast s occur throughout the year   they are most common in the summer but most severe in the spring and fall when destructive winds and es occasionally occur the prevailing winds are from the news  are quite common in the state especially in the southern part and major hurricanes occasionally strike the coast which can be very destructive
as regards its soil alabama may be divided into four regions  extending from the gulf northward for about 150 miles 240ampnbspkm is the outer belt of the coastal plain also called the timber belt whose soil is sandy and poor but responds well to fertilization  north of this is the inner lowland of the coastal plain or the black prairie which includes some  and seventeen counties  it receives its name from its soil weathered from the weak underlying limestone which is black in colour almost destitute of sand and loam and rich in limestone and marl formations especially adapted to the production of cotton hence the region is also called the cotton belt between the cotton belt and the  is the  region the old land area—a region of resistant rocks—whose soils also derived from weathering in silu are of varied fertility the best coming from the granites sandstones and limestones the poorest from the gneisses schists and slates  north of the mineral region is the cereal belt embracing the tennessee valley and the counties beyond whose richest soils are the red clays and dark loams of the river valley north of which are less fertile soils produced by siliceous and sandstone formations

apocrypha are works usually written works that are of unknown authorship or of doubtful authenticity or spurious or not considered to be within a particular canon the word is properly treated as a plural but in common usage is often singularlittle williams  onions ct editors the oxford universal dictionary oxford university press 1955   in the context of the jewish and christian bibles where most texts are of unknown authorship apocrypha usually ers to a set of texts included in the  but not in the 
the words origin is the  adjective apocryphus secret or non canonical from the  adjective  apokryphos obscure from the verb  apokryptein to hide away 
apocrypha is commonly applied in christian religious contexts involving certain disagreements about icity  apocryphal  writings are a class of documents  rejected by some as being worthy to properly be called scripture though as with other writings they may sometimes be erenced for support while writings that are now accepted by christians as scripture were recognized as being such by various believers early on the establishment of a largely settled uniform canon was a process of centuries and what the term canonas well as apocrypha precisely meant also saw development  the canonical process took place with believers recognizing writings as being of god subsequently being followed official affirmation of what had become largely established name mcdonald  the roman catholic church provided its first dogmatic definition of her entire canon in 1546 which put a stop to doubts and disagreements about the status of the apocrypha as well as certain other books  which had continued from the beginning of the nt church  the leader of the     like the catholic church father  and certain others favored the masoretic canon for the old testament excluding apocryphal books in his non binding canon as being worthy to properly be called scripture but included most of them in a separate section as per jerome  luther also doubted the canonicity of four new testament books hebrews james and jude and revelation and which judgment protestantism did not follow  but he did not title them apocrypha
explaining the  churchs canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the  church in the interpretation of how it was done today orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the catholic canon
the word apocryphal  was first applied to writings which were kept secret because they were the vehicles of  knowledge considered too profound or too sacred to be disclosed to anyone other than the initiated for example the  of the   boasted that they possessed the secret  books of  the term in general enjoyed high consideration among the  see  ppampnbsp10 27 44 name eb1911 
renowned sinologist  ers to texts and even items produced by ancient chinese sages as apocryphal and studied their uses during  china ad 220 to 589  these artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the emperors   examples of these include talismans charts writs tallies and registers  the first examples were stones jade pieces bronze vessels and weapons but came to include talismans and magic diagrams name seidelannaseidel anna imperial treasures and taoist sacraments in m strickmann ed tantric and taoist studies in honor of rolf a stein ii bruxelles institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises pp 291 371  from their roots in  era china 1066 to 256 bc these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the  206 bc to ad 220 most of these texts have been destroyed as emperors particularly during the han dynasty collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals name seidelanna   it is theore fitting with the greek root of the word as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling emperor from challenges to his status as heavens choice as sovereign
   this was originally part of the esoteric writing section but it does not seem to fitit seems to be a separate topic  
apocrypha was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church many in  traditions cite revelation 2218–19 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra biblical writings such as the apocrypha however a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the  rv2218–19f kjv states for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book  in this case if one holds to a strict  the words of the  do not er to the bible as a whole but to jesus revelation to john  in commentaries on matthew distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings  writing not found on the common and published books in one hand actually found on the secret ones on the otherhttp  wwwnewadventorg fathers 1016htm commentaries on matthew x 18 xiii 57  the meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to excluded from the public use of the church and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word name eb1911  
in general use the word apocrypha came to mean false spurious bad or heretical this meaning also appears in origens prologue to his commentary on the  of which only the  translation survives de scripturis his quae appellantur apocryphae pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem name eb1911   concerning these scriptures which are called apocryphal for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority
other uses of apocrypha developed over the history of western christianity  the  generally held now as being  the work an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553 ers to religious works by    and  as apocrypha  defined the word as meaning simply obscurity of origin implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered apocryphal on the other hand  in protogus galeatus declared that all books outside the hebrew canon were apocryphal name eb1911   in practice jerome treated some books outside the hebrew canon as if they were canonical and the western church did not accept jeromes definition of apocrypha instead retaining the words prior meaning see  as a result various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha treating them with varying levels of regard
 
 who stated that the canonical books as the hebrews have handed them down are twenty two   and others cited some apocryphal books as scripture divine scripture inspired and the like on the other hand teachers connected with  and familiar with the  excluded from the canon all of the old testament not found there this view is lected in the canon of  and in the paces and letters of jerome name eb1911   a third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the  collection but were of value for moral uses as introductory texts for new converts from  and to be read in congregations they were erred to as  works by  name eb1911  
these three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the  when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for s and s alike in 1546 the catholic  reconfirmed the canon of augustine dating to the second and third centuries declaring he is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books with all their parts as they have been accustomed to be read in the catholic church and are found in the ancient editions of the latin  as sacred and canonical the whole of the books in question with the exception of  and  and the  were declared canonical at trent name eb1911   the protestants in comparison  were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on some considered them divinely inspired others rejected them anglicans took a position between the catholic church and the protestant churches they kept them as christian intertestamental readings and a part of the bible but no doctrine should be based on them  a 14th century christian humanist had declared in his biblical translation that whatever book is in the old testament besides these twenty five shall be set among the apocrypha that is without authority or belief name eb1911   nevertheless his translation of the bible included the  and the  
martin luther did not class apocryphal books as being scripture but in both the  1534 and  1535 translations of the bible the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books although the lutheran and anglican lists are different in some editions like the westminster readers were warned that these books were not to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings a milder distinction was expressed elsewhere such as in the argument introducing them in the  and in the sixth article of the  where it is said that the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners though not to establish doctrine name eb1911    among some other protestants  the term apocryphal began to take on extra or altered connotations not just of dubious authenticity but having spurious or false content name mcdonald   not just obscure but having hidden or suspect motives  protestants were and are not unanimous in adopting those meanings the  agreed and that view continues today throughout the  the worldwide  and many other denominations  whichever implied meaning is intended apocrypha was and is used primarily by protestants in erence to the books of questioned canonicity  and  sometimes avoid using the term in contexts where it might be disputatious or be misconstrued as yielding on the point of canonicity  thus the respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between protestant denominations most protestant published bibles that include the apocryphal books will relocate them into a separate section rather like an appendix so as not to intermingle them with their canonical books
according to the 
with few exceptions the 66 book protestantism canon such as listed in the   of 1646  has been well established for centuries and with many today contending against the apocrypha using various arguments   
the adjective apocryphal is commonly used in modern english to er to any text or story considered to be of dubious veracity or authority although it may contain some moral truth in this broader metaphorical sense the word suggests a claim that is in the nature of   or 
although traditional rabbinical judaism insists on the exclusive canonization of the current 24 books in the  it also claims to have an oral law handed down from  the —unlike the  but like the —seem to have maintained an earlier and smaller number of texts as canonical perring to hold to only what was written in the law of moses  making most of the presently accepted canon both jewish and christian apocryphal in their eyes  certain circles in judaism such as the s in judea and the  in  were said to have a secret literature see  other traditions maintained different customs regarding canonicityhttp  wwwcolumbiaedu cu augustine arch sbrandt canonhtm the old testament canon  the ethiopic jews for instance seem to have retained a spread of canonical texts similar to the http  gbgm umcorg umw bible etholdstm ethiopian orthodox old testament  cf encyclopaedia judaica vol 6 p 1147 a large part of this literature consisted of the apocalypses based on prophecies these apocalyptic books were not considered scripture by all but rather part of a literary form that flourished from 200 bce to ce 100
during the  some of the jewish apocrypha that dealt with the coming of the messianic kingdom became popular in the rising  communities occasionally these writings were changed or added to but on the whole it was found sufficient to reinterpret them as conforming to a  christianity eventually gave birth to new apocalyptic works some of which were derived from traditional jewish sources some of the jewish apocrypha were part of the ordinary religious literature of the  this was strange as the large majority of old testament erences in the new testament are taken from the greek  which is the source of the deuterocanonical books literally means books of the second canon the term was coined in the 16th century  as well as most of the other biblical apocryphathe style manual for the society of biblical literature recommends the use of the term deuterocanonical literature instead of apocrypha in academic writing although not all apocryphal books are properly deuterocanonical 
slightly varying collections of additional books called deuterocanonical by the roman catholic church form part of the   and  canons see 
the  is included in the biblical canon only of the  churches of ethiopia and eritrea  the  quotes the book of enoch and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and clontz te and j the comprehensive new testament cornerstone publications 2008 isbn 978 0 9778737 1 5 http  wwwaccordancebiblecom comprehensive crosserences the genuineness and inspiration of enoch were believed in by the writer of the    and  and much of the early church the epistles of paul and the gospels also show influences from the  which is part of the ethiopian canon as well as the  and the  which are included in no biblical canon
the high position which some apocryphal books occupied in the first two centuries was undermined by a variety of influences in the christian church all claims to the possession of a secret tradition as held by many  sects were denied by the influential theologians like  and  which modern historians er to as the  the timeframe of true inspiration was limited to the apostolic age and universal acceptance by the church was required as proof of apostolic authorship as these principles gained currency books deemed apocryphal tended to become regarded as spurious and heretical writings though books now considered deuterocanonical have been used in liturgy and theology from the first century to the present
 
the actual status of the books which the catholic church terms deuterocanonicals second canon and protestantism ers to as apocrypha has been an issue of disagreement which preceded the reformation many believe that the pre christian era jewish translation into greek of holy scriptures known as the    a greek translation of the hebrew scriptures originally compiled around 280 bc originally included the apocryphal writings in dispute with little distinction made between them and the rest of the   others argue that the septuagint of the first century did not contain these books but were added later by christians name wegner    the earliest extant manuscripts of the septuagint are from the fourth century and suffer greatly from a lack of uniformity as regards containing apocryphal books    and some also contain books classed as  from which texts were cited by some early writers in the second and later centuries as being scripture name mcdonald  
while a few scholars conclude that the jewish canon was the achievement of the hasmonean dynasty  it  is generally considered to not have been finalized until about 100 ad  or somewhat later at which time considerations of greek language and beginnings of christian acceptance of the septuagint weighed against some of the texts  some were not accepted by the jews as part of the  canon and the apocrypha is not part of the historical jewish canon
early church fathers as    and  spoke against the canonicity of much or all of the apocrypha name  name wegner   but the most weighty opposition was  the fourth century catholic scholar  who perred the hebrew canon whereas augustine and others perred the wider greek canon  with both having followers in the generations that followed the catholic encyclopedia states as regards the middle ages
in the latin church all through the  5th century to the 15th century we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals there is a current friendly to them another one distinctly unfavourable to their authority and sacredness while wavering between the two are a number of writers whose veneration for these books is tempered by some perplexity as to their exact standing and among those we note st thomas aquinas few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity the prevailing attitude of western medieval authors is substantially that of the greek fathers   
 
the wider christian canon accepted by augustine became the more established canon in the western church  after being promulgated for use in the easter letter of athanasius circa 372 ad though in the same letter he denied all apocryphal books as being scripture except for baruch while excluding esther  the synod of rome 382 ad but its  is generally considered to be a much later addition    and the local councils of carthage and hippo in north africa 391 and 393 ad nevertheless none of these constituted indisputable definitions and significant scholarly doubts and disagreements about the nature of the apocrypha continued for centuries and even into trent     which  provided the first infallible definition of the catholic canon in 1546   this canon came to see appropriately 1000 years of nearly uniform use by the majority even after the 11th century schism that separated the church into the branches known as the  and  churches
in the 16th century the protestant ormers challenged the canonicity of the books and partial books found in the surviving septuagint but not in the  in response to this challenge after the death of martin luther february 8 1546  the ecumenical  officially infallibly declared these books called deuterocanonical by catholics to be part of the canon in  april 1546 ad while the protestant reformers rejected the parts of the canon that were not part of the  they included the four new testament books luther held as  doubtful  canonicity along with the apocrypha in his non binding canon though most were separately included in his bible name mcdonald   as  they were in some editions of the kjv bible until 1947   protestantism theore established a 66 book canon with the 39 books based on the ancient hebrew canon along with the traditional 27 books of the new testament protestants also rejected the catholic term deuterocanonical for these writings perring to apply the term apocryphal which was already in use for other early and disputed writings as today but along with others reasons name wegner   various ormers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason the differences between canons can be seen under  and   
 
explaining the  churchs canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the  church in the interpretation of how it was done  those differences in matters of jurisdictional authority were contributing factors in the  around 1054 but the formation of the canon which trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century in not settled six centuries before the separation  in the eastern part of the church it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement but in the end it was accomplished  the canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become roman catholic and eastern orthodox alike  the east did already differ from the west in not considering every question of canon yet settled and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its old testament  it also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions but not all  thus there are today a few remaining differences of canon among orthodox and all orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the catholic canon the     the   the  the   and  are included in some copies of the septuagint  some of which are accepted as canonical by eastern orthodox and some other churches   protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either but see them having roughly the same status as the other apocrypha
 
new testament apocrypha—books similar to those in the  but almost universally rejected by catholics orthodox and protestants—include several gospels and lives of apostles some were written by early jewish christians see the  others of these were produced by  authors or members of other groups later defined as  many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries producing lively speculation about their importance in early  among religious scholars while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings for some no more than the title is known artists and theologians have drawn upon the new testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of  and  and details about the  the first explicit mention of the  is found in the  
before the fifth century the christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient e  these were all candidates for the new testament and included several books which were eventually accepted such as    and the  apocalypse  none of those accepted books can be considered apocryphal now since all christendom accepts them as canonical  of the uncanonized ones the early church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well  some christians in an extension of the meaning might also consider the non heretical books to be apocryphal along the manner of martin luther not canon but useful to read  this category includes books such as the  the  and  which are sometimes erred to as the

alfred william lawson march 24 1869 – november 29 1954 was a professional  player manager and league promoter from 1887 through 1916 and went on to play a pioneering role in the us aircraft industry publishing two early aviation trade journals  in 1904 he also wrote a novel born again clearly inspired by the popular utopian fantasy  by  an early harbinger of the metaphysical turn his career would take with the theory of lawsonomy he is frequently cited as the inventor of the  and was awarded several of the first air mail contracts which he ultimately could not fulfill he founded the lawson aircraft company in  wisconsin to build military training aircraft and later the  in  to build airlinershttp  wwwaviationhalloffamewisconsincom inductees lawsonhtm aviation hall of fame wisconsin – alfred w lawson   the crash of his ambitious  midnight liner  during its trial flight takeoff on may 8 1921 ended his best chance for commercial aviation success
he made one start for the  and two for the  during the 1890 season his minor league playing career lasted through 1895 he later managed in the minors from 1905 to 1907
in 1908 he started a new professional baseball league known as the  the league took the field in april but folded one month later owing to financial difficulties name dc 
an early advocate or rather evangelist of aviation in october 1908 mr lawson started the magazine fly to stimulate public interest and educate readers in the fundamentals of the new science of aviation it sold for 10 cents a copy from newsstands across the country  in 1910 moving to new york city he renamed the magazine aircraft and published it until 1914  the magazine chronicled the technical developments of the early aviation pioneers he was the first advocate for commercial air travel coining the term airline he also advocated for a strong american flying force lobbying congress in 1913 to expand its appropriations for army aircraft
in early 1913 he learned to fly the sloan deperdussin and the  monoplanes becoming an accomplished pilot later that year he bought a thomas flying boat and became the first air commuter regularly flying from his country house in seidlers beach nj to the foot of 75th street in nyc about 35 miles in 1917 utilizing the knowledge gained from 10 years advocating aviation he built his first airplane the lawson military tractor 1 mt 1 trainer and founded the lawson aircraft corporation the companys plant was sited at green bay wisconsin there he secured a contract and built the lawson mt 2 he also designed the steel fuselage lawson armored battler which never got beyond the drafting board given doubts within the army aviation community and the signing of the armistice
after the war in 1919 lawson started a project to build americas first airline he secured financial backing and in five months he had built and demonstrated in flight his biplane airliner the 18 passenger  he demonstrated its capabilities in a 2000 mile multi city tour from milwaukee to chicago toledo cleveland buffalo syracuse new york city washington dc collinsville dayton chicago and back to milwaukee creating a buzz of positive press   the publicity allowed him to secure an additional 1 million to build the 26 passenger  in late 1920 he secured government contracts for three airmail routes and to deliver 10 war planes but owing to the fall 1920 recession he could not secure the necessary 100000 in cash reserves called for in the contracts and had to decline them in 1926 he started his last airliner the 56 seat two tier lawson super airliner  the aircraft crashed on takeoff on its maiden flight
in this phase of his life he was considered one of the leading thinkers in the budding american commercial aviation community but his troubles with getting financial backing for his ideas led him to turn to economics philosophy and organization
in the 1920s he promoted health practices including  and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200 he also developed his own highly unusual theories of physics according to which such concepts as penetrability suction and pressure and zig zag and swirl were discoveries on par with s   he published numerous books on these concepts all set in a distinctive typography lawson repeatedly predicted the worldwide adoption of lawsonian principles by the year 2000
he later propounded his own philosophy lawsonomy and the  he also developed during the  the  economic theory of s according to which banks are the cause of all economic woes the oppressors of both capital and labour lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers his rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 1930s mainly in the upper midwest but by the late 1930s the crowds had dwindled
in 1943 he founded the  in  to spread his teachings and offer the degree of knowledgian but after various irs and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954 the year of lawsons death lawsons financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day and in later years he seems to have owned little property moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes in 1952 he was brought before a  investigative committee on allegations that his organization had bought war surplus machines and then sold them for a profit despite claiming  status his attempt to explain lawsonomy to the senators ended in mutual frustration and bafflementfads and fallacies in the name of science p 77  
a farm near  is the only remaining university facility although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as  the large sign formerly reading university of lawsonomy was a familiar landmark for motorists in the region for many years and was visible from  about 13 miles 21ampnbspkm north of the  state line on the east side of the highway although the sign still exists the of has now been replaced by the  of the lawsonomy website a storm in the spring of 2009 destroyed the sign although the supporting posts are still visible on the northbound side of interstate 94 a sign on the roof of the building nearest the freeway said study natural law until being shingled over in october 2014

abalone are marine snails their taxonomy puts them in the family haliotidae which contains only one genus  which once contained six subgenera these subgenera have become alternate representations of haliotis name worms   the number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 name dcmd  and 130 name cox  with over 230 species level taxa described the most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid with 18 additional subspecies name go 
the  of abalones have a low open spiral structure and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shells outer edge the thick inner layer of the shell is composed of  mother of pearl which in many species is highly  giving rise to a range of strong changeable colors which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects jewelry and as a source of colorful 
the flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food and is consumed raw or cooked in a variety of cultures
the shell of abalones is  rounded to oval shape and may be highly arched or very flattened the shell of the majority of species is ear shaped presenting a small flat  and two to three  the last whorl known as the  is  meaning that the shell resembles an ear giving rise to the common name ear shell  has a somewhat different shape as it is more elongated and distended the shell of haliotis cracherodii cracherodii is also unusual as it has an  form is  shows an  spire and has prickly ribs
a  cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus these holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column they make up what is known as the  which forms as the shell grows this series of 8 to 38 holes is near the anterior margin only a small number are generally open the older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form each species has a typical number of open holes between four and ten in the selenizone an abalone has no  the  of the shell is very wide and 
the exterior of the shell is striated and dull the color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may lect the animals diet name mtss   the iridescent  that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white to pink red and green red to deep blue green to purple
the animal shows  head lobes the side lobes are also fimbriated and  the rounded foot is very large the  has small median teeth and the lateral teeth are single and beam like there are about 70  with  hooks the first four very large the soft body is coiled around the  and its insertion instead of being on the columella is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell the s are symmetrical and both well developed name tryon 
these snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at  depths although some species such as  used to be common in the  abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size their  is high and increases with their size from 10000 to 11 million eggs at a time the  are  and pointed at one end and the anterior end is a rounded head name tryon1 
the e are  the adults are  and feed with their   on  perring red or brown algae sizes vary from   to  while  is the largest of the genus at  
abalones are  on hard substrata
by weight approximately one third of the animal is edible meat one third  is offal and one third  is shell
the haliotid family has a worldwide distribution along the coastal waters of every continent except the pacific coast of south america the  the  and   the majority of abalone species are found in cold waters such as off the coasts of new zealand south africa australia western north america and japan
the shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic  tiles stacked like bricks between the layers of tiles is a clingy protein substance when the abalone shell is struck the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow  around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as   the dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles 
abalones are subject to various diseases the  said in 2007 that  killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions abalone are also severe  as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound members of the  family of the  are known as pests of abalone 
the meat foot muscle of abalone is used for food and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of  for jewelry buttons buckles and inlay name colliers  abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world ranging from 75000 year old deposits at blombos cave in south africa to historic chinese abalone middens on californias northern channel islands on the channel islands where abalones were harvested by native americans for at least 12000 years the size of red abalone shells found in middens declines significantly after about 4000 years ago probably due to human predation worldwide abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries
farming of abalone began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in japan and china  since the mid 1990s there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption  overfishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed the principal abalone farming regions are china taiwan  japan and korea abalone is also farmed in australia canada chile france  iceland ireland mexico namibia new zealand south africa thailand and the united states 
abalones have long been a valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where a species is abundant the meat of this mollusc is considered a  in certain parts of  especially  france new zealand  and  especially in china vietnam japan and korea in chinese speaking regions abalone is commonly known as  and sometimes forms part of a chinese banquet in the same way as  or  abalone is considered a  and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations however the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy
abalone started to become popular after the  in 1915 name jo 
as abalone became more popular and less common the prices have adjusted accordingly in the 1920s a restaurant served portion of abalone about 4 ounces would cost in inflation adjusted dollars about 7 by 2004 the price had risen to 75 name jo  in america prior to this time abalone was predominantly eaten gathered and prepared by chinese immigrants  by 1900 laws were passed in california to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone this forced the chinese out of the market and the japanese perfected diving with or without gear to enter the market by the time of the exposition americans were starting to discover abalone the popularity of abalone along with many other fish and shellfish increased as the exposition exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations and a 1300 seat dining hall

 has had an active abalone fishery since the late 1950s the state is sectioned into three fishing zones eastern central and western with each fisher required a zone allocated licence harvesting is performed by divers using surface supplied air hookah systems operating from runabout style outboard powered boats while the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds the deckhand operates the boat known as working live and stays above where the diver is working bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of shot line where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell since 2002 the victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011 12 fishing year due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus  which is fast spreading and lethal to abalone stocks
 
sport harvesting of  is permitted with a california fishing license and an abalone stamp card in 2008 the abalone card also came with a set of 24 tags this was reduced to 18 abalone per year in 2014 only nine of which may be taken south of  legal size abalone must be tagged immediately  abalone may only be taken using breath hold techniques or shorepicking scuba diving for abalone is strictly prohibited name referencea  taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the   a size minimum of  measured across the shell is in place  a person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time name cal15c

in new zealand abalone is called pāua  from the  haliotis iris or blackfoot pāua is the ubiquitous new zealand pāua the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue green and purple iridescence  and  are also found in new zealand waters but are less popular than h iris
like all new zealand shellfish recreational harvesting of pāua does not require a permit provided catch limits size restrictions and seasonal and local restrictions set by the  mpi are followed the legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver with a minimum shell length of  for h iris and  for h australis in addition no person may be in possession even on land of more than 20 pāua or more than  of pāua meat at any one time pāua can only be caught by free diving it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear
an extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat this can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under  customary rights when such permits to harvest are abused it is frequently difficult to police the limit is strictly enforced by roving  fishery officers with the backing of the new zealand police   is a major industry in new zealand with many thousands being taken illegally often undersized convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear boats and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases imprisonment the  expects in the year 2004 05 nearly 1000 tons of pāua will be poached with 75% of that being undersized 
 
the largest abalone in south africa  occurs along roughly two thirds of the country’s coastline abalone diving has been a recreational activity for many years but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting in south africa all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear
for the last few years however no permits have been issued for collecting abalone but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by  
in 2007 because of widespread  of abalone the south african government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the  section iii appendix which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species this listing was removed from cites in june 2010 by the south african government and south african abalone is no longer subject to cites trade controls export permits are still required however
the abalone meat from south africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching however much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in asian countries as of early 2008 the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately us4000 per kilogram there is an active trade in the shells which sell for more than us1400 per metric tonne
 
ormers  are considered a delicacy in the british  as well as in adjacent areas of  and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals this and a recent lethal bacterial diseasehttp  jerseyeveningpostcom island life history heritage ormers   has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century and ormering is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks the gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of ormering tides from january 1 to april 30 which occur on the full or new moon and two days following no ormers may be taken from the beach that are under  in shell length gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater any breach of these laws is a criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to £5000 or six months in prison  the demand for ormers is such that they led to the worlds first underwater arrest when mr kempthorne leigh of guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers

arminianism is based on  ideas of the  theologian  1560–1609 and his historic supporters known as the  his teachings held to the  of the reformation but they were distinct in some ways from particular teachings of    and other   jacobus arminius jakob harmenszoon was a student of  calvins successor at the theological university of geneva arminianism is known to some as a  diversification of   chambers biographical dictionary ed magnus magnusson chambers cambridge university press 1995 62   however to others arminianism is a reclamation of early church theological consensuskenneth d keathley the work of god salvation in a theology for the church ed daniel l akin nashville bamph academic 2007 703 
dutch arminianism was originally articulated in the remonstrance 1610 a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the  the  1618–19 was called by the states general to consider the  these articles asserted that 
# salvation and condemnation on the day of judgment was conditioned by the graciously enabled faith or unbelief of man
# the  is qualitatively adequate for all men yet that no one actually enjoys experiences this forgiveness of sins except the believer  and thus is limited to only those who trust in christ
# that man has not saving grace of himself nor of the energy of his free will and unaided by the  no person is able to respond to gods will
# the  of god is the beginning continuance and accomplishment of any good yet man may resist the holy spirit and
# believers are able to resist sin through grace and christ will keep them from falling but whether they are beyond the possibility of ultimately forsaking god or becoming devoid of grace  must be more particularly determined from the scriptures
these points note drs keith d stanglin and thomas h mccall are consistent with the views of arminius indeed some come verbatim from his declaration of sentiments those who signed this remonstrance and others who supported its theology have since been known as see jacob arminius theologian of grace new york oxford university press 2012 190 
many christian denominations have been influenced by arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration notably the  in the 16th centuryrobert g torbet a history of the baptists third edition  the  in the 18th century and the  in the 19th century  some falsely assert that  and  in the 18th and 19th centuries were theologically linked with arminianism denominations such as the  beginning in 1525  pre reformationthe waldensian way to god joseph visconti page 253 and following  and other groups prior to the reformation have also affirmed that each person may choose the contingent response of either resisting gods grace or yielding to it
the original beliefs of jacobus arminius himself are commonly defined as arminianism but more broadly the term may embrace the teachings of   and others as well  to which arminius is the main contributor and  to which john wesley is the main contributor are the two main schools of thought wesleyan arminianism is often identical with methodism some schools of thought notably —which teaches that the first step of salvation is by human willstanglin and mccall 160 —are confused as being arminian in nature but classical arminianism holds that the first step of salvation is solely the grace of godf leroy forlines classical arminianism a theology of salvation ed j matthew pinson nashville randall house publications 2011 20 24  historically the  condemned semi pelagian thought as well as supralapsarian calvinism and is accepted by some as a document which can be understood as teaching a doctrine between  thought and semi pelagian thought relegating arminianism to the orthodoxy of the early church fatherskeathley 703 
the two systems of calvinism and arminianism share both history and many doctrines and the   arminianism is related to  historically  however because of their differences over the doctrines of divine  and election many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other in short the difference can be seen ultimately by whether god allows his desire to save all to be resisted by an individuals will in the arminian doctrine or if gods grace is irresistible and limited to only some in calvinism put another way is gods sovereignty shown in part through his allowance of free decisions some calvinists assert that the arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of salvation and theore is not only by grace while arminians firmly reject this conclusion  many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine while others find them to be relatively minorgonzalez justo l the story of christianity vol two the reformation to the present day new york harpercollins publishers 1985 reprint – peabody prince press 2008 180 
jacobus arminius was a dutch pastor and theologian in the late 16th and early 17th centuries he was taught by   hand picked successor but after examination of the scriptures he rejected his teachers theology that it is god who unconditionally elects some for salvation instead arminius proposed that the election of god was of believers thereby making it  arminiuss views were challenged by the dutch calvinists especially  but arminius died before a national synod could occur
arminiuss followers not wanting to adopt their leaders name called themselves the  when arminius died before he could satisfy hollands state generals request for a 14 page paper outlining his views the remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the  after some political maneuvering the dutch calvinists were able to convince  to deal with the situation maurice systematically removed arminian magistrates from office and called a national synod at dordrecht this  was open primarily to dutch calvinists arminians were excluded with calvinist representatives from other countries and in 1618 published a condemnation of arminius and his followers as heretics part of this publication was the famous  in response to the five articles of remonstrance

the debate between calvins followers and arminiuss followers is distinctive of post reformation church history the emerging baptist movement in 17th century england for example was a microcosm of the historic debate between calvinists and arminians the first baptists–called  because of their confession of a general or unlimited atonement were arminiansgonzalez justo l the story of christianity vol 2 the reformation to the present day harpercollins publishers 1985 reprint – peabody prince press 2008 225–226  the baptist movement originated with thomas helwys who left his mentor john smyth who had moved into shared belief and other distinctives of the dutch waterlander mennonites of amsterdam and returned to london to start the first english baptist church in 1611 later general baptists such as john griffith samuel loveday and  defended a reformed arminian theology that lected more the arminianism of arminius than that of the later remonstrants or the english arminianism of arminian  like john goodwin or anglican arminians such as  and  the general baptists encapsulated their arminian views in numerous confessions the most influential of which was the standard confession of 1660 in the 1640s the particular baptists were formed diverging strongly from arminian doctrine and embracing the strong calvinism of the presbyterians and independents their robust calvinism was publicized in such confessions as the london baptist confession of 1644 and the second london confession of 1689 interestingly the london confession of 1689 was later used by calvinistic baptists in america called the philadelphia baptist confession whereas the standard confession of 1660 was used by the american heirs of the english general baptists who soon came to be known as

recent influence of the  movement has also reached arminianism — primarily through a view of corporate election the new perspective scholars propose that the 1st century  understood election primarily as national  and racial  not as individual their conclusion is thus that pauls writings on election should be interpreted in a similar corporate light
arminian theology usually falls into one of two groups — classical arminianism drawn from the teaching of jacobus arminius — and wesleyan arminian drawing primarily from wesley both groups overlap substantially
classical arminianism sometimes titled reformed arminianism or reformation arminianism is the theological system that was presented by  and maintained by some of the ashby stephen reformed arminianism four views on eternal security grand rapids zondervan 2002 137  its influence serves as the foundation for all arminian systems a list of beliefs is given below

jesuss death  gods justice the penalty for the sins of the elect is paid in full through jesuss work on the cross thus christs atonement is intended for all but requires faith to be effected arminius states that justification when used for the act of a judge is either purely the imputation of righteousness through mercy… or that man is justified before god… according to the rigor of justice without any forgivenessarminius iii454  stephen ashby clarifies arminius allowed for only two possible ways in which the sinner might be justified 1 by our absolute and perfect adherence to the law or 2 purely by gods imputation of christs righteousnessashby four views 140 
grace is resistible god takes initiative in the salvation process and his grace comes to all people this grace often called  or pre regenerating grace acts on all people to convince them of the gospel draw them strongly towards salvation and enable the possibility of sincere faith picirilli states that indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resistedpicirilli robert grace faith free will contrasting views of salvation calvinism and arminianism nashville randall house publications 2002 154ff  the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause effect deterministic method but rather in an influence and response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely deniedforlines leroy f pinson matthew j and ashby stephen m the quest for truth answering lifes inescapable questions nashville randall house publications 2001 313–321

on whether a believer could commit apostasy ie desert christ by cleaving again to this evil world losing a good conscience or by failing to hold on to sound doctrine arminius declared that this matter required further study in the scriptures name works of arminius 2219 220works of arminius 2219 220  nevertheless arminius believed the scriptures taught that believers are graciously empowered by christ and the holy spirit to fight against satan sin the world and their own flesh and to gain the victory over these enemies name works of arminius 2219 220  furthermore christ and the spirit are ever present to aid and assist believers through various temptations but this security was not unconditional but conditional—provided they believers stand prepared for the battle implore his help and be not wanting to themselves christ preserves them from fallingworks of arminius 2219 220 this seems to fit with arminius’ other statements on the need for perseverance in faith for example god resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe and to save in christ on account of christ and through christ those who persevere in faith but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers and to condemn them as aliens from christ works of arminius 2465 cf 2466 in another place he writes god wills that they who believe and persevere in faith shall be saved but that those who are unbelieving and impenitent shall remain under condemnation works of arminius 3412 cf 3413  arminius goes on to say i never taught that a true believer can either totally or finally fall away from the faith and perish yet i will not conceal that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect and those answers to them which i have been permitted to see are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understandingworks of arminius 2219 220 william nichols notes arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last conference which he had with gomarus a calvinist before the states of holland on the 12th of aug 1609 only two months prior to his decease works of arminius 1665 bj oropeza says although arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his declaration of sentiments in the examination of the treatise of perkins on the order and mode of predestination he writes that a person who is being built into the church of christ may resist the continuation of this process concerning the believers it may suffice to encourage them if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock unless they of their own will forsake their position works of arminius 3455 cf 1667 a believing member of christ may become slothful give place to sin and gradually die altogether ceasing to be a member works of arminius 3458 the covenant of god jeremiah 23 does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from god but a promise of the gift of fear whereby they shall be hindered from going away from god so long as that shall flourish in their hearts if there is any consistency in arminius position he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away paul and apostasy 16 
after the death of arminius in 1609 the remonstrants maintained their leaders view on conditional security and his uncertainty regarding the possibility of believers committing apostasy this is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610the article reads that those who are incorporated into christ by a true faith and have thereby become partakers of his life giving spirit have thereby full power to strive against satan sin the world and their own flesh and to win the victory it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the holy ghost and that jesus christ assists them through his spirit in all temptations extends to them his hand and if only they are ready for the conflict and desire his help and are not inactive keeps them from falling so that they by not craft or power of satan can be misled nor plucked out of christs hand according to the word of christ john 1028 neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand  but whether they are capable through negligence of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in christ of again returning to this present evil world of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them of losing a good conscience of becoming devoid of grace that must be more particularly determined out of the holy scripture before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds philip schaff editor the creeds of christendom volume iii the evangelical protestant creeds the articles of the remonstrants 3548 549  however sometime between 1610 and the official proceeding of the synod of dort 1618 the  became fully persuaded in their minds that the scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever they formalized their views in the opinion of the remonstrants 1618points three and four in the fifth article read true believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith not only is it possible for this to happen but it even happens frequently true believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds to persevere and to die in them and theore finally to fall and to perish peter y dejong crisis in the reformed churches essays in commemoration of the great synod of dordt 1618 1619 220ff for more on the remonstrant view regarding apostasy see the external link articles the opinions of the remonstrants 1618 and the arminian confession of 1621 and apostasy

the core beliefs of jacobus arminius and the remonstrants are summarized as such by theologian stephen ashby
#prior to being drawn and enabled one is unable to believe… able only to resist
#having been drawn and enabled but prior to regeneration one is able to believe… able also to resist
#after one believes god then regenerates one is able to continue believing… able also to resist

john wesley has historically been the most influential advocate for the teachings of arminian soteriology wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what arminius himself taught maintaining strong doctrines of original sin total depravity conditional election prevenient grace unlimited atonement and possibly apostasy
wesley departs from classical arminianism primarily on three issues
 atonement
 wesleys atonement is a hybrid of the  theory and the  theory of  a lawyer and one of the remonstrants steven harper states wesley does not place the substitionary element primarily within a legal frameworkrather his doctrine seeks to bring into proper relationship the justice between gods love for persons and gods hatred of sinit is not the satisfaction of a legal demand for justice so much as it is an act of mediated reconciliationharper steven wesleyan arminianism four views on eternal security grand rapids zondervan 2002 227ff 
 possibility of apostasy
 wesley fully accepted the arminian view that genuine christians could apostatize and lose their salvation as his famous sermon a call to backsliders clearly demonstrates harper summarizes as follows the act of committing sin is not in itself ground for the loss of salvationthe loss of salvation is much more related to experiences that are profound and prolonged wesley sees two primary pathways that could result in a permanent fall from grace unconfessed sin and the actual expression of apostasyharper 239–240  wesley disagrees with arminius however in maintaining that such apostasy was not final when talking about those who have made shipwreck of their faith 1 tim 119 wesley claims that not one or a hundred only but i am persuaded several thousandsinnumerable are the instancesof those who had fallen but now stand uprightwesley john a call to backsliders in the works of john wesley ed thomas jackson 14 vols london wesley methodist book room 1872 repr grand rapids baker 1986 3211ff 
 
 according to wesleys teaching christians could attain a state of practical perfection meaning a lack of all voluntary sin by the empowerment of the holy spirit in this life christian perfection or entire sanctification according to wesley is purity of intention dedicating all the life to god and the mind which was in christ enabling us to walk as christ walked it is loving god with all our heart and our neighbor as ourselves name xqpwlwwesley john a plain account of christian perfection works  it is a restoration not only to the favour but likewise to the image of god our being filled with the fullness of godwesley john the end of christ’s coming works  wesley was clear that christian perfection did not imply perfection of bodily health or an infallibility of judgment it also does not mean we no longer violate the will of god for involuntary transgressions remain perfected christians remain subject to temptation and have continued need to pray for forgiveness and holiness it is not an absolute perfection but a perfection in love furthermore wesley did not teach a salvation by perfection but rather says that even perfect holiness is acceptable to god only through jesus christ name xqpwlw 
since the time of arminius his name has come to represent a very large variety of beliefs some of these beliefs such as pelagianism and semi pelagianism see  are not considered to be within arminian orthodoxy and are dealt with elsewhere some doctrines however do adhere to the arminian foundation and while minority views are highlighted below
 
the doctrine of open theism states that god is omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient but differs on the nature of the future open theists claim that the future is not completely determined or settled because people have not made their free decisions yet god theore knows the future partially in possibilities human free actions rather than solely certainties divinely determined events as such open theists resolve the issue of human  and gods sovereignty by claiming that god is sovereign because he does not ordain each human choice but rather works in cooperation with his creation to bring about his will this notion of sovereignty and freedom is foundational to their understanding of  since open theists believe that love is not genuine unless it is freely chosen the power of choice under this definition has the potential for as much harm as it does good and open theists see free will as the best answer to the  well known proponents of this theology are     and 
some arminians such as professor and theologian robert picirilli reject the doctrine of open theism as a deformed arminianismpicirilli grace faith free will 40 – picirilli actually objects so strongly to the link between arminianism and open theism that he devotes an entire section to his objections see 59ff  joseph dongell stated that open theism actually moves beyond classical arminianism towards dongell joseph and walls jerry why i am not a calvinist 45  there are also some arminians like roger olson who believe open theism to be an alternative view that a christian can have the majority arminian view accepts  – the belief that gods power knowledge and presence have no external limitations that is outside of his divine nature most arminians reconcile human free will with gods sovereignty and foreknowledge by holding three points
human free will is limited by original sin though gods  restores to humanity the ability to accept gods call of salvationpicirilli grace faith free will 42–43 59ff ashby four views on eternal security 146–147 
god purposely exercises his sovereignty in ways that do not illustrate its extent – in other words he has the power and authority to predetermine salvation but he chooses to apply it through different means
gods foreknowledge of the future is exhaustive and complete and theore the future is certain and not contingent on human action god does not determine the future but he does know it gods certainty and human contingency are compatiblepicirilli grace faith free will 40 
 
the majority arminian view is that election is individual and based on gods foreknowledge of faith but a second perspective deserves mention these arminians reject the concept of individual election entirely perring to understand the doctrine in corporate terms according to this corporate election god never chose individuals to elect to salvation but rather he chose to elect the believing church to salvation dutch reformed theologian herman ridderbos says the certainty of salvation does not rest on the fact that the church belongs to a certain number but that it belongs to christ from before the foundation of the world fixity does not lie in a hidden decree theore but in corporate unity of the church with christ whom it has come to know in the gospel and has learned to embrace in faithridderbos herman paul an outline of his theology trans john richard de witt grand rapids eerdmans 1975 350–351 
corporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the old testament and jewish law indeed most biblical scholarship is in agreement that judeo greco roman thought in the 1st century was opposite of the western worlds individual first mantra – it was very collectivist or communitarian in nature name abascianoabasciano brian paul’s use of the old testament in romans 91–9 an intertextual and theological exegesis tampt clark publishers 2006 isbn 0 567 03073 3  identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality name abasciano   according to romans 9–11 supporters claim jewish election as the chosen people ceased with their national rejection of jesus as messiah as a result of the new covenant gods chosen people are now the corporate body of christ the church sometimes called spiritual israel – see also  pastor and theologian dr brian abasciano claims what paul says about jews gentiles and christians whether of their place in god’s plan or their election or their salvation or how they should think or behave he says from a corporate perspective which views the group as primary and those he speaks about as embedded in the group these individuals act as members of the group to which they belong and what happens to them happens by virtue of their membership in the group name abasciano  
these scholars also maintain that jesus was the only human ever elected and that individuals must be in christ eph 13–4 through faith to be part of the elect this was in fact swiss reformed theologian s understanding of the doctrine of election joseph dongell professor at asbury theological seminary states the most conspicuous feature of ephesians 13–210 is the phrase in christ which occurs twelve times in ephesians 13–4 alonethis means that jesus christ himself is the chosen one the predestined one whenever one is incorporated into him by grace through faith one comes to share in jesus special status as chosen of goddongell joseph and walls jerry why i am not a calvinist 76  markus barth illustrates the inter connectedness election in christ must be understood as the election of gods people only as members of that community do individuals share in the benefits of gods gracious choicebarth markus ephesians garden city ny doubleday 1974 108

arminianism supports works based salvation – no well known system of arminianism denies salvation by faith alone and by faith first to last this misconception is often directed at the arminian possibility of apostasy which critics maintain requires continual good works to achieve final salvation to arminians however both initial salvation and eternal security are by faith alone hence by faith first to last belief through faith is the condition for entrance into the kingdom of god unbelief is the condition for exit from the kingdom of god – not a lack of good workspawson once saved always saved 121–124 picirilli grace faith free will 160ff ashby four views on eternal security 142ff

arminianism denies jesus substitutionary payment for sins – both arminius and wesley believed in the necessity and sufficiency of christs atonement through picirilli grace faith free will 104–105 132ff  arminius held that gods justice was satisfied ashby four views on eternal security 140ff  while hugo grotius and many of wesleys followers taught that it was satisfied picirilli grace faith free will 132 
ever since arminius and his followers revolted against calvinism in the early 17th century protestant soteriology has been largely divided between calvinism and arminianism the extreme of calvinism is  which insists that signs of election must be sought before evangelization of the unregenerate takes place and that the eternally damned have no obligation to repent and believe and on the extreme of arminianism is  which rejects the doctrine of original sin on grounds of moral accountability but the overwhelming majority of   pastors and theologians hold to one of these two systems or somewhere in between
 
  arminians agree with calvinists over the doctrine of  the differences come in the understanding of how god remedies this human depravity
  arminians also affirm with calvinists the substitutionary effect of christs  and that this effect is limited only to the elect classical arminians would agree with calvinists that this substitution was  for all of the elect while most wesleyan arminians would maintain that the substitution was  in nature
 
nature of election  arminians hold that election to eternal salvation has the  attached the calvinist doctrine of  states that salvation cannot be earned or achieved and is theore not conditional upon any human effort so faith is not a condition of salvation but the divinely apportioned means to it in other words arminians believe that they owe their election to their faith whereas calvinists believe that they owe their faith to their election
nature of grace  arminians believe that through  god restores free will concerning salvation to all humanity and each individual theore is able either to accept the gospel call through faith or resist it through unbelief calvinists hold that gods grace to enable salvation is given only to the elect and  leads to salvation
extent of the atonement  arminians along with four point calvinists or s hold to a universal drawing and  instead of the calvinist doctrine that the drawing and atonement is  to the elect only which many calvinists per to call http  wwwspurgeonorg sermons 0181htm spurgeon charles haddon  both sides with the exception of hyper calvinists believe the invitation of the gospel is universal and must be presented to everyone they can reach without any distinctionnicole roger http  wwwapuritansmindcom arminianism nicolerogeruniversalcalldefiniteatonementhtm covenant universal call and definite atonement  383 september 1995 
perseverance in faith  arminians believe that future salvation and eternal life is secured in christ and protected from all external forces but is  and can be lost through  traditional calvinists believe in the doctrine of the  which says that because god chose some unto salvation and actually paid for their particular sins he keeps them from apostasy and that those who do apostatize were never truly regenerated that is  or saved non traditional calvinists and other evangelicals advocate the similar but different doctrine of eternal security that teaches if a person was once saved his or her salvation can never be in jeopardy even if the person completely apostatizes

the alan parsons project were a british  band active between 1975 and 1990  consisting of  and  surrounded by a varying number of session musicians and some relatively consistent band members such as guitarist  bassist and vocalist  drummer  and vocalist 
behind the revolving line up and the regular sidemen the true core of the project was the duo of parsons and woolfson woolfson was a songwriter by profession but also a composer and pianist parsons was a successful producer and accomplished engineer almost all songs on the bands albums are credited to parsons woolfson
 met  in the  of  in the summer of 1974 parsons had already acted as assistant engineer on   and  had recently engineered s  and had produced several acts for emi records name the great rock discography  woolfson a songwriter and composer was working as a session pianist he had also composed material for a concept album idea based on the work of  
when parsons asked woolfson to become his manager he accepted and subsequently managed parsons career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes including       and  name the great rock discography  parsons commented at the time that he felt frustrated in having to accommodate the views of some of the musicians which he felt interfered with his production woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the  where directors such as  and  were the focal point of the films promotion rather than individual film stars if the film industry was becoming a directors medium woolfson felt the music business might well become a producers medium
recalling his earlier edgar allan poe material woolfson saw a way to combine his and parsons respective talents parsons would produce and engineer songs written by the two and the alan parsons project was born their first album  released by  including major contributions by all members of pilot and  and narration by orson welles was a success reaching the  in the us   name the great rock discography  the song  featured lead vocals by the actor  and according to the 2007 remastered album liner notes was the first rock song to use a   with alan parsons speaking  through it
 then signed the alan parsons project for further albums through the late 1970s and early 1980s the groups popularity continued to grow although they were always more popular in north america and  than in their home country never achieving a uk top 40 single or top 20 album the  i wouldnt want to be like you  damned if i do time woolfsons first lead vocal and  had a notable impact on the   became their last successful single in the united states it reached the top 15 on the american charts in 1984 after those successes however the group began to fade from view there were fewer hit singles and declining album sales 1987s  would be the projects final release though they planned to record an album called  next
although the studio version of freudiana was produced by parsons and featured the regular project backing musicians making it an unofficial project album it was primarily woolfsons idea to turn it into a musical this eventually led to a rift between the two artists while parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the projects music  gaudi and gambler were three musicals that included some project songs like eye in the sky time inside looking out and limelight the live music from gambler was only distributed at the performance site in  germany
in 1981  parsons woolfson and their  arista had been stalled in contract renegotiations when on march 5 the two submitted an all instrumental album tentatively titled the sicilian defence the name of an  in chess arguably to get out of their  aristas usal to release the album had two known effects the negotiations led to a renewed contract and the album was not released at that time
in interviews made before his 2009 death  woolfson said he planned to release one track from the sicilian album which in 2008 appeared as a bonus track on a cd re issue of the  album sometime later alan had changed his mind about the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming project box set called the complete albums collection in 2014 for the first time as a bonus disc 
parsons released titles under his name    and  while woolfson made s named  about s work on  and  continuing from the alan parsons projects first album about edgar allan poes literature
tales of mystery and imagination was first ed in 1987 for release on cd and included narration by  which had been recorded in 1975 but arrived too late to be included on the original album on the 2007 deluxe edition release it is revealed that parts of this tape were used for the 1976 griffith park planetarium launch of the original album the 1987 remix and various radio spots all of which were included as bonus material
most of the projects titles especially the early work share common traits likely influenced by s  on which parsons was the  in 1973 they were s and typically began with an  introduction which faded into the first song often had an instrumental piece in the middle of the second  side and concluded with a quiet melancholic or powerful song the opening instrumental was largely done away with by 1980 no later project album except  featured one although every album includes at least one instrumental somewhere in the running order the instrumental on that album sirius eventually became the best known or at least most frequently heard parsons instrumental it was used as entrance music by various american sports teams most notably by the  during their 1990s   it was also used as the entrance theme for  in pro wrestling of the mid 1980s in addition sirius has been played in a variety of tv shows and movies including the episode vanishing act of  and the 2009 film 
the group was notable for using several vocal performers instead of having a single lead vocalist lead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their vocal style to complement each song in later years woolfson sang lead on many of the groups hits including time eye in the sky and dont answer me however he did not sing any lead vocals on the bands first four albums and appeared as vocalist only sporadically thereafter  when the woolfson sung songs became significant hits the record company pressured parsons to use him more but parsons perred real singers which woolfson admitted he was not in addition to woolfson     and   made regular appearances name the great rock discography  other singers such as  s   s geoff barradale and s dean ford have recorded only once or twice with the project parsons himself only sang lead on one song  through a vocoder and can be heard singing backing vocals on a few others including to one in paradise both of those songs appeared on 
although the vocalists varied a small number of musicians worked with the alan parsons project regularly these core musicians contributed to the recognisable style of a project song in spite of the varied singer line up together with parsons and woolfson the project originally consisted of the group pilot with  guitar  bass and  drums name the great rock discography  pilots keyboardist  also contributed from pyramid onwards tosh was replaced by  of  bairnson played on all albums and paton stayed almost until the end  appeared as arranger of orchestra and often choirs on all albums except vulture culture when he was composing the  of s film  this score was partly in the project style recorded by most of the project regulars and produced and engineered by parsons powell also composed some material for the first two project albums from vulture culture onwards richard cottle played as a regular member on synthesizers and saxophone
except for one occasion the project never played live during its original incarnation this was because woolfson and parsons saw themselves mainly in the roles of writing and production and also because of the technical difficulties of reproducing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio in the 1990s things changed with the technology of s the one occasion where the band was introduced as the alan parsons project in a live performance was at  1990 at the time of the groups break up featuring all project regulars except woolfson who was present but behind the scenes while parsons stayed at the mixer except during the last song where he played acoustic guitar
since 1993 a new version of the band has toured with parsons performing live acoustic guitar keyboards and vocals with various line ups this latest incarnation was called alan parsons eventually renaming as the alan parsons live project the name distinct from the alan parsons project due to founder parsons break up with woolfson

in  the phrase almost all has a number of specialised uses which extend its intuitive meaning
almost all is sometimes used synonymously with all but except ly many formally a  set or all but a  formally a  set see 
a simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd which is based on the fact that all but one prime number are odd  the exception is the number 2 which is prime but not odd
when speaking about the  sometimes it means all reals but a set of  zero formally  in this sense almost all reals are not a member of the  even though the cantor set is 
more generally almost all is sometimes used in the sense of  in  or in the closely related sense of  in 
in  if pn is a property of  and if pn denotes the number of positive integers n less than n for which pn holds and if
pn n → 1 as n → ∞
see  then we say that pn holds for almost all positive integers n formally  and write
math\forall^\infty n pn math
for example the  states that the number of  less than or equal to n is asymptotically equal to n ln n theore the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1 ln n which tends to 0 thus almost all positive integers are  not prime however there are still an infinite number of primes

an aromatic hydrocarbon or arenedefinition iupac  http  goldbookiupacorg a00435html link  or sometimes aryl hydrocarbonhttp  disskibkise 2003 91 7349 549 2 thesispdf mechanisms of activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by maria backlund institute of environmental medicine karolinska institutet  is a  with s and delocalized s between carbon atoms forming rings the term aromatic was assigned before the physical mechanism determining  was discovered the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour the configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon  aromatic hydrocarbons can be monocyclic mah or polycyclic pah
some non benzene based compounds called heteroarenes which follow  for monocyclic rings when the number of its π electrons equals 4n+2 where n 0123 are also called aromatic compounds in these compounds at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the s   or  examples of non benzene compounds with aromatic properties are  a heterocyclic compound with a five membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom and  a heterocyclic compound with a six membered ring containing one nitrogen atomhttp  wwwencyclopediacom doc 1e1 aromatichtml highbeam encyclopedia aromatic compound 
 csub6 subhsub6 sub is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and it was the first one named as such the nature of its bonding was first recognized by  in the 19th century each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share one goes to the hydrogen atom and one each to the two neighbouring carbons this leaves one electron to share with one of the same two neighbouring carbon atoms thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon
the structure is alternatively illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself this depiction represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon carbon bonds all of  ~15 the equivalency is explained by s the electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat

arenes are reactants in many organic reactions
in aromatic substitution one  on the arene ring usually hydrogen is replaced by another substituent the two main types are  when the active reagent is an electrophile and  when the reagent is a nucleophile in  the active reagent is a radical an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of

an abbey from  abbatia from latin abbās  derived from  abba father  is a   or   or  abbeys usually fall under the authority of an  or an  who serves as the spiritual father or mother of the community
the term can also er to a former abbey for example 
the formation of  communities dates back to pre christian times as witnessed by the  the earliest known christian monasteries consisted of groups of huts built near the location of a famous  or other holy person as these communities of disciples grew they attracted people who desired to study the ascetics doctrine and imitate his or her way of life name birt 
in the earliest age of christian monasticism the ascetics were accustomed to living alone ascetics would typically live near a village church supporting themselves while also donating their excess food to the poor increasing religious fervor and persecution drove them farther and farther away from civilization into solitude the deserts of egypt hosted some of the cells or huts of these anchorites 
 who had retired to the egyptian  during the persecution of  ad 312 was the most celebrated among them for his austerity sanctity and reputed power as an exorcist his fame attracted followers and the deeper he withdrew into the wilderness the more numerous his disciples became they used to be separated from him and built their cells around that of their spiritual father thus arose the first monastic community consisting of anchorites living each in his own little dwelling united together under one superior anthony according to  inadvertently became the founder of a new mode of living in common  cites  church history iii p 316 clarks translation 
at tabennae on the nile in upper egypt st  laid the foundations for the coenobitical life by arranging everything in an organized manner he built several monasteries each containing about 1600 separate cells laid out in lines as an encampment where the monks slept and performed some of their manual tasks there were large halls for their common needs such as the church ectory kitchen infirmary and a guest house an enclosure protecting all these buildings gave the settlement the appearance of a walled village it was this monastery layout inaugurated by st pachomius which finally spread throughout palestine and came to be called the laurae meaning lanes or alleys in addition to these congregations of solitaries all living in huts apart there were caenobia monasteries wherein the inmates lived a common life none of them being permitted to retire to the cells of a laurae before they had therein undergone a lengthy period of training in time this form of common life superseded that of the older laurae name birt 
 who visited the egyptian monasteries about the close of the 4th century found among the 300 members of the coenobium of  under the  rule 15 tailors 7 smiths 4 carpenters 12 cameldrivers and 15 tanners each separate community had its own  or steward who was subject to a chief steward stationed at the head establishment all the produce of the monks labour was committed to him and by him shipped to  the money raised by the sale was expended in the purchase of stores for the support of the communities and what was over was devoted to charity twice in the year the superiors of the several  met at the chief monastery under the presidency of an  the chief of the fold from miandra a sheepfold and at the last meeting gave in reports of their administration for the year details concerning the coenobia in the vicinity of  are found in the writings of  the monks lived in separate huts kalbbia forming a religious hamlet on the mountain side they were subject to an abbot and observed a common rule

the necessity for defence from attacks for monastic houses tended to accumulate rich gifts economy of space and convenience of access from one part of the community to another by degrees dictated a more compact and orderly arrangement of the buildings of a monastic coenobium large piles of building were erected with strong outside walls capable of resisting the assaults of an enemy within which all the necessary edifices were ranged round one or more open courts usually surrounded with s the usual eastern arrangement is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the  
this monastery like the oriental monasteries generally is surrounded by a strong and lofty blank stone wall enclosing an area of between 3 and 4 acres 12000 and 16000 m² the longer side extends to a length of about  there is only one main entrance on the north side a defended by three separate iron doors near the entrance is a large tower m a constant feature in the monasteries of the levant there is a small  gate at l the  comprises two large open courts surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone the outer court which is much the larger contains the granaries and storehouses k and the kitchen h and other offices connected with the ectory g immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two storied guest house opening from a cloister c the inner court is surrounded by a cloister ee from which open the monks cells ii in the centre of this court stands the  or conventual church a square building with an apse of the cruciform domical byzantine type approached by a domed  in front of the church stands a marble fountain f covered by a dome supported on columns opening from the western side of the cloister but actually standing in the outer court is the ectory g a large cruciform building about  each way decorated within with frescoes of saints at the upper end is a semicircular recess recalling the triclinium of the lateran palace at rome in which is placed the seat of the hegumenos or abbot this apartment is chiefly used as a hall of meeting the oriental monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells
monasticism in the west owes its extension and development to  born ad 480 nursias rule diffused rapidly its parent foundation on  the first abbey 529 name eb  through the whole of  every country witnessed the erection of monasteries that exceeded anything that had yet be seen in spaciousness and splendour few great towns in italy were without their benedictine convent the covenants quickly rose in all the great centres of population in england france and spain many monasteries were founded between ad 520 and 700 before the  ad 1415 no fewer than 15070 abbeys had been established from this  alone no special plan was adopted or followed in the building of the first caenobia the monks simply copied the buildings familiar to them the roman house or villa whose plan throughout the extent of the roman empire was practically uniform the founders of monasteries had often merely to install a community in an already existing villa when they had to build the natural instinct was to copy old models if they fixed upon a site with existing buildings in good repair they simply adapted them to their requirements as st benedict did at monte cassino the spread of the monastic life gradually effected great changes in the model of the roman villa the various avocations followed by the monks required suitable buildings which were at first erected not upon any premeditated plan but just as the need for them arose these requirements however being practically the same in every country resulted in practically similar arrangements everywhere name birt  the buildings of a benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan modified where necessary to accommodate the arrangement to local circumstances
the plan of the great abbey of saint gall erected about ad 719 indicates the general arrangement of a monastery of the first class towards the early part of the 9th century according to  the general appearance of the convent is that of a town of isolated houses with streets running between them it was planned in compliance with the benedictine rule which enjoined that if possible the monastery should contain every necessity of life it should comprise a mill a  s and  houses so that the monks had no need to go outside
the general distribution of the buildings may be thus described the church with its cloister to the south occupies the centre of a quadrangular area about  square the buildings as in all great monasteries are distributed into groups the church forms the nucleus as the centre of the religious life of the community in closest connection with the church is the group of buildings appropriated to the monastic line and its daily requirements   the ectory for eating the dormitory for sleeping the common room for social intercourse the chapter house for religious and disciplinary conference these essential elements of monastic life are ranged about a cloister court surrounded by a covered arcade affording communication sheltered from the elements between the various buildings the infirmary for sick monks with the physicians house and physic garden lies to the east in the same group with the infirmary is the school for the novices the outer school with its headmasters house against the opposite wall of the church stands outside the convent enclosure in close proximity to the abbots house that he might have a constant eye over them the buildings devoted to hospitality are divided into three groups  one for the reception of distinguished guests another for monks visiting the monastery a third for poor travellers and pilgrims the first and third are placed to the right and left of the common entrance of the monastery   the hospitium for distinguished guests being placed on the north side of the church not far from the abbots house that for the poor on the south side next to the farm buildings the monks are lodged in a guest house built against the north wall of the church the group of buildings connected with the material wants of the establishment is placed to the south and west of the church and is distinctly separated from the monastic buildings the kitchen buttery and offices are reached by a passage from the west end of the ectory and are connected with the bakehouse and brewhouse which are placed still farther away the whole of the southern and western sides is devoted to workshops stables and farm buildings the buildings with some exceptions seem to have been of one story only and all but the church were probably erected of wood the whole includes thirty three separate blocks the church d is cruciform with a nave of nine bays and a semicircular apse at either extremity that to the west is surrounded by a semicircular colonnade leaving an open paradise e between it and the wall of the church the whole area is divided by screens into various chapels the high altar a stands immediately to the east of the transept or ritual choir the altar of  b in the eastern and that of  c in the western apse a cylindrical campanile stands detached from the church on either side of the western apse ff
the cloister court g on the south side of the nave of the church has on its east side the  or  h the common sitting room of the brethren warmed by flues beneath the floor on this side in later monasteries we invariably find the  it appears however from the inscriptions on the plan itself that the north walk of the cloisters served for the purposes of a chapter house and was fitted up with benches on the long sides above the calefactory is the  opening into the south transept of the church to enable the monks to attend the nocturnal services with readiness via the day stair which lead to a cloister first or a night stair which lead directly to the church name eb   a passage at the other end leads to the  i the southern side is occupied by the ectory k from the west end of which by a vestibule the kitchen l is reached this is separated from the main buildings of the monastery and is connected by a long passage with a building containing the bake house and brew house m and the sleeping rooms of the servants the upper story of the ectory is the vestiarium where the ordinary clothes of the brethren were kept on the western side of the cloister is another two story building n the cellar is below and the  and store room above between this building and the church opening by one door into the cloisters and by another to the outer part of the monastery area is the parlour for interviews with visitors from the external world o on the eastern side of the north transept is the  or writing room p1 with the library above
to the east of the church stands a group of buildings comprising two miniature conventual establishments each complete in itself each has a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings ie ectory dormitory etc and a church or chapel on one side placed back to back a detached building belonging to each contains a bath and a kitchen one of these diminutive convents is appropriated to the  or novices q the other to the sick monks as an  r
the residence of the physicians s stands contiguous to the infirmary and the physic garden t at the north east corner of the monastery besides other rooms it contains a drug store and a chamber for those who are dangerously ill the house for bloodletting and purging adjoins it on the west u
the outer school to the north of the convent area contains a large schoolroom divided across the middle by a screen or partition and surrounded by fourteen little rooms termed the dwellings of the scholars the head masters house w is opposite built against the side wall of the church the two  or guest houses for the entertainment of strangers of different degrees x1 x2 comprise a large common chamber or ectory in the centre surrounded by sleeping apartments each is provided with its own brewhouse and bakehouse and that for travelers of a superior order has a kitchen and storeroom with bedrooms for their servants and stables for their horses there is also an hospitium for strange monks abutting on the north wall of the church y
beyond the cloister at the extreme verge of the convent area to the south stands the factory z containing workshops for s saddlers or shoemakers sellarii cutlers and grinders  makers  curriers fullers  and s with their dwellings in the rear on this side we also find the farm buildings the large granary and threshing floor a mills c malthouse d facing the west are the stables e ox sheds f goatstables gl piggeries h sheep folds

every large monastery had depending upon it smaller foundations known as cells or  sometimes these foundations were no more than a single building serving as residence and farm offices while other examples were miniature monasteries for 5 or 10 monks the outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as villae or granges they were usually staffed by  sometimes under the supervision of a single monk

on the eastern side there are remains of the dormitory raised on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south transept the chapter house opens out of the same alley of the cloister the small cloister lay to the south east of the larger cloister and still farther to the east we have the remains of the infirmary with the table hall the ectory of those who were able to leave their chambers the abbots house formed a small courtyard at the west entrance close to the inner gateway
 
 the largest and richest benedictine establishment in the north of england was first founded in 1055
it exhibited the usual benedictine arrangements  the entrance was by a strong gateway to the north close to the entrance was a chapel where is now the church of st olaf in which the new comers paid their devotions immediately on their arrival near the gate to the south was the guest hall or hospitium the buildings are completely ruined but the walls of the nave and the cloisters are still visible on the grounds of yorkshire museum the precincts were surrounded by a strong fortified wall on three sides the river  being sufficient protection on the fourth side the stone walls still exist and are one of the best surviving examples of abbey walls which remain in the countryhttp  wwwyorkhistoryorguk node 117 stmarys abbey york history

reforms adopted at cluny resulted in many departures from precedent chief among which was a highly centralized form of government entirely foreign to benedictine tradition the orm quickly spread beyond the limits of the abbey of cluny partly by the founding of new houses and partly by the incorporation of those already existing by the twelfth century cluny was at the head of an order consisting of some 314 monasteries name alstonhttp  wwwnewadventorg cathen 04073ahtm alston george cyprian congregation of cluny the catholic encyclopedia vol 4 new york robert appleton company 1908 4 may 2014 
the abbey church of cluny was on a scale commensurate with the greatness of the congregation and was regarded as one of the wonders of the middle ages it was no less than 555 feet in length and was the largest church in christendom until the erection of st peters at rome it consisted of five naves a narthex or ante church and several towers commenced by st hugh the sixth abbot in 1089 it was finished and consecrated by pope innocent ii in 1131 32 the narthex being added in 1220 together with the conventual buildings it covered an area of twenty five acres at the suppression in 1790 it was bought by the town and almost entirely destroyed name alston

the annales school  is a group of historians associated with a style of  developed by french  in the 20th century to stress long term social history it is named after its scholarly journal  which remains the main source of scholarship along with many books and monographssee http  wwweditionsehessfr revues annales histoire sciences sociales numeros parus  for recent issues  the school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in france and numerous other countries especially regarding the use of  methods by historians emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of 
the school deals primarily with late medieval and early modern europe before the  with little interest in later topics it has dominated french social history and influenced historiography in europe and latin america prominent leaders include co founders  1878–1956  1866 1946 and  1886–1944  the second generation was led by  1902–1985 and included  1919–1996  1915–2012  1921–1984  1923–2009  1924–2014 and  1895–1988  institutionally it is based on the annales journal the sevpen publishing house the  fmsh and especially the 6th section of the  all based in paris  a third generation was led by  1929–  and includes jacques revelsince 1978 revel has taught at the ecole des hautes etudes en sciences sociales paris where he is directeur détudes full professor he served as president of the ecole from 1995 to 2004  and  1914–1984 who joined the group in 1978  the third generation stressed  or mentalités  the fourth generation of annales historians led by  1945–  clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach replaced by the  and  which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices
  
the main scholarly outlet has been the journal annales dhistoire economique et sociale annals of economic and social history founded in 1929 by lucien febvre and marc bloch which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices
braudel was editor of annales from 1956 to 1968 followed by the medievalist jacques le goff  however braudels informal successor as head of the school was le roy ladurie noting the political upheavals in europe and especially in france in 1968  argues that in france the virtual hegemony of braudelian history and the annales came to an end after 1968 and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply   multiple responses were attempted by the school scholars moved in multiple directions covering in disconnected fashion the social economic and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe by the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across france europe and the rest of the world influence indeed spread out from paris but few new ideas came in much emphasis was given to quantitative data seen as the key to unlocking all of social historyone of numerous spin off journals was histoire amp mesure 1986–  devoted to quantitative history   however the annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the us and britain which reshaped economic political and demographic researchgeorg g iggers historiography in the twentieth century from scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge 59–61   an attempt to require an annales written textbook for french schools was rejected by the governmenthunt 1986  by 1980  sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives  as  notes the success of the annales school especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces contained the seeds of its own downfall for there is no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social identified with the realjacques revel and lynn hunt microanalysis and the construction of the social in histories french constructions of the past ed by jacques revel and lynn hunt 1995 480   the annales school kept its infrastructure but lost its mentalitéson the decline of annales see hunt 1986 for a summary of the movement see burke french historical revolution 106–107 
the journal began in strasbourg as annales dhistoire économique et sociale it moved to paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939 it was successively renamed annales dhistoire sociale 1939–1942 1945 mélanges dhistoire sociale 1942–1944 annales economies sociétés civilisations 1946–1994 and annales histoire sciences sociales 1994–  name journal namesp burke the french historical revolution the annales school 1929–89 p 116 n 2 
in 1962 braudel and gaston berger used ford foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation the  fmsh which braudel directed from 1970 until his death in 1970 the 6th section and the annales relocated to the fmsh building  fmsh set up elaborate international networks to spread the annales gospel across europe and the world in 2013 it began publication of an english language edition with all the articles translated
the scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches the emphasis is on social history and very long term trends often using quantification and paying special attention to geographysee lucien febvre la terre et lévolution humaine 1922 translated as a geographical introduction to history london 1932  and to the intellectual world view of common people or mentality mentalité little attention is paid to political diplomatic or military history or to biographies of famous men  instead the annales focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social economic and cultural history statistics medical reports family studies and even psychoanalysis
the annales was founded and edited by  and  in 1929 while they were teaching at the  and later in paris these authors the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist quickly became associated with the distinctive annales approach which combined geography history and the sociological approaches of the  many members of which were their colleagues at strasbourg to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th century historians as spearheaded by historians whom febvre called les sorbonnistes instead they pioneered an approach to a study of long term historical structures la  over events and political transformationscolin jones olwen huftons poor richard cobbs people and the notions of the longue durée in french revolutionary historiography past amp present 2006 supplement volume 1 pp 178–203 http  musejhuedu journals past_and_present v2006 20061sjoneshtml in project muse   geography material culture and what later annalistes called mentalités or the psychology of the epoch are also characteristic areas of study the goal of the annales was to undo the work of the sorbonnistes to turn french historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic historyjh hexter fernand braudel and the monde braudellien  historians pp 61 
co founder  1886–1944 was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École normale supérieure and in germany serving as a professor at the university of strasbourg until he was called to the sorbonne in paris in 1936 as professor of economic history  blochs interests were  highly interdisciplinary influenced by the geography of  1845–1918jason hilkovitch amp max fulkerson paul vidal de la blache a biographical sketch at

 a leader of the school wrote that the history he taught
relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and neglecting surface disturbances to observe the long and medium term evolution of economy society and civilisationgeorges duby le dimanche de bouvines 1973 forward 
the annalistes especially  advocated a histoire totale or histoire tout court a complete study of a historic problem
bloch was shot by the  during the german occupation of france in world war ii for his active membership of the  and febvre carried on the annales approach in the 1940s and 1950s it was during this time that he mentored braudel who would become one of the best known exponents of this school braudels work came to define a second era of annales historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s especially for his work on the mediterranean region in the era of  
braudel developed the idea often associated with annalistes of different modes of historical time lhistoire quasi immobile the quasi motionless history of historical geography the history of social political and economic structures la  and the history of men and events in the context of their structures
while authors such as   and  continue to carry the annales banner today the annales approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in   and 
blochs les rois thaumaturges 1924translated as the royal touch monarchy and miracles in france and england 1990  looked at the long standing folk belief that the king could cure  by his   the kings of france and england indeed regularly practiced the ritual  bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner the book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies in this case france and england as well as long durations longue durée studies spanning several centuries even up to a thousand years downplaying short term events  blochs revolutionary charting of mentalities or mentalités resonated with scholars who were reading freud and proust in the 1960s  and  harmonized the concept of mentalité history with s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions a flood of mentalité studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s by the 1990s however mentalité history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation but still lacked a solid theoretical basis while not explicitly rejecting mentalité history younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches
fernand braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945 he obtained funding from the rockefeller foundation in new york and founded the 6th section of the ecole pratique des hautes etudes which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences  it became an independent degree granting institution in 1975 under the name  ehess  braudels followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow and often imperceptible effects of space climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past  the annales historians after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in france were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history they perred to stress inertia and the longue durée special attention was paid to geography climate and demography as long term factors they believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors especially the will of revolutionaries they rejected the marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions in turn the marxists called them conservativesolivia harris braudel historical time and the horror of discontinuity history workshop journal 2004 57 161–174 issn 1363 3554 fulltext  only ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist 
braudels first book la méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à lepoque de philippe ii 1949 the mediterranean and the mediterranean world in the age of philip ii was his most influential  this vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences employed effectively the technique of the longue durée and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals  it stressed geography but not mentalité it was widely admired but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs the book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the annales school
before annales french history supposedly happened in paris febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912 with his sweeping doctoral thesis on philippe ii et la  the geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the kings policies set in paris

there is considerable speculation as to why the  is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter as opposed to a more even mixture of matter and antimatter this  in the  is one of the great david tenenbaum david http  wwwnewswiscedu 21376 one step closer uw madison scientists help explain scarcity of anti matter university of wisconsin—madison news december 26 2012  the process by which this inequality between particles and antiparticles developed is called 
antimatter in the form of anti atoms is one of the most difficult materials to produce antimatter in the form of individual anti particles however is commonly produced by s and in some types of  the nuclei of  both helium 3 and helium 4 have been artificially produced with difficulty these are the most complex anti nuclei so far observed  
the idea of  appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned using the once popular  the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by  in the 1880s between the 1880s and the 1890s  proposed the existence of squirts  and sinks of the flow of  the squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter  pearsons theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into 
the term antimatter was first used by  in two rather whimsical letters to  in 1898  in which he coined the term he hypothesized s as well as whole antimatter solar systems and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other schusters ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal merely speculation and like the previous ideas differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed  
the modern theory of antimatter began in 1928 with a paper  by  dirac realised that his  of the  for electrons predicted the possibility of s these were discovered by  in 1932 and named s a  of positive electron although dirac did not himself use the term antimatter its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons antiprotons etc  a complete  of antimatter was envisaged by  in 1929

one way to denote an  is by adding a bar over the particles symbol for example the proton and antiproton are denoted as  and  respectively the same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components a proton is made up of  s so an antiproton must theore be formed from  s another convention is to distinguish particles by their  thus the electron and positron are denoted simply as  and  respectively however to prevent confusion the two conventions are never mixed
almost all matter observable from the earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter if antimatter dominated regions of space existed the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable 
antiparticles are created everywhere in the  where high energy particle collisions take place high energy s impacting  or any other matter in the  produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting s which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter they may similarly be produced in regions like the  of the  and other galaxies where very energetic celestial events occur principally the interaction of s with the  the presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two s produced every time s annihilate with nearby matter the  and  of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511ampnbsp of energy ie the  of an  multiplied by sup2 sup
recent observations by the s  may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center the observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of  binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars mostly on one side of the galactic center while the mechanism is not fully understood it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a   
antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far away galaxies due to  in the primordial time of the universe antimatter galaxies if they exist are expected to have the same chemistry and  as normal matter galaxies and their s would be observationally identical making them difficult to distinguish   is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for x ray and gamma ray signatures of annihilation events in  s 
positrons are produced naturally in βsup+ sup decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes for example  and in interactions of gamma quanta emitted by radioactive nuclei with matter  s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity βsup− sup decay many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by and contained in  in january 2011 research by the  discovered antimatter positrons originating above  clouds positrons are produced in gamma ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds   antiprotons have also been found to exist in the s around the earth by the   
antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature mean particle energy greater than the  threshold during the period of baryogenesis when the universe was extremely hot and dense matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated the presence of remaining matter and absence of detectable remaining antimatter  also called  is attributed to  a violation of the cp symmetry relating matter to antimatter the exact mechanism of this violation during baryogenesis remains a mystery
satellite experiments have found evidence of s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays this antimatter cannot all have been created in the big bang but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies  for instance electron positron pairs may be formed in s as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron positron pairs from the star surface  therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae  this weathering takes place as the cold magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non relativistically expanding ejecta a shock wave system forms in the impact the outer one propagates in the ejecta while a reverse shock propagates back towards the starserpico pasquale d astrophysical models for the origin of the positron excess astroparticle physics 39 2012 2 11  the former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle
preliminary results from the presently operating  ams 02 on board the  show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality and with energies that range from 10  to 250ampnbspgev in september 2014 new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at cern and published in physical review letters    a new measurement of positron fraction up to 500ampnbspgev was reported showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events around an energy of 275 ± 32 gev at higher energies up to 500ampnbspgev the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again the absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500ampnbspgev but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies which peak about 10 gev  these results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive  particles name physrevltrs413 
cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal matter counterparts protons they arrive at earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2ampnbspgev indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons which on average have only one sixth of the energy 
there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei such as  nuclei ie anti alpha particles in cosmic rays these are actively being searched for a prototype of the ams 02 designated ams 01 was flown into space aboard the  on  in june 1998 by not detecting any  at all the ams 01 established an upper limit of 11×10sup−6 sup for the antihelium to helium  ratio 
positrons were reported  in november 2008 to have been generated by  in larger numbers than by any previous synthetic process a  drove  through a millimeter radius  targets  which caused the incoming electrons to emit   that decayed into both matter and antimatter positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper thin targets however new simulations showed that short ultra intense lasers and millimeter thick gold are a far more effective source 
the existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by  s  and  for which they were awarded the 1959   an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark  the properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton shortly afterwards in 1956 the antineutron was discovered in proton–proton collisions at the   by  and colleagues 
in addition to antis anti nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created these are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms with bound positrons in place of electrons in 1965 a group of researchers led by  reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the proton synchrotron at   at roughly the same time observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of american physicists at the alternating gradient synchrotron at  
   should antihelium be folded into this section i havent checked to see whether theyd created antihelium nuclei or true antihelium atoms with bound positrons   
in 1995  announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the   concept during the  the experiment was performed using the  lear and was led by walter oelert and mario macrigabrielse gerald and hartmut kalinowsky the production and study of cold antihydrogen no spslc i 211 1996  fermilab soon confirmed the cern findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities the antihydrogen atoms created during ps210 and subsequent experiments at both cern and fermilab were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study to resolve this hurdle and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s namely  and  in 2005 athena disbanded and some of the former members along with others formed the  which is also based at cern the primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic cold antihydrogen better suited to study
in 1999 cern activated the  a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from  to  — still too hot to produce study effective antihydrogen but a huge leap forward in late 2002 the athena project announced that they had created the worlds first cold antihydrogen  the atrap project released similar results very shortly thereafter  the antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the antiproton decelerator passing them through a thin sheet of foil and finally capturing them in a penning–malmberg trap  the overall cooling process is workable but highly inefficient approximately 25 million antiprotons leave the antiproton decelerator and roughly 25000 make it to the penning–malmberg trap which is about  or 01% of the original amount
the antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped to cool them further they are mixed into an electron plasma the electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via  collisions eventually the electrons are removed by the application of short duration electric fields leaving the antiprotons with energies less than   while the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap a small cloud of positrons is captured from   in a surko style positron accumulator  this cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen this neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls where it annihilates some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion
most of the sought after high precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped that is held in place for a relatively long time while antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral the s of their component particles produce a  these magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields 
antihydrogen can be trapped in such a magnetic minimum minimum b trap in november 2010 the alpha collaboration announced that they had so trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms for about a sixth of a second 
  this was the first time that neutral antimatter had been trapped
on 26 april 2011 alpha announced that they had trapped 309 antihydrogen atoms some for as long as 1000 seconds about 17 minutes this was longer than neutral antimatter had ever been trapped before
  
alpha has used these trapped atoms to initiate research into the spectral properties of the antihydrogen 
the biggest limiting factor in the large scale production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons recent data released by cern states that when fully operational their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per minute  assuming a 100% conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen it would take 100 billion years to produce 1ampnbspgram or 1  of antihydrogen approximately  atoms of anti hydrogen
antihelium 3 nuclei  were first observed in the 1970s in proton–nucleus collision experiments at the institute for high energy physics by y prockoshkins group  protvino near moscow ussr 
and later created in nucleus–nucleus collision experiments  nucleus–nucleus collisions produce antinuclei through the coalescense of antiprotons and antineutrons created in these reactions in 2011 the  reported the observation of artificially created antihelium 4 nuclei anti alpha particles  from such collisions 
    
antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container antimatter in the form of s can be contained by a combination of  and  fields in a device called a  this device cannot however contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles for which s are used in particular such a trap may use the  moment  or  of the trapped particles at high  the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off resonant laser radiation using a  or  small particles can also be suspended with  using a highly focused laser beamblaum klaus mark g raizen and wolfgang quint an experimental test of the weak equivalence principle for antihydrogen at the future flair facility international journal of modern physics conference series vol 30 the authors 2014

isolated and stored anti matter could be used as a  for  or   as part of an  or other ry such as the  since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels an antimatter fueled spacecraft would have a higher  than a conventional spacecraft

not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products while electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons these are difficult to direct and use for thrust in reactions between protons and antiprotons their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged s the  decay almost immediately with a half life of 84  into high energy photons but the  decay more slowly with a half life of 26 nanoseconds and can be 
note that charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of s carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions and unstable charged s carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons positrons and neutrinos cf  the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2 3 of the energy of the muons meaning that from the original charged pions the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about  
   
for more regular earthly applications eg regular transport use in portable generators powering of cities  artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier despite its high energy density because the process of creating antimatter is extremely inefficient according to cern only one part in ten billion  of the energy invested in the production of antimatter particles can be subsequently retrieved 
antimatter production is currently very limited but has been growing at a nearly  since the observation of the first antiproton in 1955 by segrè and chamberlain  the current antimatter production rate is between 1 and 10 nanograms per year and this is expected to increase to between 3 and 30 nanograms per year by 2015 or 2020 with new superconducting linear accelerator facilities at cern and 
some researchers claim that with current technology it is possible to obtain antimatter for 25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters given current electricity generation costs
many experts however dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude they point out that in 2004 the annual production of antiprotons at  was several picograms at a cost of 20 million this means that to produce 1ampnbspgram of antimatter  would need to spend 100 quadrillion  dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years
antimatter production costs in mass production are almost linearly tied to electricity costs so economical pure antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found
storage is another problem as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume cf  s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap for these reasons to date only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap which corresponds to much less than a femtogram antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons  the drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons

casa batlló  is a renowned building located in the center of  and is one of ’s masterpieces a remodel of a previously built house it was redesigned in 1904 by gaudí and has been urbished several times after that gaudís assistants  josep canaleta and  also contributed to the renovation project the local name for the building is casa dels ossos house of bones as it has a l  organic quality
like everything gaudí designed it is only identifiable as  or  in the broadest sense the ground floor in particular has unusual tracery irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work there are few straight lines and much of the  is decorated with a colorful  made of broken ceramic tiles  the roof is ed and was likened to the back of a  or  a common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre terminating at the top in a turret and cross represents the lance of  patron saint of  gaudís home which has been plunged into the back of the dragon
the building that is now casa batlló  was built in 1877 by antoni gaudi commissioned by lluís sala sánchez  it was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the  traditional by the end of the 19th century  the building had a basement a ground floor four other floors and a garden in the back name workarthttp  wwwcasabatlloes en history casa batllo gaudi work art  
the house was bought by josep batlló in 1900 the design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the batlló family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location it is located in the middle of  which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area it was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves name workart 
in 1906 josep batlló still owned the home the batlló family was very well known in barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city mr josep batlló i casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city mr batlló married amalia godo belaunzaran from the family that founded the newspaper la vanguardia josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative both josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit gaudí josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the batlló family such as casa pía built by the josep vilaseca he chose the architect who had designed  because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan the family lived on the noble floor of casa batlló until the middle of the 1950shttp  wwwcasabatlloes en history batllo family  
in 1904 josep batlló hired gaudí to design his home at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house gaudí convinced josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year the building was completed and urbished in 1906 he completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the batlló family he expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors in the same year the barcelona city council selected the house as a candidate for that year’s best building award the award was given to another architect that year despite gaudí’s design
josep batlló died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940  after the death of the two parents the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954 in 1954 an insurance company named seguros iberia acquired casa batlló and set up offices there in 1970 the first urbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house in 1983 the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior façade was illuminated in the ceremony of 
in 1993 the current owners of casa batlló bought the home and continued urbishments throughout the whole building two years later in 1995 casa batlló began to hire out its facilities for different events more than 2500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions due to the buildings location and the beauty of the facilities being rented the rooms of casa batlló were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city
the local name for the building is casa dels ossos house of bones as it has a l  organic quality the building looks very remarkable ampmdash like everything gaudí designed only identifiable as  or  in the broadest sense the ground floor in particular is rather astonishing with tracery irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work
it seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely much of the  is decorated with a  made of broken ceramic tiles  that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues the roof is ed and was likened to the back of a  or  a common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre terminating at the top in a turret and cross represents the lance of  patron saint of  gaudís home which has been plunged into the back of the dragon
the loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces it was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas it is known for its simplicity of shapes and its mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls it contains a series of sixty  arches that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal  some people believe that the “ribcage” design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon’s spine that is represented in the roof
the noble floor is larger than seven hundred square meters it is the main floor of the building the noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes  on the noble floor there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well on the passeig de gracia side is mr batlló’s study a festejador and a secluded spot for courting couples decorated with a mushroom shaped fireplace the elaborate and animal like décor continues throughout the whole noble floor
in 2002 the house opened its doors to the public and people were allowed to visit the noble floor the building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the international year of gaudí casa batlló met with very much unanticipated success and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house two years later in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on casa batlló the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well in 2005 casa batlló became a http  wwwworldsiteguidescom europe spain barcelona casa batllo  
the roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design gaudí represents an animal’s spine by using tiles of different colors on one side the roof is decorated with four chimney stacks that are designed to prevent backdraughtshttp  wwwcasabatlloes en history the building  
the facade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated the lower ground floor with the main floor and two first floor galleries are contained in a structure of   sandstone with undulating lines the central part which reaches the last floor is a multicolored section with protruding balconies  the top of the building is a crown like a huge gable which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks this room is currently empty the top displays a  with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations
roof tiles
the roofs arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye legend has it that it was once possible to see the sagrada familia through this window  which was being built simultaneously the view of the  is now blocked from this vantage point by newer buildings  the tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster with the color grading from green on the right side where the head begins to deep blue and violet in the center to red and pink on the left side of the building
tower and bulb
one of the highlights of the facade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions it is a bulbous root like structure that evokes plant life there is a second bulb shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering the tower is decorated with monograms of jesus jhs maria m with the ducal crown and joseph jhp made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the facade these symbols show the deep religiosity of gaudi who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica   to choose the theme of the holy family
the bulb was broken when it was delivered perhaps during transportation although the manufacturer committed to re do the broken parts gaudí liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring 
central section
the central part of the facade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies reminiscent of s nymphéas with gentle ripples and lections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic  it is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with 330 rounds of polychrome pottery the discs were designed by gaudí and jujol between tests during their stay in majorca while working on the restoration of the cathedral of palma 
balcony
finally above the central part of the facade is a smaller balcony also iron with a different exterior aesthetic closer to a local type of lily  two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture 
main floor
the facade of the main floor made entirely in sandstone and is supported by two columns the design is complemented by joinery windows set with multicolored stained glass  in front of the large windows as if they were pillars that support the complex stone structure there are six fine columns that seem to simulate the bones of a limb with an apparent central articulation in fact this is a floral decoration the rounded shapes of the gaps and the lip like edges carved into the stone surrounding them create a semblance of a fully open mouth for which the casa batlló has been nicknamed the house of yawns the structure repeats on the first floor and in the design of two windows at the ends forming galleries but on the large central window there are two balconies as described above

the park güell   is a public park system composed of gardens and architectonic elements located on  in   carmel hill belongs to the mountain range of  — the  is located on the northern face park güell is located in  a neighborhood in the  of barcelona with urbanization in mind  assigned the design of the park to  a renowned architect and the face of  the park was built between 1900 and 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926 in 1984  declared the park a  under “” name gaudiunesco 
park güell is the lection of gaudí’s artistic plenitude which belongs to his  phase first decade of the 20th century during this period the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes he put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry to that the catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative ornamental creation starting from a sort of baroquism his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premisses in the design of park güell gaudí unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the  catalan 
güell and gaudí conceived this park situated within a natural park they imagined an organized grouping of high quality homes decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort finished off with an artistic touch they also envisioned a community strongly influenced by  since in the common elements of the park they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect theore there are noticeable concepts originating from political     especially in the entrance stairway where the  are represented   and from    the  originally designed to be a  the  elements are so important apparently güell and gaudís conception of the park was also inspired by the  of 
on the other hand many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex  that gaudí applied to the urban project such erences go from political vindication to  exaltation passing through   and  specifically many studies claim to see erences to  despite the deep religious beliefs of both gaudí and  these erences have not been proven in the  of the modern architect the multiplicity of symbols found in the park güell is as previously mentioned associated to political and religious signs with a touch of mystery according to the perences of that time for  and 
the park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site the idea of count  after whom the park was named it was inspired by the english  hence the original english name park in  the name is parc güell the site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees called muntanya pelada bare mountain it already included a large country house called larrard house or muntaner de dalt house and was next to a neighborhood of upper class houses called la salut the health the intention was to exploit the fresh air well away from smoky factories and beautiful views from the site with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses count eusebi güell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in larrard house ultimately only two houses were built neither designed by gaudí one was intended to be a show house but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale and as no buyers came forward gaudí at güells suggestion bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906 name zim  this house where gaudí lived from 1906 to 1926 was built by francesc berenguer in 1904 it contains original works by gaudí and several of his collaborators it is now the  casa museu gaudí since 1963 in 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest
it has since been converted into a municipal garden it can be reached by underground railway although the stations are at a distance from the park and at a much lower level below the hill by city buses or by commercial tourist buses from october 2013 the entrance to the park is free but there is an entrance fee to visit the monumental zone main entrance and the parts containing mosaics gaudís house la torre rosa — containing furniture that he designed — can be only visited for another entrance fee there is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both gaudís house and the  church
park güell is skillfully designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park the buildings flanking the entrance though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by gaudí one of these buildings houses a permanent exhibition of the  muhba focused on the building itself the park and the city https  wwwyoutubecom watchv fxegigoea5k  virtual tour of muhba park güell 
the focal point of the park is the main terrace surrounded by a long bench in the form of a  the curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves creating a more social atmosphere gaudí incorporated many motifs of  nationalism and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry into the park
roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by gaudí as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures this minimized the intrusion of the roads and gaudí designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape his structures echo natural forms with columns like tree trunks supporting branching  under the roadway and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his  so that the  shapes form perfect compression structures name workshttp  me wservermechengstrathacuk group2003 groupl inspirational%20people antoni%20gaudi_files antoni%20gaudihtm

casa milà   popularly known as la pedrera  meaning the the quarry is a  building in    it was the last civil work designed by  architect  built between the years 1906 and 1912
it was commissioned in 1906 by businessman pere milà i camps and his wife roser segimon i artells at the time it was controversial because of the undulating stone facade and twisting  balconies and windows designed by 
architecturally it is considered structurally innovative with a self supporting stone front and columns and floors free of load bearing walls  also innovative is the underground garage
in 1984 it was declared a  by  currently it is the headquarters of the  which manages the exhibitions activities and public visits at casa mila
casa milà was built for the married couple roser segimon and pere milà roser segimon was the wealthy widow of josep guardiola an indiano a term applied to the spaniards returning from the american colonies with tremendous wealth her second husband pere milà was a developer criticized for his flamboyant lifestyle residents of barcelona joked about his love of money and opulence wondering if he was not rather more interested in the widow’s guardiola  than in guardiola’s widow 
the father  was a  businessman with interests in  he owned the 
he came into politics using his family money especially with his marriage to  of  as a member of a  family bish and very rich
 disdained the  in  he passed his days in the  in barcelona in a fashionable building
batillo visited his father   a businessman in  together they built  he met  and told him that gaudis next work would be special for him and indeed the  is a fine example of gaudis work when he could be bothered to finish not like in barcelona where his church is still under construction
milà bought a house at the corner of passeig de gràcia and provence that had formerly been owned by josé antonio ferrer vidal on june 9 1905 gaudí was hired in september to design his new home and on february 2 of 1905 the project was presented to the city council and the work began it was decided to demolish the existing building rather than orming it as had been done in the case of the casa batlló the building was completed in december 1910 and in october 1911 the milà moved there finally on october 31 1912 they got from gaudí the final certificate to rent the other floors of the building

gaudí a catholic and a devotee of the  planned for the casa milà to be a spiritual symbol name   google224  overt religious elements include an excerpt from the  prayer on the cornice and planned statues of mary specifically  and two   and  name google224  name gaudiclub1906http  wwwgaudiclubcom ingles i_vida pedrerahtml la pedrera casa milà 1906 1910 gaudiclubcom 
the design by gaudí was not followed in some aspects the local government fined the owners for many infractions of s and ordered the demolition of aspects exceeding the height standard for the citygaudí a biography gijs van hensbergen harper collins page 214 216  the encyclopedia of twentieth century architecture states that the statuary was indeed  also noting gaudís devoutness and notes that the owner decided not to include it after  an outbreak of  in the city name google224  after the decision was made to exclude the statuary of mary and the archangels gaudí contemplated abandoning the project but was persuaded not to by a priest name gaudiclub1906 
in 1940 pere milà died and roser segimon sold the property in 1946 monumental peter shows the employer and the estate to joseph balañá ballvé pellisé and in partnership with family pío rubert laporta known for its department stores in the san antonio round the transaction resulted in 18 million pesetas for the building and formed the compañía inmobiliaria provence sa cips to administer it  name huertas  roser segimon continued to live on the main floor until her death in 1964 name cronologia 
the new property was divided the first floor of provence in the street five floors instead of the original two in 1953 they commissioned juan francisco barba corsini the construction of 13 apartments in the attic which until then had been the laundry increasingly used and had become an unsafe place filled with garbage barba corsini respect gaudís original volume and structure the logis freedom approach that gave the open space and no right angles the apartments were located on the outer side of the space leaving a corridor of the distribution curve of the arches that give central courtyard leaving the darker area between the two courtyards as dealer floor apartments were 2 or 3 pieces some with a loft living with a design and furniture typical of the early 1950s with materials such as brick ceramic wood and furniture design similar to that of   name corsini  as chair quarry among others the works were supposed installing a chimney inadequate next to gaudís
installations and activities mixed with the neighboring houses in the early 1960s led to considerable losses of gaudís work especially decorative elements in 1966 the home was installed northern insurance company after which he settled a controversial  that would remain until 1985 he also installed an academy offices or inoxcrom cement mills among others  name huertas  maintenance costs were very high and their owners as well as to give shape to more homes left the building causing age some loosening of stones in 1971 emergency repairs were made by joseph anton comas respectful to the original especially the painting of tweaking yards name patrimoni
hernàndez cros josep emili  ed catàleg del patrimoni arquitectònic històrico artístic de la ciutat de barcelòna barcelona ajuntament de barcelona 1987 
on july 24 1969 gaudís work received official recognition as a historico artistic  it was a first step to prevent further destruction casa milà was in poor condition in the early 1980s it had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate but it has been restored since and many of the original colors revived
in 1984 it was named a part of a  encompassing some of gaudís works  first the  tried to rent the main floor to install office for the 1992 olympic bid finally the day before  1986 caixa de catalunya  bought la pedrera for 900 million pesetas on february 19 1987 urgently needed work began on the restoration and cleaning of the façade the work was done by the architects joseph emilio hernández cross and rafael vila in 1990 as part of the   the renovated main floor of the milan exhibition  dedicated to modern architecture in the center of the eixample opened name huertas 
the building is 1323 msup2 sup per floor on a plot of 1620 msup2 sup gaudí began the first sketches in his workshop in the  where he conceived of this house as a constant curve both outside and inside incorporating multiple solutions of formal  and elements of a naturalistic nature
casa milà is the result of two buildings which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine levels basement ground floor mezzanine main or noble floor four upper floors and an attic the basement was intended to be the garage the main floor the residence of the milàs a flat of all 1323 msup2 sup and the rest distributed over 20 homes for rent the resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical 8 because of the different shape and size of the courtyards the attic housed the laundry and drying areas forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof
one of the most significant parts of the building is the roof crowned with skylights staircase exits fans and chimneys all of these elements constructed with timbrel coated with limestone broken marble or glass have a specific architectural function nevertheless they have become real sculptures integrated into the building
the building is a unique entity where the shape of the exterior continues to the interior the apartments feature ceilings with plaster reliefs of great dynamism handcrafted wooden doors windows and furniture and the design of the hydraulic pavement and different ornamental elements
the stairways were intended for services in that access to housing was by elevator except for the noble floor where gaudí added a staircase of a particular configuration
gaudí wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other theore there were only lifts on every second floor so people had to communicate with one another on different floors
regarding the structure casa milà is characterized by its self supporting stone facade meaning that it is free of the functions of a load bearing wall which connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor this construction system allows on one hand large openings in the facade which give light to the homes and on the other free structuring of the different levels so that all walls can be demolished without affecting the stability of the building this allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify without problems the interior layout of the homes  name any2002a 
 
the facade is composed of large blocks of  from the  to the first floor of the quarry  to the higher levels the blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model later raised to its location on just adjusted to align them in a continuous curvilinear texture to the pieces around them
viewed from the outside are three parts the main body of the six story blocks with winding stone floors both floors of a block back with a change of pace in waves similar to waves with a texture more smooth and white with small holes that seem  and finally the body of the roof name permanyer 
the original facade of gaudí gone some of the local bars downstairs in 1928 the tailor mosella opened the first store in la pedrera he works and eliminate the bars this did not concern anyone because in the middle of twentieth century twisted ironwork had little importance the ironwork was lost until a few years later when americans donated one of them to the  where it is on display
within restoration initiatives launched in 1987 the facade they rejoined him some pieces of stone that had fallen in order to respect the fidelity of the original material was obtained from the quarry villefranche even though it was no longer operable  name huertas 
 
the building has a completely original solution in solving the lobby to not being a closed and dark but also for its open and airy courtyards connection with that equally important in gaining a place of transit and directly visible to the user accessing the building there are two patios in the round side of the paseo de gracia and the elliptical street provence
patios
patios structurally are key as supporting loads of interior facades the floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of  in the courtyard elliptical beams and girders adopt a constructive solution traditional but cylindrical gaudí applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams stretched radial beams like the spokes of a bicycle they from a point outside of the beam to two points above and below the making functions of the central girder  and works in tension and compression simultaneously thus supported structure twelve feet in diameter with a piece of maximum beauty and considered the soul of the building with a clear resemblance to the gothic cryptsthe centerpiece was built in a shipyard and  assimilates to the wheel of  interpreting the intent of gaudí represent the helm of the ship of life
interior gates
access is protected by a massive gate  with a design attributed to  it was common for people and cars where access to the garage in the basement now a in 
the two halls are fully polychrome with  oil on plaster surface showing a repertoire  erences  and flowers
during construction there appeared a problem adapting to the basement garage of cars the new invention that thrilled the bourgeoisie the future neighbor felix anthony meadows owner of industrial linera requested a correction in access because its  could not access it gaudí agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so felix who was establishing sales and factory fontanella street in  could go to both places with your car from la pedrera  name huertas 
for the floors of casa milà gaudí used a model of  forms of square timbers with two colors and the  hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the batllo house but which had not been used and recovered gaudí the quarry the wax was designed in gray john bertrand under the supervision of gaudí touched up with their own fingers in the words of the manufacturer   name bayo20 
 
like in  gaudí shows the application of the  as a support structure for the roof a form which he already had used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of s cooperative known as lobrera mataronense in this case gaudí used the catalan technique of  imported from  in the fourteenth century
the attic where the laundry rooms were located was a clear room under a  roof supported by 270 s of different heights and spaced by about 80ampnbspcm the roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm giving the roof deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys the shape and location of the courtyards make bows higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands
the builder bayó explained its construction first the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered after  indicated the opening of each arc and bayó nailed a nail at each starting point of the arc at the top of the wall from these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the bow then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked the corresponding centering which was placed and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks gaudí wanted to add a longitudinal axis of bricks connecting all vaults at their keystones
 
the work of gaudí on the rooftop of la pedrera was a collective of his experience at  but with solutions that were clearly more innovativeampnbsp– this time creating shapes and volumes with more body more prominence and less polychromasia permanyer either 1996 or 2008
on the rooftop there are six skylights staircase exits four of which were covered with broken pottery and some that ended in a double cross typical of gaudí twenty eight chimneys in several groupings like were designed for  twisted so that the smoke came out better two half hidden vents whose function is to renew the air in the building crowning the walkway that goes around this dream castle four cupulins domes that discharged to the facade the staircases also house the water tanks some of these are snail shaped
the stepped roof of la pedrera called the garden of warriors by the poet  because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights has undergone a radical restoration removing chimneys added in interventions after gaudí television antennas and other elements that degraded the space the restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of  and broken  one of the chimneys was topped with glass piecesampnbsp– it was said that gaudí did that the day after the inauguration of the building taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party it was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century the repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from  with fragments of tiles this whole set is more colorful than the facade although here the creamy tones are dominant  name ruta 
 
gaudí as he had done in casa batlló designed furniture specifically for the main floor it was part of the concept artwork itself integral of  in which the architect assumes responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade as every detail of the decor design furniture and accessories such as lamps planters floors or ceilings
this was another point of friction with mrs milà she complained that there was no straight wall to place your steinway piano which roser segimon played often and quite well name   orchards  gaudís response was blunt so play the violin  name patrimoni 
the result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of gaudí as furniture due to climate change and the distribution of the main floor which made the owner when gaudí died some remain in private collections some spare parts like a curtain made of  4 m long by 196 m high you can see in the museum of catalan modernism a chair and desktop of pere milà and some other complementary element
regarding oak doors carved by dint of gouge bachelors casas and bard only became the floor of milà and the floor show because when the lady met milà in the price was decided that they would do more of this quality name bayo20

public impressions
the buildings unconventional style made it the subject of much criticism it was given the nickname la pedrera name huertas  casa milà appeared in many satirical magazines  presented it as a traditional easter cake by means of cartoons in  joaquim garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine  name huertas  homeowners in  became angry with milà and ceased to say hello to him arguing that the weird building by gaudí would lower the price of land in the area
administrative problems
casa milà caused some administrative problems too on december 1907 the  stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk not respecting the alignment of facades again on august 17 1908 more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by  the council called for a fine of 100000 s approximately 25% of the cost of work or for the demolition of the attic and roof the dispute was resolved a year and a half later december 28 of 1909 when the commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a strict compliance with the bylaws name cronologia 
contests
the owner introduced him to artistic buildings annual contest of  where this year chose two works  calle mallorca 264 and corsica with  the house guster who was a particular house of the architect james gustin and perez samanillo house designed by hervás and arizmendi although the most dramatic and clear favorite was the house milan the jury ruled stating that even be finished facades take much to make you fully completed finalized and perfect state of appreciation the winner in 1910 was samanillo perez now the equestrian circle
design disagreements
gaudís relations with roser segimon deteriorated during the construction and decoration of the house there were many disagreements between them one example was the monumental   del rosario which gaudí wanted as the front head in homage to the name of the owner roser segimon that the artist  carles mani i roig was to sculpt the statue was not made although the words marian ave gratia m full dominus tecum were indeed written at the top of the facade the continuing disagreements led gaudí to take mila to court for over his fees the lawsuit was won by gaudí in 1916 and he gave the 105000 pesetas he won in the case to charity stating that the principles mattered more than money milà was having to pay mortgage quarry  name huertas 
after gaudís death in 1926 roser segimon got rid of most of the furniture that gaudí had designed and covered over parts of gaudís designs with new decorations in the style of   when la pedrera was acquired by  and the restoration done in 1990 some of the original decorations reemerged  name permanyer

particle antiparticle pairs can  each other producing s since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite total charge is conserved for example the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons producing pairs of  a process exploited in 
antiparticles are produced naturally in  and in the interaction of s in the earths atmosphere
because charge is conserved it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge as in  when a proton positive charge is destroyed a neutron created and a positron positive charge antiparticle is also created and emitted or by creating a particle of the opposite charge the latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously as in s this is the inverse of the particle antiparticle annihilation process
although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles the neutron for example is made out of  the  from  and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact however other neutral particles are their own antiparticles such as s hypothetical s and some s
in 1932 soon after the prediction of s by   found that cosmic ray collisions produced these particles in a — a  in which moving s or positrons leave behind trails as they move through the gas the electric charge to mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud chamber track in a  positrons because of the direction that their paths curled were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction  positron paths in a cloud chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge to mass ratio but with opposite charge and theore opposite signed charge to mass ratios
the  and  were found by  and  in 1955 at the  since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments in recent years complete atoms of  have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons collected in electromagnetic trapshttp  newsnationalgeographiccom news 2010 11 101118 antimatter trapped engines bombs nature science cern  
solutions of the  contained negative energy quantum states as a result an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state even worse it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available to prevent this unphysical situation from happening dirac proposed that a sea of negative energy electrons fills the universe already occupying all of the lower energy states so that due to the  no other electron could fall into them sometimes however one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this  to become a positive energy particle but when lifted out it would leave behind a  in the sea that would act exactly like a positive energy electron with a reversed charge these he interpreted as negative energy electrons and attempted to identify them with s in his 1930 paper a theory of electrons and protons
  however these negative energy electrons turned out to be s and not s
this picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe—a problem of which dirac was aware dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea until  proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges dirac also predicted a reaction ampnbsp+ampnbspampnbsp→ampnbspampnbsp+ampnbsp where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons  and  proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast a year later in 1931 dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron a new particle of the same mass as the electron the discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory
however the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains also as we now know  also have antiparticles but since bosons do not obey the pauli exclusion principle only s do hole theory does not work for them a unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in  which solves both these problems
if a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles reactions such as ampnbsp+ampnbspampnbsp→ ampnbspampnbsp+ampnbsp the two photon annihilation of an electron positron pair are an example the single photon annihilation of an electron positron pair ampnbsp+ampnbspampnbsp→ampnbsp cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process however in the coulomb field of a nucleus the  is broken and single photon annihilation may occur
  the reverse reaction in free space without an atomic nucleus is also impossible for this reason in quantum field theory this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the  this opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may fluctuate into a two particle state and back these processes are important in the  and  of a quantum field theory it also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here which is a complicated example of 
s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the  c  p and  t operators if math p\sigma n \rangle  math denotes the quantum state of a particle n with momentum p spin j whose component in the z direction is σ then one has
mathcpt \  p\sigman \rangle\  \  1^{j \sigma}\  p \sigman^c \rangle  math
where nsupc sup denotes the charge conjugate state ie the antiparticle this behaviour under cpt is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same  of the  properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this if t is a good symmetry of the dynamics then
matht\  p\sigman\rangle \ \propto \   p \sigman\rangle  math
mathcp\  p\sigman\rangle \ \propto \   p\sigman^c\rangle  math
mathc\  p\sigman\rangle \ \propto \  p\sigman^c\rangle  math
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side in other words particle and antiparticle must have
the same mass m
the same spin state j
opposite s q and  q
this section draws upon the ideas language and notation of  of a 
one may try to quantize an electron  without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing
math\psi x \sum_{k}u_k xa_k e^{ iekt}\ math
where we use the symbol k to denote the quantum numbers p and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy ek and asubk sub denotes the corresponding annihilation operators of course since we are dealing with s we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti commutation relations however if one now writes down the 
mathh \sum_{k} ek a^\dagger_k a_k\ math
then one sees immediately that the expectation value of h need not be positive this is because ek can have any sign whatsoever and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0
so one has to introduce the charge conjugate antiparticle field with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations
mathb_{k\prime}   a^\dagger_k\ \mathrm{and}\ b^\dagger_{k\prime} a_k\ math
where k has the same p and opposite σ and sign of the energy then one can rewrite the field in the form
math\psix \sum_{k_+} u_k xa_k e^{ iekt}+\sum_{k_ } u_k xb^\dagger _k e^{ iekt}\ math
where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy the energy becomes
mathh \sum_{k_+} e_k a^\dagger _k a_k + \sum_{k_ }  ek b^\dagger_k b_k + e_0\ math
where esub0 sub is an infinite negative constant the  is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle ie matha_k  0\rangle 0 math and mathb_k  0\rangle 0 math then the energy of the vacuum is exactly esub0 sub since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum h is positive definite analysis of the properties of asubk sub and bsubk sub shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles this is the case of a 
this approach is due to   and  if one quantizes a real  then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator theore real scalar fields describe neutral bosons since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators which are related by conjugation such fields describe charged bosons
  feynman–stueckelberg interpretation and stückelberg–feynman interpretation redirect here  
by considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time  reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass m and spin j but opposite charges q this allowed him to rewrite  precisely in the form of diagrams  later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism and they are now called s each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time this technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today
since this picture was first developed by  and acquired its modern form in feynmans work it is called the feynman stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles to honor both scientists
as a consequence of this interpretation villata argued that the assumption of antimatter as cpt transformed matter would imply that the  is repulsivem villata http  iopscienceioporg 0295 5075 94 2 20001 cpt symmetry and antimatter gravity in general relativity 2011 epl europhysics letters 94 20001

in  the associative property
  is a property of some s in  associativity is a   for  in 
within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator the order in which the  are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the s is not changed that is rearranging the  in such an expression will not change its value consider the following equations
math2 + 3 + 4   2 + 3 + 4   9 \ math
math2 \times 3 \times 4   2 \times 3 \times 4   24  math
even though the parentheses were rearranged the values of the expressions were not altered since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any s it can be said that addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations
associativity is not to be confused with  which addresses whether 
associative operations are abundant in mathematics in fact many s such as  and  explicitly require their binary operations to be associative
however many important and interesting operations are non associative some examples include   and the   in contrast to the theoretical counterpart the addition of  in computer science is not associative and is an important source of rounding error
formally a  ∗ on a  s is called associative if it satisfies the associative law
x ∗ y ∗ z   x ∗ y ∗ z for all x y z in s
here ∗ is used to replace the symbol of the operation which may be any symbol and even the absence of symbol  as for 
xyz   xyz   xyz for all x y z in s
the associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus 
if a binary operation is associative repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless how valid pairs of parenthesis are inserted in the expression  this is called the generalized associative law for instance a product of four elements may be written in five possible ways
# abcd
# abcd
# abcd
# abcd
# abcd
if the product operation is associative the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result making the parenthesis unnecessary thus the product can be written unambiguously as
abcd
as the number of elements increases the  grows quickly but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation
some examples of associative operations include the following
 the  of the three strings codehello code code  code codeworld code can be computed by concatenating the first two strings giving codehello  code and appending the third string codeworld code or by joining the second and third string giving code world code and concatenating the first string codehello code with the result the two methods produce the same result string concatenation is associative but not commutative
 in   and  of s are associative ie
 math
\left
\begin{matrix}
x+y+z x+y+z x+y+z\quad
\\
x\yz xy\z x\y\z\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\ \ \
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }xyz\in\mathbb{r}
 math
because of associativity the grouping parentheses can be omitted without ambiguity
 addition and multiplication of s and s are associative addition of s is also associative but multiplication of octonions is non associative
 the  and  functions act associatively
 math
\left
\begin{matrix}
\operatorname{gcd}\operatorname{gcd}xyz 
\operatorname{gcd}x\operatorname{gcd}yz 
\operatorname{gcd}xyz\ \quad
\\
\operatorname{lcm}\operatorname{lcm}xyz 
\operatorname{lcm}x\operatorname{lcm}yz 
\operatorname{lcm}xyz\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{ for all }xyz\in\mathbb{z}
 math
 taking the  or the  of 
 math
\left
\begin{matrix}
a\cap b\cap c a\capb\cap c a\cap b\cap c\quad
\\
a\cup b\cup c a\cupb\cup c a\cup b\cup c\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{for all sets }abc
 math
 if m is some set and s denotes the set of all functions from m to m then the operation of  on s is associative
 mathf\circ g\circ h f\circg\circ h f\circ g\circ h\qquad\mbox{for all }fgh\in s math
 slightly more generally given four sets m n p and q with h m to n g n to p and f p to q then
 mathf\circ g\circ h f\circg\circ h f\circ g\circ h math
 as before in short composition of maps is always associative
 consider a set with three elements a b and c the following operation
{  class wikitable style text aligncenter
  
 ×  a  b  c
  
 a
  a    a    a
  
 b
  a    b    c
  
 c
  a    a    a
  
 }
is associative thus for example abc abc   a this operation is not commutative
 because  represent  functions with  representing functional composition one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative
in standard truth functional propositional logic associationmoore and parker copi and cohen  or associativityhurley  are two   the rules allow one to move parentheses in  in  the rules are
mathp \or q \or r \leftrightarrow p \or q \or r math
and
mathp \and q \and r \leftrightarrow p \and q \and r math
where math\leftrightarrow math is a al  representing can be replaced in a  with
associativity is a property of some s of truth functional  the following s demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives the following are truth functional 
associativity of disjunction
mathp \or q \or r \leftrightarrow p \or q \or r math
mathp \or q \or r \leftrightarrow p \or q \or r math
associativity of conjunction
mathp \and q \and r \leftrightarrow p \and q \and r math
mathp \and q \and r \leftrightarrow p \and q \and r math
associativity of equivalence
mathp \leftrightarrow q \leftrightarrow r \leftrightarrow p \leftrightarrow q \leftrightarrow r math
mathp \leftrightarrow q \leftrightarrow r \leftrightarrow p \leftrightarrow q \leftrightarrow r math
a binary operation math math on a set s that does not satisfy the associative law is called non associative symbolically
mathxyz\ne xyz\qquad\mbox{for some }xyz\in s math
for such an operation the order of evaluation does matter for example
 
math
5 3 2 \ \ne \ 5 3 2
 math
 
math
4 2 2 \ \ne \ 4 2 2
 math
 
math
2^{1^2} \ \ne \ 2^1^2
 math
also note that infinite sums are not generally associative for example
math
1 1+1 1+1 1+1 1+1 1+1 1+\dots \   \ 0
 math
whereas
math
1+ 1+1+ 1+1+ 1+1+ 1+1+ 1+1+ 1+\dots \   \ 1
 math
the study of non associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra one area within  that has grown very large is that of s there the associative law is replaced by the  lie algebras abstract the essential nature of s and have become ubiquitous in mathematics
there are other specific types of non associative structures that have been studied in depth these tend to come from some specific applications or areas such as  other examples are     and 
in mathematics addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative  by contrast in computer science the addition and multiplication of  numbers is not associative as rounding errors are introduced when dissimilar sized values are joined togetherknuth donald  volume 3 section 422 
to illustrate this consider a floating point representation with a 4 bit mantissa
br1000sub2 sub×2sup0 sup +
1000sub2 sub×2sup0 sup +
1000sub2 sub×2sup4 sup  
1000sub2 sub×2sup1 sup +
1000sub2 sub×2sup4 sup  
100sub2 sub×2sup4 sup
br1000sub2 sub×2sup0 sup +
1000sub2 sub×2sup0 sup +
1000sub2 sub×2sup4 sup  
1000sub2 sub×2sup0 sup +
100sub2 sub×2sup4 sup  
100sub2 sub×2sup4 sup
even though most computers compute with a 24 or 53 bits of mantissa  this is an important source of rounding error and approaches such as the  are ways to minimise the errors it can be especially problematic in parallel computing 
 
in general parentheses must be used to indicate the  if a non associative operation appears more than once in an expression however s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non associative operations this is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses
a left associative operation is a non associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right ie
math
\left
\begin{matrix}
xyz xyz\qquad\qquad\quad\
\\
wxyz wxyz\quad
\\
\mbox{etc}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }wxyz\in s
 math
while a right associative operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left
math
\left
\begin{matrix}
xyz xyz\qquad\qquad\quad\
\\
wxyz wxyz\quad
\\
\mbox{etc}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }wxyz\in s
 math
both left associative and right associative operations occur left associative operations include the following
subtraction and division of real numbers
mathx y z x y z\qquad\mbox{for all }xyz\in\mathbb{r} math
mathx y z x y z\qquad\qquad\quad\mbox{for all }xyz\in\mathbb{r}\mbox{ with }y\ne0z\ne0 math
function application
mathf \ x \ y   f \ x \ y math
this notation can be motivated by the  isomorphism
right associative operations include the following
 of real numbers
mathx^{y^z} x^{y^z}\ math
the reason exponentiation is right associative is that a repeated left associative exponentiation operation would be less useful multiple appearances could and would be rewritten with multiplication
mathx^y^z x^{yz}\ math
 via the  operator
math a \uparrow \uparrow b   \ ^{b}a math 
math\mathbb{z} \rarr \mathbb{z} \rarr \mathbb{z}   \mathbb{z} \rarr \mathbb{z} \rarr \mathbb{z} math
mathx \mapsto y \mapsto x   y   x \mapsto y \mapsto x   y math
using right associative notation for these operations can be motivated by the  and by the  isomorphism
non associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following
taking the  of three vectors
math\vec a \times \vec b \times \vec c \neq \vec a \times \vec b  \times \vec c \qquad \mbox{ for some } \vec a\vec b\vec c \in \mathbb{r}^3 math
taking the pairwise  of real numbers
math{x+y 2+z\over2}\ne{x+y+z 2\over2} \qquad \mbox{for all }xyz\in\mathbb{r} \mbox{ with }x\ne z math
taking the  of sets matha\backslash b\backslash c math is not the same as matha\backslash b\backslash c math compare  in logic
 
 a  is a set with a closed associative binary operation
  and  are two other frequently discussed properties of binary operations
   and  are weak forms of associativity

the apache software foundation  asf is an american non profit corporation classified as  in the united states to support apache software projects including the  the asf was formed from the apache group and incorporated in  us in june 1999 name incorporation
  name effdate 
the apache software foundation is a decentralized community of developers the software they produce is distributed under the terms of the  and is theore  foss the apache projects are characterized by a collaborative consensus based development process and an open and pragmatic software license each project is managed by a self selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project the asf is a  implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to apache projects the asf is considered a second generation see third generation open source  open source organization in that commercial support is provided without the risk of 
among the asfs objectives are to provide legal protectionsee the  article  to volunteers working on apache projects to prevent the apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission
the asf also holds several apachecon  conferences each year highlighting apache projects related technology and encouraging apache developers to gather together
the history of the apache software foundation is linked to the apache http server development beginning in february 1995 a group of eight developers started working on enhancing the   they came to be known as the apache group on march 25 1999 the apache software foundation was formed name incorporation  the first official meeting of the apache software foundation was held on april 13 1999 and by general consent that the initial membership list of the apache software foundation would be   miguel gonzales mark cox lars eilebrecht ralf s engelschall  dean gaudet ben hyde  alexei kosut martin kraemer  doug maceachern aram mirzadeh  cliff skolnick marc slemko william bill stoddard paul sutton  and  name firstmeeting  after a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation the effective incorporation date of the apache software foundation was set to june 1 1999 name effdate 
the name apache was chosen from respect for the native american  nation well known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance it also makes a pun on a patchy web server—a server made from a series of patches—but this was not its origin the group of developers who released this new software soon started to call themselves the apache group 
apache divides its  activities into separate semi autonomous areas called top level projects formally known as a project management committee in the bylaws name bylaws
  some of which have a number of sub projects unlike some other organizations that host  projects before a project is hosted at apache it has to be licensed to the asf with a grant or contributor agreement name licenses
  in this way the asf gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects 
the asf board of directors has responsibility for overseeing the asfs activities and acting as a central point of contact and communication for its projects the board assigns corporate issues assigning resources to projects and manages corporate services including funds and legal issues it does not make technical decisions about individual projects these are made by the individual project management committees the board is elected annually by members of the foundation and after the march 2015 annual members meeting it consists of   
 rich bowen executive vice president
 shane curcuru
 bertrand delacretaz
 
 chris mattmann treasurer
 david nalley
 brett porter chairman

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 name ada90  codified at   ada is a law that was enacted by the  in 1990 in 1986 the  had recommended enactment of an americans with disabilities act ada and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the house and senate in 1988 it was  on july 26 1990 by president  amended and signed by president  with changes effective january 1 2009 
the ada is a wide ranging  law that is intended to protect against  based on  it affords similar protections against discrimination to  as the http  finduslawcom civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 civil rights act of 1964   which made discrimination based on    national origin and other characteristics illegal in addition unlike the civil rights  act the ada also requires covered employers to provide s to employees with disabilities and imposes  requirements on public accommodations42 usc 12112b5 12182 84 
ada disabilities include both mental and physical medical conditions a condition does not need to be severe or permanent to be a disability    regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities deafness blindness an intellectual disability formerly termed mental retardation partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair autism cancer cerebral palsy diabetes epilepsy human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection multiple sclerosis muscular dystrophy major depressive disorder bipolar disorder post traumatic stress disorder obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia name fr  other mental or physical health conditions also may be disabilities depending on what the individuals symptoms would be in the absence of mitigating measures medication therapy assistive devices or other means of restoring function during an active episode of the condition if the condition is episodic name fr  
certain specific conditions that are widely considered  or tend to result in illegal activity such as kleptomania pedophilia exhibitionism voyeurism etc are excluded under the definition of disability in order to prevent abuse of the statutes purpose name 42usc12102  name pl110325  additionally other specific conditions such as gender identity disorders are also excluded under the definition of disability name pl110325   name 42usc12211 
the ada states that a covered entity shall not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability name 12112a  this applies to  procedures hiring advancement and discharge of employees job training and other terms conditions and privileges of employment covered entities include employers with 15 or more employees as well as   and joint  committees  there are strict limitations on when a covered entity can ask job applicants or employees disability related questions or require them to undergo medical examination and all medical information must be kept confidential  
prohibited discrimination may include among other things firing or using to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability segregation and harassment based on a disability covered entities are also required to provide s to job applicants and employees with disabilities  a reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability and can include among other things special equipment that allows the person to perform the job scheduling changes and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated  an employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship significant difficulty or expense and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements an employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use 
there are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities including the psychological ones anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled
part of title i was found unconstitutional by the  as it pertains to states in the case of  as violating the  rights of the several states as specified by the  the provision allowing private suits against states for  was invalidated
title ii prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level eg school district municipal city or county and at state level public entities must comply with title ii regulations by the  these regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity access includes physical access described in the ada standards for accessible design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity
title ii applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the  it includes the  along with all other commuter authorities this section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services
title ii also applies to all state and local public housing housing assistance and housing errals the  is charged with enforcing this provision
under title iii no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal  of the goods services facilities or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or operates a place of public accommodation public accommodations include most places of lodging such as inns and hotels recreation transportation education and dining along with stores care providers and places of public displays
under title iii of the ada all new construction construction modification or alterations after the effective date of the ada approximately july 1992 must be fully compliant with the americans with disabilities act accessibility guidelines adaag name ada90  found in the  at 28ampnbspcfr part 36 appendix a
title iii also has application to existing facilities one of the definitions of discrimination under title iii of the ada is a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities see  this means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ada was passed still have obligations the standard is whether removing barriers typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the adaag is readily achievable defined as easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense
the statutory definition of readily achievable calls for a  between the cost of the proposed fix and the wherewithal of the business and or owners of the business thus what might be readily achievable for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business
there are exceptions to this title many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by title iii with regard to historic properties those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the  or properties designated as historic under state or local law those facilities must still comply with the provisions of title iii of the ada to the maximum extent feasible but if following the usual standards would threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building then alternative standards may be used
under 2010 revisions of department of justice regulations newly constructed or altered swimming pools wading pools and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people however the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is readily achievable  other requirements exist based on pool size include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit which are outlined in section 242 of the standards however businesses are free to consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule full compliance may not be required for existing facilities section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 standards outline such exceptions 
title iv of the ada amended the landmark  primarily by adding section  this section requires that all telecommunications companies in the us take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments when title iv took effect in the early 1990s it led to the installation of public  tty machines and other tdd  title iv also led to the creation in all 50 states and the district of columbia of what were then called dual party relay services and now are known as  trs such as  today many trs mediated calls are made over the internet by consumers who use broadband connections some are  vrs calls while others are text calls in either variation communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others in 2006 according to the  fcc vrs calls averaged two million minutes a month
title v includes technical provisions it discusses for example the fact that nothing in the ada amends overrides or cancels anything in   additionally title v includes an anti retaliation or coercion provision the technical assistance manual for the ada explains it iii 36000 retaliation or coercion individuals who exercise their rights under the ada or assist others in exercising their rights are protected from retaliation the prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights  any form of retaliation or coercion including threats intimidation or interference is prohibited if it is intended to interfere
the idea of federal legislation enhancing and extending civil rights legislation to millions of americans with disabilities gained bipartisan support in late 1988 and early 1989 in early 1989 both congress and the newly inaugurated bush white house worked separately then jointly to craft workable legislation capable of expanding civil rights without imposing undue harm or costs on those already in compliance with existing rules and laws

many members of the business community opposed the americans with disabilities act testifying before congress  stated that the act had the potential to deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world the  argued that the costs of the ada would be enormous and have a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to surviveshould the senate approve the americans with disabilities act of 1989  december 1989 208  the  an organization that lobbies for small businesses called the ada a disaster for small businessmandel susan disabling the gop the national review 6 11 1990 vol 42 issue 11 pp 23–24  pro business conservative commentators joined in opposition writing that the americans with disabilities act was an expensive headache to millions that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilitiesdoherty brian reason aug–sep 95 vol 27 issue 4 p 18 
shortly before the act was passed  activists with  coalesced in front of the  shed their crutches s s and other s and immediately proceeded to crawl and pull their bodies up all 100 of the capitols front steps without warning  as the activists did so many of them chanted ada now and vote now  some activists who remained at the bottom of the steps held signs and yelled words of encouragement at the capitol crawlers jennifer keelan a second grader with  was videotaped as she pulled herself up the steps using mostly her hands and arms saying ill take all night if i have to this  is reported to have inconvenienced several senators and to have pushed them to approve the act while there are those who do not attribute much overall importance to this action the capitol crawl of 1990 is seen by many present day disability activists in the united states as being the single action most responsible for encouraging the ada into law
senator    authored what became the final bill and was its chief sponsor in the senate harkin delivered part of his introduction speech in sign language saying it was so his deaf brother could understand 
on signing the measure  said 
the ada defines a covered disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities a history of having such an impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment the  eeoc was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment the eeoc developed regulations limiting an individual’s impairment to one that “severely or significantly restricts” a major life activity the adaaa directed the eeoc to amend its regulations and replace “severely or significantly” with “substantially limits” a more lenient standard 
on september 25 2008 president  signed the  adaaa into law the amendment broadened the definition of disability thereby extending the adas protections to a greater number of people name blr  the adaaa also added to the ada examples of major life activities including but not limited to caring for oneself performing manual tasks seeing hearing eating sleeping walking standing lifting bending speaking breathing learning reading concentrating thinking communicating and working as well as the operation of several specified major bodily functions name blr   the act overturned a 1999 us supreme court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures it also overturned the court restriction that an impairment which substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability name blr  
in 2008 the  stated that the amendment makes it absolutely clear that the ada is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability  thus the adaaa led to broader coverage of impaired employees
 the ada had improved access to public services the built environment eg crosswalks with curb cuts and accessible pedestrian signals understanding of the abilities of people with disabilities established a right to equal access to public services and has demonstrated the contributions which people with disabilities can make to the economy disparities have remained in employment earned income internet access transportation housing and educational attainment and the disabled remain at a disadvantage with respect to health and health care name nejm 
 
the perception that the ada primarily helps  was harshly satirized by  in 1998 in the form of an article about the americans with no abilities actanonymous http  wwwtheonioncom articles congress passes americans with no abilities act541  congress passes americans with no abilities act  june 24 1998  the fictional act would have provided benefits and protection for more than 135 million talentless americans and prohibited discriminatory questions such as what can you bring to this organizationscott dikkers and robert siegel the onions finest news reporting vol 1 new york three rivers press 2000 155 
 
the ada has been criticized on the grounds that it decreases the employment rate for people with disabilitiessee schwochau amp blanck for counter arguments  and raises the cost of doing business for employers in large part due to the additional legal risks which employers avoid by quietly avoiding hiring people with disabilities some researchers believe that the law has been ineffectualsee schall 1998   between 1991 after the enactment of the ada and 1995 the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by 78% regardless of age educational level or type of disability with the most affected being young less educated and mentally disabled men name deleire  despite the many criticisms a causal link between the ada and declining disabled employment over much of the 1990s has not been definitively identified 
in 2001 for men of all working ages and women under 40  data showed a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers with the ada as a likely cause

since enforcement of the act began in july 1992 it has quickly become a major component of employment law the ada allows private plaintiffs to receive only  a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations and attorneys fees and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non compliant businesses unless a state law such as the california  name time ada  provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ada
the attorneys fees provision of title iii does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial ada litigation but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain financial reward from attorneys fees unless they act as their own attorney or as mentioned above a disabled plaintiff resides in a state that provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits moreover there may be a benefit to these private attorneys general who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement moreover the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the adaparr v l amp l drive inn restaurant d hawaii 2000 96ampnbspfsupp2d 1065 1082 citing and quoting committee print vol ii 101st cong 2d sess at 1481–82 1990 b2 srep no 101 116 at 15 1989  courts have noted blockquoteas a result most ada suits are brought by a small number of private plaintiffs who view themselves as champions of the disabled for the ada to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled it may indeed be necessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the adamolski v evergreen dynasty corp 9th cir 2007 500ampnbspf3d 1047 1062 dlil v best western encina lodge amp suites 9th cir 2008 538ampnbspf3d 1031 1040  blockquote

there have been some notable cases regarding the ada for example two major hotel room marketers expediacom and hotelscom with their business presence on the internet were sued because its customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms through their websites without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to performhttp  wwwdralegalorg cases private_business smith_v_hotels_comphp smith v hotelscom at disability rights advocates  these represent a major potential expansion of the ada in that this and other similar suits known as bricks vs clicks seeks to expand the adas authority to  where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply
 was a case where a major retailer  was sued because their web designers failed to design its website to enable persons with low or no vision to use ithttp  wwwdralegalorg cases private_business nfb_v_targetphp national federation for the blind v target at disability rights advocates

barden v the city of sacramento filed in march 1999 claimed that the city of sacramento failed to comply with the ada when while making public street improvements it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ada certain issues were resolved in federal court one issue whether sidewalks were covered by the ada was appealed to the  which ruled that sidewalks were a program under ada and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities the ruling was later appealed to the us supreme court which used to hear the case letting stand the ruling of the 9th circuit courthttp  wwwdralegalorg cases public_entities barden_v_sacramentophp barden v sacramento from disability rights advocates 
bates v ups begun in 1999 was the first  class action brought on behalf of deaf and hard of hearing d deaf hoh workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination it established legal precedence for d deaf hoh employees and customers to be fully covered under the ada key findings included
# ups failed to address communication barriers and to ensure equal conditions and opportunities for deaf employees
# deaf employees were routinely excluded from workplace information denied opportunities for promotion and exposed to unsafe conditions due to lack of accommodations by ups
# ups also lacked a system to alert these employees as to emergencies such as fires or chemical spills to ensure that they would safely evacuate their facility and
# ups had no policy to ensure that deaf applicants and employees actually received effective communication in the workplace
the outcome was that ups agreed to pay a 58 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country
 was a case that was decided by the  in 2005 the defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation it was exempt from the requirements of the ada this argument was accepted by a federal court in florida and subsequently the fifth circuit court of appeals however the us supreme court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that norwegian cruise lines was a business headquartered in the united states whose clients were predominantly americans and more importantly operated out of port facilities throughout the united states
 was a case before the  in 1999 the two plaintiffs lc and ew were institutionalized in georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution the plaintiffs sued the state of georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the states community based treatment facilities
the supreme court decided under title ii of the ada that mental illness is a form of disability and theore covered under the ada and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life the court added confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals including family relations social contacts work options economic independence educational advancement and cultural enrichment

this was a case filed before the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan southern division on behalf of the michigan  against university of michigan – michigan stadium claiming that  violated the americans with disabilities act in its 226 million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms concessions and parking additionally the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue with nearly all the seats being provided in the end zone areas the us department of justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney richard bernstein of  in farmington hills michigan which was settled in march 2008erb robin u m fans rave about new seats for disabled detroit free press 9 september 2008  the settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010 and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats this case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the doj the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules name wolffewolffe jerry new wheelchair seats will be full at u ms big house the oakland press 14 september 2008  the agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility name autogenerated1wolffe jerry new wheelchair seats will be full at u ms big house the oakland press 14 september 2008   
one of the first major ada lawsuits paralyzed veterans of america or pva v ellerbe becket architects and engineers 1996 was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase  in washington dc previous to this case which was filed only five years after the ada was passed the doj was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces while section 4333 of adaag makes erence to lines of sight no specific erence is made to seeing over standing patrons the mci center designed by ellerbe becket architects amp engineers was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing this case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ada enforcement that continues to present day
  2002 was a case in which the supreme court interpreted the meaning of the phrase substantially impairs as used in the americans with disabilities act it reversed a sixth court of appeals decision to grant a partial  in favor of the respondent ella williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job related tasks as a disability the court held that the major life activity definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living the issue is not whether williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks theore the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely but rather to manual tasks in life in general when the supreme court applied this standard it found that the court of appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability the court of appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives and placed too much emphasis on her job disability since the evidence showed that williams was performing normal daily tasks it ruled that the court of appeals erred when it found that williams was disabled name cornell  name workerrights
  this ruling is now however no longer good law—it was invalidated by the adaaa in fact congress explicitly cited toyota v williams in the text of the adaaa itself as one of its driving influences for passing the adaaa
 was a case where the  decided that the website of  was not in violation of the americans with disability act because the ada is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace judge  found that the virtual ticket counter of the website was a virtual construct and hence not a public place of accommodation as such to expand the ada to cover virtual spaces would be to create new rights without well defined standards name clr

apatosaurus meaning deceptive lizard  is a  of extinct  s that lived in north america during the    described and named the first known species a ajax in 1877 and a second species a louisae was discovered and named by william h holland in 1916 they lived about 152 to 151 million years ago mya during the early  age and are now known from fossils in the  of modern day   and  in the united states apatosaurus had an average length of  and an average mass of at least  a few specimens indicate a maximum length up to 30% greater than average and a mass of 
the cervical vertebrae of apatosaurus are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of  a  like apatosaurus and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer implying that apatosaurus was a more robust animal the tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb the skull of apatosaurus long thought to be similar to  is much more similar to that of diplodocus apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated to lighten its vertebrae apatosaurus had  that made the bones internally full of holes like that of other diplodocids its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises
the skull of apatosaurus was confused with that of camarasaurus and brachiosaurus until 1909 when the holotype of a louisae was found and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck  disagreed with this association and went on to mount a skeleton of apatosaurus with a camarasaurus skull cast until 1970 apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts when mcintosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to diplodocus were more likely from apatosaurus
apatosaurus is a genus in the family diplodocidae it is one of the more  genera with only  and possibly a new unnamed genus more primitive while the subfamily  was named in 1929 the group was not used  until an extensive 2015 study only  is also in the subfamily with the other genera being considered as synonyms or reclassified as  brontosaurus has long been considered a  of apatosaurus its only species was reclassified as a excelsus in 1903 however the 2015 study concluded that brontosaurus was a valid genus of sauropod distinct from apatosaurus as it existed in north america during the late jurassic apatosaurus would have lived aside dinosaurs such as   diplodocus and 
apatosaurus was a large long necked al animal with a long whip like tail its s were slightly shorter than its s most size estimates are based on specimen  3018 the  of a louisae in 1936 this was measured to be  by measuring the vertebral column name gilmore36  current estimates are similar which find the individual was  long and had a mass of  name seebacher01  name mazzettaetal2004  name henderson  a 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of  apatosaurus and  estimates cm 3018 at  similar in mass to dreadnoughtus name batesampfalkingham2015  past estimates have put the creatures mass as high as  name seebacher01  some specimens of a ajax like  1670 represent individuals 1130% longer suggesting masses twice that of cm 3018 or  potentially rivalling the largest s name wedel2013 
the skull is small in comparison with the size of the animal the jaws are lined with spatulate chisel like teeth suited to a herbivorous diet name fastovsky  the snout of apatosaurus and similar  are squared with only  having a squarer skull name whitlock11  the braincase of apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen byu 17096 which also preserved much of the skeleton a phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a similar morphology to those of other diplodocoids name balanoff2010  some skulls of apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with their teeth those teeth that have the  surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface instead they display a sugary texture and little wear name whitlock11 
like those of other sauropods the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle resulting in a wide deep neck name fastovsky  the vertebral formula for the holotype of a louisae is 15 cervicals 10 dorsals 5 sacrals and 82 caudals the caudal vertebra number may vary even within species name gilmore36  the cervical vertebrae of apatosaurus and brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than those of other s were found to be most similar to camarasaurus by  name gilmore36  name twne15  in addition they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines and have the vertebrae and ribs narrower towards the top of the neck making the neck nearly triangular in cross section name twne15  in apatosaurus louisae the   complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused the dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae instead being loosely articulated name gilmore36  apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body name riggs 1903  the large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight saving air sacs apatosaurus like its close relative  has neural tall spines which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae the shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids giving it an unusually deep chest name lhw07  as in other diplodocids the tail transformed into a whip like structure towards its end name gilmore36 
the limb bones are also very robust name lhw07  within  the  of apatosaurus louisae is intermediate in morphology between those of a ajax and brontosaurus excelsus the arm bones are stout so the  of apatosaurus resembles that of camarasaurus as well as brontosaurus however the humeri of brontosaurus and a ajax are more similar to each other than they are to a louisae in 1936  noted that previous reconstructions of apatosaurus forelimbs erroneously proposed that the  and  could cross in life they would have remained parallel name gilmore36  apatosaurus had a single large claw on each forelimb a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than  name gilmore36  name upchurchmanus  the first three toes had claws on each hindlimb the phalangeal formula is 2 1 1 1 1 meaning the innermost finger phalanx on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one name martin06  the single manual claw bone  is slightly curved and squarely  on the anterior end the pelvic girdle includes the robust  and the fused co ossified  and  the femora of apatosaurus are very stout some of the most robust femora of any member of sauropoda the tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of diplodocus but are nearly indistinguishable from those of camarasaurus the fibula is longer and more slender than the tibia the foot of apatosaurus has three claws on the innermost digits the digit formula is 3 4 5 3 2 the first metatarsal is the stoutest a feature shared among diplodocids name gilmore36  name upchurch05 
the name apatosaurus ajax was coined in 1877 by  professor of paleontology at  based on a nearly complete skeleton holotype  1860 discovered the eastern foothills of the  in  name riggs 1903  name marsh1877  name tmb2015  the composite term apatosaurus comes from the  words apatē  apatēlos  meaning deception deceptive and sauros  meaning lizard name liddell  thus deceptive lizard marsh gave it this name based on the  bones which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs instead the chevron bones of apatosaurus showed similarities with those of s name marsh1877  name holtz2008  during excavation and transportation the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another apatosaurus individual originally described as atlantosaurus immanis as a consequence some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence anymore name tmb2015  marsh distinguished the new genus apatosaurus from  on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae with apatosaurus possessing three and atlantosaurus four two years later marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at   marsh decided to give this specimen a new name because conventions and the relative sparse fossil record at that time meant that then used to distinguish genera and species have now been found to be more widespread among sauropods name riggs 1903  name tmb2015  he named the new species brontosaurus excelsus name marsh1879  all specimens currently considered apatosaurus were from the morrison formation the location of the excavations of marsh and his rival  name om06 
another specimen in american museum of natural history and under the specimen number 460 which is occasionally assigned to apatosaurus is very complete only the head feet and sections of the tail are missing and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted name bakker  the specimen was found north of  in 1898 by  and took the entire summer to extract name mathew1905  to complete the mount sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as marsh believed it should—which had too few vertebrae—were added in addition a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made this was not a delicate skull like that of diplodocus—which was later found to be more accurate—but was based on the biggest thickest strongest skull bones lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries name gilmore36  name riggs 1903  name bakker  name mcintoshampberman1975  these skulls were likely those of camarasaurus the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time the mount construction was overseen by adam hermann who failed to find apatosaurus skulls hermann was forced to sculpt a stand in skull by hand osborn said in a publication that the skull was largely conjectural and based on that of morosaurus now camarasaurus name camarasaurusbully 
in 1903  published a study that described a well preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the  near  field museum of natural history specimen p25112 riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the como bluff in wyoming from which marsh described brontosaurus most of the skeleton was found and after comparison with both brontosaurus and apatosaurus ajax riggs realized that the holotype of a ajax was immature and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid since apatosaurus was the earlier name brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of apatosaurus because of this riggs recombined brontosaurus excelsus as apatosaurus excelsus based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to apatosaurus riggs also determined that the field columbian museum specimen was likely most similar to a excelsus name riggs 1903 
despite riggs publication  who was a strong opponent of marsh and his taxa labeled the apatosaurus mount of the  brontosaurus name camarasaurusbully  name parsons  because of  this decision the name brontosaurus was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what riggs considered apatosaurus and the museums popularity meant that brontosaurus became one of the best known dinosaurs even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries name crafton82 
 
it was not until 1909 that an apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition led by earl douglass to what would become the carnegie quarry at  the skull was found a short distance from a skeleton specimen cm 3018 identified as the new species apatosaurus louisae named after  wife of  who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the american west the skull was designated cm 11162 it was very similar to the skull of diplodocus name parsons  another smaller skeleton of a louisae was found nearby cm 11162 and cm 3018 name glut1977  the skull was accepted as belonging to the apatosaurus specimen by douglass and carnegie museum director william h holland although other scientists—most notably osborn—rejected this identification holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the paleontological society of america yet he left the carnegie museum mount headless while some thought holland was attempting to avoid conflict with osborn others suspected holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton name camarasaurusbully  after hollands death in 1934 museum staff placed a cast of a camarasaurus skull on the mount name parsons 
while most other museums were using cast or sculpted camarasaurus skulls on apatosaurus mounts the yale peabody museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a camarasaurus with the cranium based on marshs 1891 illustration of the skull the skull also included forward pointing nasals—something different to any dinosaur—and fenestrae differing from the drawing and other skulls name camarasaurusbully 
no apatosaurus skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when john stanton mcintosh and david berman redescribed the skulls of diplodocus and apatosaurus they found that though he never published his opinion holland was almost certainly correct that apatosaurus had a diplodocus like skull according to them many skulls long thought to pertain to diplodocus might instead be those of apatosaurus they reassigned multiple skulls to apatosaurus based on associated and closely associated vertebrae even though they supported holland it was noted that apatosaurus might have possessed a camarasaurus like skull based on a disarticulated camarasaurus like tooth found at the precise site where an apatosaurus specimen was found years before name mcintoshampberman1975  on october 20 1979 after the publications by mcintosh and berman the first true skull of apatosaurus was mounted on a skeleton in a museum that of the carnegie name parsons  in 1998 the felch quarry skull that marsh included in his 1896 skeletal restoration was suggested to belong to  instead name carpenter98  in 2011 the first specimen of apatosaurus where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described this specimen  vp 7180 was found to differ in both skull and neck features from a louisae but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with a ajax name barrettetal11  another well preserved skull is  specimen 17096 a well preserved skull and skeleton with a preserved braincase the specimen was found in cactus park quarry of western  name balanoff2010 
 
almost all modern paleontologists agreed with riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus according to the rules of the  which governs the scientific names of animals the name apatosaurus having been published first has priority as the official name brontosaurus was considered a  and was theore long discarded from formal use name taylor10  name endeavour  name dinosauria04  name macintosh  despite this at least one paleontologist——argued in the 1990s that a ajax and a excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus name bakker98 
in 2015 emanuel tschopp octávio mateus and roger benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by 13 differing characters and species separated based on 6 the minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that a ajax and a louisae differ in 12 characters and diplodocus carnegiei and d hallorum differ in 11 characters thus 13 characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera the 6 differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species with only one differing character in d carnegiei and a louisae but five differing features in b excelsus theore tschopp et al argued that apatosaurus excelsus originally classified as brontosaurus excelsus had enough morphological differences from other species of apatosaurus that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again the conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals among the many notable differences are the wider—and presumably stronger—neck of apatosaurus species compared to b excelsus other species previously assigned to apatosaurus such as elosaurus parvus and eobrontosaurus yahnahpin were also reclassified as brontosaurus some features proposed to separate brontosaurus from apatosaurus include posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide the scapula rear to the  and the distal blade being excavated the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bears a rounded expansion and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the  is 055 or greater name tmb2015 
multiple species of apatosaurus have been designated from scant material marsh named as many species as he could which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains in 2005 paul upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of apatosaurus they found that a louisae was the most basal species followed by fmnh p25112 and then a  of a ajax a parvus and a excelsus name upchurch05  their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015 which resolved the relationships of apatosaurus slightly differently and also supported separating brontosaurus from apatosaurus name tmb2015 
apatosaurus ajax was named by marsh in 1877 after  a hero from greek mythology name carpenterampcurrie92  marsh designated the incomplete juvenile skeleton ypm 1860 as its   in 2005 many specimens in addition to the holotype were found assignable to a ajax ypm 1840 nsmt pv 20375 ypm 1861 and amnh 460 the specimens date from the late  to the early  ages name upchurch05  in 2015 only the a ajax holotype ypm 1860 assigned to the species with amnh 460 found either to be within brontosaurus or potentially its own taxon however ypm 1861 and nsmt pv 20375 only differed in a few characteristics and cannot be distinguished specifically or generically from a ajax ypm 1861 is the holotype of atlantosaurus immanis which means it might be a junior synonym of a ajax name tmb2015 
apatosaurus louisae was named by holland in 1916 being first known from a partial skeleton that was found in utah name cm94  the holotype is cm 3018 with erred specimens including cm 3378 cm 11162 and lacm 52844 the former two consist of a vertebral column the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton respectively its specimens all come from the late kimmeridgian of  name upchurch05  in 2015 tschopp et al found the type specimen of apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with cm 3018 meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of a louisae name tmb2015 
the  below is the result of an analysis by tschopp mateus and benson 2015 the authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus name tmb2015 
 apatosaurus grandis was named in 1877 by marsh in the article that described a ajax it was briefly described figured and diagnosed name gilmore36  marsh later mentioned it was only provisionally assigned to apatosaurus when he reassigned it to his new genus morosaurus in 1878 name marsh1878  since morvosaurus has been considered a synonym of camarasaurus c grandis is the oldest named species of the latter genus name foster 2007 
 apatosaurus excelsus was the original type species of brontosaurus first named by marsh in 1879 elmer riggs reclassified brontosaurus as a synonym of apatosaurus in 1903 transferring the species b excelsus to a excelsus in 2015 tschopp mateus and benson argued that the species was distinct enough to be placed in its own genus so they reclassified it back into brontosaurus name tmb2015 
 apatosaurus parvus first described from a juvenile specimen as elosaurus in 1902 by peterson and gilmore was reassigned to apatosaurus in 1994 and then to brontosaurus in 2015 multiple other more mature specimens were assigned to it following the 2015 study name tmb2015 
 apatosaurus minimus was originally described as a specimen of brontosaurus sp in 1904 by osborn in 1917 henry mook named it as its own species a minimus for a pair of ilia and their sacrum name gilmore36  name taylor2012  name taylorampwedel2012  in 2012  and  published a short abstract describing the material of a minimus finding it hard to place among either diplodocoidea or macronaria while it was placed with  in a phylogenetic analysis it was thought to represent instead some form with convergent features from many groups name taylorampwedel2012  the study of tschopp et al did find that a camarasaurid position for the taxon was supported but noted that the position of the taxon was found to be highly variable and there was no clearly more likely position name tmb2015 
 apatosaurus alenquerensis was named in 1957 by  and georges zbyweski it was based on post cranial material from portugal in 1990 this material was reassigned to camarasaurus but in 1998 it was given its own genus  name upchurch05  this was further supported by the findings of tschopp et al in 2015 where lourinhasaurus was found to be sister to camarasaurus and other camarasaurids name tmb2015 
 apatosaurus yahnahpin was named by james filla and patrick redman in 1994 bakker made a yahnahpin the  species of a new genus  in 1998 name bakker98  and tschopp reclassified it as  in 2015 name tmb2015 
apatosaurus is a member of the   a  of gigantic  s the family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth including  supersaurus and  apatosaurus is sometimes classified in the subfamily  which may also include  supersaurus and brontosaurus name lhw07  name taylornaish05  name harris06   described apatosaurus as allied to atlantosaurus within the now defunct group  name riggs 1903  name marsh1877  in 1878 marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder including apatosaurus atlantosaurus morosaurus  camarasaurus and diplodocus he classified this group within sauropoda a group he erected in the same study in 1903  said the name sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names he grouped apatosaurus within  name riggs 1903  sauropoda is still used as the group name name upchurch05  in 2011 john whitlock published a study that placed apatosaurus a more  diplodocid sometimes less basal than supersaurus name whitlock2011  name gallinaetal2014 
 of the diplodocidae after tschopp mateus and benson 2015 name tmb2015 
it was believed throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like apatosaurus were too massive to support their own weight on dry land it was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water perhaps in swamps recent findings do not support this sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals name pierson  a study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout large proportion of pits and fine subparallel scratches of the teeth of apatosaurus suggests it was a ground height nonselective browser name whitlock11  it may have eaten ferns s s s and algae name stevensparrish99  stevens and parish 2005 speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants name stevens05 
a 2015 study of the necks of apatosaurus and brontosaurus found many differences between them and other diplodocids and that these variations may have shown that the necks of apatosaurus and brontosaurus were used for  name twne15  various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed one suggestion is that they were used for defense but their shape and size makes this unlikely it was also possible they were for feeding but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing name upchurchmanus 
trackways of sauropods like apatosaurus show that they may have had a range of around  per day and they could potentially reach a top speed of  per hour name fastovsky  the slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling  or to recoil after strides name sellers12  a trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism though this is disputed name smithsonian  name bipedalism 
diplodocids like apatosaurus are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air allowing them to browse on tall trees some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards and that sauropods like apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding name stevensparrish99  name stevens05  name upchurch2000 
other studies by taylor find that all s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal alert posture they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals apatosaurus like diplodocus would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture name taylor14  name taylor09  kent stevens and michael parrish 1999 and 2005 state apatosaurus had a great feeding range its neck could bend into a u shape laterally name stevensparrish99  the necks range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet name stevens05 
matthew cobley et al 2013 dispute this finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck they state the feeding ranges for sauropods like diplodocus were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation as such they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs name cobley  name ghose  the conclusions of cobley et al are disputed by taylor who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of apatosaurus and diplodocus he found that the neck of apatosaurus was very flexible name taylor14 
given the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like apatosaurus physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed beginning with the assumption that like ns apatosaurus did not have a  the  the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth trachea and air tubes after each breath has been estimated at about  for a  specimen paladino calculates its  the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath at  with an avian respiratory system  if mammalian and  if reptilian name paladinoetal1997 
on this basis its respiratory system would likely have been  with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in  and a flow through lung an avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about  compared with a mammalian requirement of  which would exceed the space available the overall thoracic volume of apatosaurus has been estimated at  allowing for a  four chambered heart and a  lung capacity that would allow about  for the necessary tissue name paladinoetal1997  evidence for the avian system in apatosaurus and other sauropods is also present in the  of the vertebrae though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal wedel 2003 states they are also likely connected to air sacs as in birds name wedel 2003 
james spotila et al 1991 concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not be able to release enough heat name spotila91  they assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat name wedel 2003  some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain name pierson  others suggest that the near horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated name stevensparrish99 
james farlow 1987 calculates that an apatosaurus sized dinosaur about  would have possessed  of fermentation contents name farlow87  assuming apatosaurus had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting metabolism frank paladino et al 1997 estimate the animal would need to consume only about  of water per day name paladinoetal1997 
a 1999 microscopic study of apatosaurus and brontosaurus bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near adult sizes in about 10 years name curry99  in 2008 a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by thomas lehman and holly woodward they said that by using growth lines and length to mass ratios apatosaurus would have grown to 25 t 25 long tons 28 short tons in 15 years with growth peaking at 5000ampnbspkg 11000ampnbsplb in a single year an alternative method using limb length and body mass found apatosaurus grew  per year and reached its full mass before it was about 70 years old name lehmanampwoodward  these estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling name griebeler  one of the first identified growth factors of apatosaurus was the number of sacral vertebrae which increased to five by the time of the creatures maturity this was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936 name gilmore36 
long bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached a study by eva griebeler et al 2013 examined long bone histological data and concluded the apatosaurus sp sma 0014 weighed  reached sexual maturity at 21 years and died aged 28 the same growth model indicated apatosaurus sp byu 601–17328 weighed  reached sexual maturity at 19 years and died aged 31 name griebeler 
 
compared with most sauropods a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from apatosaurus multiple specimens in the omnh are from juveniles of an undetermined species of apatosaurus this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles some vertebrae and limb bones omnh juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals the specimens exhibit features that distinguish apatosaurus from its relatives and thus likely belong to the genus name upchurch05  name carpenterampmcintosh94  juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails and a more pronounced forelimb hindlimb disparity than in adults name svpowbabyapato 
an article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of apatosaurus tails by  and paleontologist  myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail which in diplodocids like apatosaurus was a very long tapering structure resembling a  this computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired name myhrvold 
a pathology has been identified on the tail of apatosaurus caused by a growth defect two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone including the arches of the neural spines this defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints name lovelace14  it has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to  and s and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself name myhrvold

allosaurus was an allosaurid a member of a  of large theropods within the larger group  the family name  was created for this genus in 1878 by  name ocm78  but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of  another family of large theropods that eventually became a  this along with the use of antrodemus for allosaurus during the same period is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on allosaurus in publications that predate james madsens 1976 monograph major publications using the name megalosauridae instead of allosauridae include  1920 name cwg20   1926 name fvh26   1956 and 1966 name asr56  name asr66  steel 1970 name steel70  and  1964 name adw64 
following the publication of madsens influential monograph allosauridae became the perred family assignment but it too was not strongly defined semi technical works used allosauridae for a variety of large theropods usually those that were larger and better known than megalosaurids typical theropods that were thought to be related to allosaurus included     name dl83      and  name dl90  given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of ary relationships none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid although several like acrocanthosaurus and yangchuanosaurus are members of closely related families name hmc04

allosauridae is one of four families in carnosauria the other three are  name bensonetal2010   and  name hmc04  allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the  which would make it  one recent example being gregory s pauls predatory dinosaurs of the world name gsp88cpaul gregory s 1988 the allosaur tyrannosaur group predatory dinosaurs of the world 301–347  but this has been rejected with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods the  name trhj94  allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families with only saurophaganax and a currently unnamed   accepted as possible valid  besides allosaurus in the most recent review name hmc04  another genus epanterias is a potential valid member but it and saurophaganax may turn out to be large examples of allosaurus name gsp88  recent reviews have kept the genus saurophaganax and included epanterias with allosaurus name jrf03  name hmc04 
the discovery and early study of allosaurus is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the  of the late 19th century the first described  in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by  in 1869 it came from  near  probably from  rocks the locals had identified such bones as petrified  hoofs hayden sent his specimen to  who identified it as half of a tail vertebra and tentatively assigned it to the european dinosaur genus  as poicilopleuron  valens name jl70  he later decided it deserved its own genus antrodemus name jl73 
allosaurus itself is   1930 a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae a rib fragment a tooth a toe bone and most useful for later discussions the shaft of the right humerus upper arm othniel charles marsh gave these remains the formal name allosaurus fragilis in 1877 allosaurus comes from the  allos αλλος meaning strange or different and sauros σαυρος meaning lizard or reptile  it was named different lizard because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery name ocm77  name dmlomnipedia  the species epithet fragilis is  for fragile erring to lightening features in the vertebrae the bones were collected from the morrison formation of  north of  name ocm77  marsh and  who were in scientific competition went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of allosaurus these include marshs creosaurus name ocm78  and labrosaurus name ocm79  and copes epanterias name edc78 
in their haste cope and marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries or more commonly those made by their subordinates for example after the discovery by  of the type specimen of allosaurus in colorado marsh elected to concentrate work in  when work resumed at garden park in 1883 m p felch found an almost complete allosaurus and several partial skeletons name dbn85  in addition one of copes collectors h f hubbell found a specimen in the  area of wyoming in 1879 but apparently did not mention its completeness and cope never unpacked it upon unpacking in 1903 several years after cope had died it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known and in 1908 the skeleton now cataloged as amnh 5753 was put on public view name ngd95  this is the well known mount poised over a partial  skeleton as if  it illustrated as such by charles r knight although notable as the first free standing mount of a theropod dinosaur and often illustrated and photographed it has never been scientifically described name bbetal99 
the multiplicity of early names complicated later research with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by marsh and cope even at the time authors such as  suggested that too many names had been coined name sww78  for example williston pointed out in 1901 that marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish allosaurus from creosaurus name sww01  the most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by  in 1920 he came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named antrodemus by leidy was indistinguishable from those of allosaurus and antrodemus thus should be the perred name because as the older name it had priority name cwg20  antrodemus became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years until james madsen published on the cleveland lloyd specimens and concluded that allosaurus should be used because antrodemus was based on material with poor if any diagnostic features and locality information for example the  that the single bone of antrodemus came from is unknown name jm76  antrodemus has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by madsen name dh98 
although sporadic work at what became known as the  in   had taken place as early as 1927 and the fossil site itself described by william j stokes in 1945 name wjs45  major operations did not begin there until 1960 under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40ampnbspinstitutions thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965 name jm76  the quarry is notable for the predominance of allosaurus remains the condition of the specimens and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be the majority of bones belong to the large theropod allosaurus fragilis it is estimated that the remains of at least 46ampnbspa fragilis have been found there out of at minimum 73ampnbspdinosaurs and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well mixed nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the  of the site suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog to becoming trapped in deep mud to falling victim to  induced mortality around a waterhole to getting trapped in a spring fed pond or seep name aphetal06  regardless of the actual cause the great quantity of well preserved allosaurus remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail making it among the best known theropods skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes from less than  name lscc03  to  long and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused name jm76

there are currently four valid and one undescribed species of allosaurus a amplus  a europaeus name ometal06  the  a fragilis name hmc04  the as yet not formally described a jimmadseni name djc00  and a lucasi 
a fragilis a jimmadseni and a lucasi are all known from remains discovered in the –  age morrison formation of the  spread across the states of      utah and wyoming a fragilis is regarded as the most common known from the remains of at least sixty individuals name hmc04  for a while in the late 1980s and early 1990s it was common to recognize a fragilis as the short snouted species with the long snouted taxon being a atrox name gsp88  name lg93  however subsequent analysis of specimens from the cleveland lloyd quarry como bluff and dry mesa quarry showed that the differences seen in the morrison formation material could be attributed to individual variation name dks96  name dks99  a study of skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site found wide variation between individuals calling into question previous species level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns and the proposed differentiation of a jimmadseni based on the shape of the  name kc2010  a europaeus was found in the kimmeridgian age porto novo member of the  name ometal06  but may be the same as a fragilis name mdoe07 
allosaurus tendagurensis was found in kimmeridgian age rocks of  in  tanzania name wj25  it was subsequently classified as a more basal tetanuran name owmr05  before being finally recognized as a carcharodontosaurid name or2011  although obscure it was a large theropod possibly around 10ampnbspmeters long 33ampnbspft and 25ampnbspmetric tons 28ampnbspshort tons in weight name mmdml03 
allosaurus is regarded as a probable synonym of the genera creosaurus epanterias and labrosaurus name hmc04  most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of a fragilis or that were misassigned to the genus are obscure and were based on scrappy remains one exception is labrosaurus ferox named in 1884 by marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down name ocm84  later researchers suggested that the bone was  showing an injury to the living animal name cwg20  and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction name mw00  it is now regarded as an example of a fragilis name hmc04 
other remains formerly thought to pertain to allosaurus were described from  name mfr81  and  name annr14  but these fossils have been reassessed as belonging to other dinosaurs
the issue of synonyms is complicated by the  of allosaurus fragilis catalog number ampnbsp1930 being extremely fragmentary consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae limb bone fragments rib fragments and a tooth because of this several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious and thus the genus allosaurus itself or at least the species a fragilis would be a nomen dubium dubious name based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify to address this situation  and  2010 submitted a petition to the  to have the name a fragilis officially transferred to the more complete specimen usnm4734 as a  this request is currently pending review name gpkc2010 
allosaurus was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of  fossil bearing rock known as the  accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens name jf07  and as such was at the top  of the morrison  name jrf03a  the morrison formation is interpreted as a  environment with distinct  and s and flat s name dar89  vegetation varied from  lining forests of s s and s s to fern s with occasional trees such as the  like conifer  name kc06 
the morrison formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground the flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of   es  ferns s es and several families of s animal fossils discovered include s s  s s s  s terrestrial and aquatic ns several species of  numerous dinosaur species and early s such as    and  dinosaurs known from the morrison include the theropods   and  the s     and  and the ns   and  name djcetal06  allosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as apatosaurus camarasaurus diplodocus and stegosaurus name dbbm80  the late jurassic formations of portugal where allosaurus is present are interpreted as having been similar to the morrison but with a stronger  influence many of the dinosaurs of the morrison formation are the same genera as those seen in portuguese rocks mainly allosaurus ceratosaurus torvosaurus and apatosaurus or have a close counterpart brachiosaurus and  camptosaurus and  name om06 
allosaurus coexisted with fellow large theropods  and  in both the united states and portugal name om06  the three appear to have had different s based on anatomy and the location of fossils ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have perred to be active around waterways and had lower thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains whereas allosaurs were more compact with longer legs faster but less maneuverable and seem to have perred dry floodplains name bb04  ceratosaurus better known than torvosaurus differed noticeably from allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller narrower skull with large broad teeth name dh98   if anyone finds the  where allosaurus was suggested as a female ceratosaurus heres a good place to put it for irony   allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores as illustrated by an allosaurus  marked by the teeth of another theropod probably  or  the location of the bone in the body along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton indicates that the allosaurus was being scavenged name cfj98 
the wealth of allosaurus fossils from nearly all ages of individuals allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as —crushed eggs from colorado have been suggested as those of allosaurus name dfg97  based on  analysis of limb bones bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28ampnbspyears which is comparable to that of other large theropods like  from the same analysis its maximum growth appears to have been at ageampnbsp15 with an estimated growth rate of about 150ampnbspkilograms 330ampnbsp per year name pbetal06 
medullary bone tissue endosteally derived ephemeral mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds has been reported in at least one allosaurus specimen a  from the  name lw08  today this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs as it is used to supply  to shells its presence in the allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age however other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs including this allosaurus individual data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead name chin09 
the discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles and the lower segments of the leg shin and foot were relatively longer than the thigh these differences suggest that younger allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood name fc06  the thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth and the cross section less circular as muscle attachments shifted muscles became shorter and the growth of the leg slowed these changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults which would have moved with more regular forward progression name lcs02  conversely the skull bones appear to have generally grown  increasing in size without changing in proportion name kc2010 
paleontologists accept allosaurus as an active predator of large animals there is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on stegosaurus including an allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a stegosaurus  and a stegosaurus neck plate with a u shaped wound that correlates well with an allosaurus snout name ksmw05  s seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of  based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones name fs04fastovsky david e and smith joshua b 2004 dinosaur paleoecology in the dinosauria 2nd 614–626  however as gregory paul noted in 1988 allosaurus was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods unless it hunted in packs as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods name gsp88  another possibility is that it perred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults name jf07  name lg93  research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question  comparing allosaurus to  sabre toothed carnivorous mammals found similar adaptations such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide although allosaurus did not have sabre teeth bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a  like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw which would have been driven into prey this type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey with the goal of weakening the victim name bb98 
similar conclusions were drawn by another study using  on an allosaurus skull according to their biomechanical analysis the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force by using jaw muscles only it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2148ampnbsp less than the values for s 13000ampnbspn s 4167ampnbspn and s 2268ampnbspn but the skull could withstand nearly 55500ampnbspn of vertical force against the tooth row the authors suggested that allosaurus used its skull like a hatchet against prey attacking open mouthed slashing flesh with its teeth and tearing it away without splintering bones unlike tyrannosaurus which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones they also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods but strong enough for high impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods name eretal01  their interpretations were challenged by other researchers who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey name fk02  the original authors noted that allosaurus itself has no modern equivalent that the tooth row is well suited to such an attack and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the  and lessen stress name eretal02  another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like allosaurus were flesh grazers which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright this strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later name hmc04  an additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats grasping the prey with their forelimbs and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea name jf07  this is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey name kc02  studies done by stephen lautenschager et al from the university of bristol also indicate allosaurus could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force when compared with tyrannosaurus and the therizinosaurid  in the same study it was found that allosaurus had a wider gape than either the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle the findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs like modern carnivores had wider jaw gapes than herbivores http  rsosroyalsocietypublishingorg content 2 11 150495 http  wwwsciencedailycom releases 2015 11 151103213705htm 
a  study published in 2013 by eric snively and colleagues found that allosaurus had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the  neck muscle compared to other theropods such as  this would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull the authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by bakker and rayfield are consistent with the animals capabilities they also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to s such as s the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet then pulled back and up to remove flesh this differs from the prey handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull similar to crocodilians name esetal2013  in addition allosaurus was able to move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control at the cost of power name scidaily2013 
other aspects of feeding include the eyes arms and legs the shape of the skull of allosaurus limited potential  to 20° of width slightly less than that of modern ns as with crocodilians this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks name kas06  the arms compared with those of other theropods were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close name kc02  and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things name cwg20  finally the top speed of allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55ampnbspkilometers per hour 19 to 34ampnbspmiles per hour name pc98 
it has been speculated since the 1970s that allosaurus preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups name jf76 
such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature name dbn85  name dl83  name lg93  robert t bakker has extended social behavior to parental care and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food name rtb97  however there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods name hmc04  and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters as shown by injuries to gastralia name djc00b  and bite wounds to skulls the pathologic lower jaw named labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example such head biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a  or to settle  disputes name tc98 
although allosaurus may have hunted in packs name completedino  it has been argued that allosaurus and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species the study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs is rare among s in general and modern  carnivores including lizards crocodiles and birds very rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way instead they are typically territorial and will kill and  intruders of the same species and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites according to this interpretation the accumulation of remains of multiple allosaurus individuals at the same site eg in the  are not due to pack hunting but to the fact that allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs and were sometimes killed in the process this could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like s and s the same interpretation applies to bakkers lair sites name rb07  there is some evidence for cannibalism in allosaurus including allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments possible tooth marks on a  name bgd04  and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at bakkers lair sites name bb04 
the brain of allosaurus as interpreted from spiral  of an  was more consistent with n brains than those of the other living s birds the structure of the  indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal as opposed to strongly tipped up or down the structure of the  was like that of a crocodilian and so allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best and would have had trouble with subtle sounds the s were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small name swr99 
in 2001 bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for  and  in  dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or  resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb when the researchers looked for stress fractures they found that allosaurus had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than   or  of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied 3 were found to contain stress fractures of the feet 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures the stress fractures in the foot bones were distributed to the   and occurred across all three weight bearing toes in statistically indistinguishable numbers since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress if the allosaurs stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others the lack of such a bias in the examined allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running the authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet the abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in allosaurus provide evidence for very active predation based rather than scavenging diets name rothschild dinorothschild b tanke d h and ford t l 2001 theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity in mesozoic vertebrate life edited by tanke d h and carpenter k indiana university press p 331 336

the ak 47 also known as the kalashnikov ak or in russian slang kalash is a  semi automatic and automatic    developed in the  by  it is officially known in the soviet documentation as avtomat kalashnikova 
design work on the ak 47 began in the last year of world war ii 1945 in 1946 the ak 47 was presented for official military trials and in 1948 the fixed stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the  an early development of the design was the aks s—skladnoy or folding which was equipped with an underfolding metal  in 1949 the ak 47 was officially accepted by the  and used by the majority of the member states of the 
even after six decades the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability under harsh conditions low production costs compared to contemporary western weapons availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use the ak 47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as  worldwide and was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew served firearms as of 2004of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide approximately 100 million belong to the kalashnikov family three quarters of which are ak 47s name k3  
throughout world war ii soviet soldiers found themselves consistently outgunned by heavily armed german troops especially those armed with the  assault rifles which the germans fielded in large numbers name foxnews   name machine carbine promoted   name cover5   name armedforcesmuseumcom   name oneworld publications   name washingtonpost2006   name hallock   the select fire stg 44 was chambered for a new  the  and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle name machine carbine promoted  
on 15 july 1943 a sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the  name englishpravdaru   the soviets were so impressed with the sturmgewehr that they immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber automatic rifle of their own to replace the badly outdated  bolt action rifles and  submachine guns that armed most of the soviet army name armedforcesmuseumcom   name hallock   name englishpravdaru   name field ampamp stream   name gun book review   name american rifle a biography  
the soviets soon developed the  the semi automatic  and the  name virginia1774org   shortly after world war ii the soviets developed the ak 47 assault rifle which would quickly replace the sks in soviet service name nickpatonwalsh   name rossiyskaya gazeta    in the 1960s the soviets introduced the  light machine gun itself an ak 47 type weapon with a stronger receiver a longer heavy barrel and a bipod that would eventually replace the rpd light machine gun name virginia1774org  
the ak 47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the american m1 and the german stg44 name ap kalashnikov   kalashnikovs team had access to these weapons and had no need to reinvent the wheel kalashnikov himself observed a lot of russian army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor and how new weaponry is designed these are very difficult questions each designer seems to have his own paths his own successes and failures but one thing is clear before attempting to create something new it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field i myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so
there are claims about kalashnikov copying other designs like bulkins tkb 415 name popenker   or simonovs avs 31 name kuptsov  
 began his career as a weapon designer while hospitalized after he was wounded in the shoulder during the  name foxnews   kalashnikov started tinkering with a submachine gun design in 1942 and with a light machine gun in 1943 name bolotin p150   early in 1944 kalashnikov was given some m1943 762×39mm cartridges and informed that there were several designers working on weapons for this new soviet small arms cartridge it was suggested to him that this new weapon might well lead to greater things and he undertook work on the new rifle name power custom   in 1944 he entered a design competition with this new 762×39mm semi automatic gas operated long stroke piston carbine strongly influenced by the american  name the ar 15 2010   the rifle that kalashnikov designed was in the same class as the familiar  simonov with fixed magazine and gas tube above the barrel name power custom   however this new kalashnikov design lost out to a simonov design name bolotin p115  
in 1946 a new design competition was initiated to develop a new assault rifle kalashnikov submitted an entry it was gas operated rifle with a short stroke gas piston above the barrel a breech block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine and a curved 30 round magazine name ak akm e   kalashnikovs rifles ak 1 with a milled  and ak−2 with a stamped receiver proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to second round of competition along with other designs
these prototypes also known as the ak 46 had a rotary bolt a two part receiver with separate trigger unit housing dual controls separate safety and fire selector switches and a non reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon name ak akm e   name popenker williams   in late 1946 as the rifles were being tested one of kalashnikovs assistants aleksandr zaitsev suggested a major redesign to improve reliability at first kalashnikov was reluctant given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors eventually however zaitsev managed to persuade kalashnikov
in november 1947 the new prototypes ak 47s were completed it utilized a long stroke gas piston above the barrel the upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver the selector and safety were combined into a single control lever dust cover on the right side of the rifle and the bolt handle was simply attached to the bolt carrier this simplified the design and production of the rifle the first army trial series began in early 1948 the new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics in 1949 it was adopted by the soviet army as 762ampnbspmm kalashnikov assault rifle ak
there were many difficulties during the initial phase of production the first production models had stamped sheet metal  with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert and a stamped body difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails causing high rejection rates instead of halting production a heavy group n26 lb milled from 6 lb stock this was about 22 lb heavier than the stamped receiver  machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver this was a more costly process but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier  rifles machined receiver were easily adapted name browningmgscom   partly because of these problems the soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956 during this time production of the interim  rifle continued
once the manufacturing difficulties of non milled receivers had been overcome a redesigned version designated the  m for modernized or upgraded in russian Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный avtomat kalashnikova modernizirovanniy was introduced in 1959 name e36   this new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted  on the end of the  to compensate for  under recoil in addition a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery without the bolt being fully closed during rapid or automatic fire this is also sometimes erred to as a cyclic rate reducer or simply rate reducer as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during automatic fire it was also roughly one third lighter than the previous model name e36

  original stamped receiver for ak 47  1b modified for underfolding stock a large hole is present on each side to accommodate the hardware for the underfolding stock
this naming convention continues with all types
  
 type 2a b
  the first milled receiver made from steel forging it went into production in 1949 the type 2a has a distinctive socketed metal boot connecting the butt stock to the receiver and the milled lightening cut on the sides runs parallel to the barrel
  
 type 3a b
  final version of the ak 47 milled receiver made from steel bar stock it went into production between 1953 and 1954 the most ubiquitous example of the milled receiver ak 47 the milled lightening cut on the sides is slanted to the barrel axis
  
 type 4a b
  akm receiver stamped from a smooth   of  supported extensively by pins and rivets it went into production in 1959 overall the most used design in the construction of the ak series rifles
 }
both licensed and unlicensed production of the kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the akm variant partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver this model is the most commonly encountered having been produced in much greater quantities all rifles based on the kalashnikov design are frequently erred to as ak 47s in the west although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types in most former eastern bloc countries the weapon is known simply as the kalashnikov or ak the differences between the milled and stamped receives including the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine
in 1974 the soviets began replacing their ak 47 and akm rifles with a newer design the  which uses  ammunition this new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in eastern european nations when the  drastically slowing production of the ak 74 and other weapons of the former soviet bloc
the ak 47 was designed to be a simple reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply using mass production methods that were state of the art in the soviet union during the late 1940s name dunnigan   the ak 47 uses a  that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions name the ar 15 2010   name tilstra   name dockery   the large gas piston generous clearances between moving parts and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle 
this reliability comes at the expense of accuracy as the looser tolerances do not allow for precision and consistency 
the ak fires the 762×39mm  with a muzzle velocity of  name izhmash   
the cartridge weight is  the projectile weight is  name ammoweight   the original soviet m43 bullets are 123 grain s with a copper plated steel jacket a large steel core and some lead between the core and the jacket the ak has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage walls or a common vehicles metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover the 762×39mm m43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone the 762×39mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles yaws in tissue name bellamy p146 155   but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw name autogenerated7   name roberts 2008   name purdy   in the absence of yaw the m43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury name autogenerated7   name bellamy p148  
most if not all of the 762×39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded m67 variety this variety deleted the steel insert shifting the center of gravity rearward and allowing the projectile to destabilize or yaw at about  nearly  earlier in tissue than the m43 round name uthrorg   this change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ~ for the newer m67 round versus ~ for the older m43 round name uthrorg   name fackler   however the wounding potential of m67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes especially when the bullet yaws name uthrorg  
to fire the operator inserts a loaded  pulls back and releases the charging handle and then pulls the  in semi automatic the firearm fires only once requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot in full automatic the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger after ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle the build up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long stroke piston and  carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt the moving assembly has about  of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken the ak 47 does not have a gas valve excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder the kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case name army  
the rifle received a barrel with a  bore and four right hand grooves at a 240ampnbspmm 1 in 945 in rifling twist rate the gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis the muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a  or a  the standard ak 47 barrel does not counteract  as well lateral shift to the right much like the akms offset muzzle brake
the fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle it acts as a dust cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe name arsenalinc1   it is operated by the shooters right fore fingers and has 3 settings safe up full auto center and semi auto down name arsenalinc1   the reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full auto stage and setting the rifle to semi auto name arsenalinc1   to set the ak 47 to full auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever name arsenalinc1   to operate the fire selector lever right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip which is ergonomically sub optimal some ak type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip name arsenalinc1   this lever is operated by the shooters right thumb and has three settings safe forward full auto center and semi auto backward name arsenalinc1  
the ak 47 uses a notched rear tangent  calibrated in  increments from  name scribd1   the front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue the  battle zero setting П on the 762×39mm ak 47 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a  zero name scribd1   these settings mirror the  and  rifles which the ak 47 replaced for the ak 47 combined with service cartridges the 300 m battle zero setting limits the  within approximately  relative to the line of sight soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass the belt buckle of the enemy target any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant as a well aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier some ak type rifles have a front sight with a flip up luminous dot that is calibrated at  for improved night fighting name scribd1  
the ak 47 was originally equipped with a buttstock handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood with the introduction of the type 3 receiver the buttstock lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from    name browningmgscom   such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one piece patterns do not require lengthy maturing and are cheaper the wooden furniture was finished with the russian amber shellac finishing process
the standard magazine capacity is 30 rounds there are also 10 20 and 40 round box magazines as well as 75 round  magazines
the ak 47s standard 30 round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber their heavy steel construction combined with feed lips the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage these magazines are so strong that soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers and even bottle openers name small arms defense journal   name magazine video   this contributes to the ak 47 magazine being more reliable but makes it heavier than us and nato magazines
the early slab sided steel ak 47 30 round detachable box  magazines weigh  empty name dockery   the later steel akm 30 round magazines had lighter sheet metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing  empty name dockery   name scribd2   to further reduce weight a light weight magazine with an aluminum body weighing  empty was introduced for the akm that proved to be insubstantial and was quickly withdrawn from service as a replacement steel reinforced 30 round plastic 762×39mm box magazines were introduced these  magazines weigh  empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of  a  but were actually fabricated from two parts of ag s4 molding compound a  phenol formaldehyde binder impregnated composite assembled using an  adhesive name kokalis   name ag s4   name kokalis_49   noted for their durability these magazines did however compromise the rifles camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations name kokalis_49   a second generation steel reinforced dark brown color shades vary from  to  to near  30 round 762×39mm magazine was introduced in the early 1980s fabricated from  plastic the third generation steel reinforced 30 round 762×39mm magazine is similar to the second generation but is darker colored and has a matte nonlective surface finish the current issue steel reinforced matte true black nonlective surface finished 762×39mm 30 round magazines fabricated from abs plastic weigh  empty name izhmash  
early steel ak 47 magazines are  long and the later ribbed steel akm and newer plastic 762×39mm magazines are about  shorter name dticmil   name tormented  
the transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yields a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight

the ak 47 has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds however every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon some parts of the ak 47 line are riveted together repairing these can be quite a hassle since the end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced name scribd1

throughout the world the ak and its variants are commonly used by governments revolutionaries terrorists criminals and civilians alike in some countries such as somalia rwanda mozambique congo and tanzania the prices for black market aks are between 30 and 125 per weapon and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting name controlarms   in kenya an ak 47 fetches 5 head of cattle about 10000 kenya shillings or 100 us dollars when offered for barter but costs almost half that price when cash is paid name van schendel   there are places around the world where ak type weapons can be purchased on the  for as little as 6 or traded for a chicken or a sack of grain name ecosocdev   name unchr   name kabbani  
the ak 47 has also spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured one gun at a time in small shops around the world see  name santos   name smallarmssurvey 1   the estimated numbers of ak type weapons vary greatly the small arms survey suggest that between 70 and 100ampnbspmillion of these weapons have been produced since 1947 name smallarmssurvey 2   the world bank estimates that out of the 500ampnbspmillion total firearms available worldwide 100ampnbspmillion are of the kalashnikov family and 75ampnbspmillion are ak 47s name k3   because ak type weapons have been made in many countries often illicitly it is impossible to know how many really exist name graves brown  
during the  the soviet union and the peoples republic of china as well as united states and other nato nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world during this time the western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles such as the  the  the  and the  in contrast the russians and chinese used the ak 47 its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make aks in vast numbers 
in the pro communist states the ak 47 became a symbol of third world revolution during the 1980s the soviet union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by western nations including middle eastern nations such as iran libya and syria which welcomed soviet union backing against israel after the  ak 47s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash including drug cartels and dictatorial states and more recently they have been seen in the hands of islamic groups such as   and the  in afghanistan and iraq and   guerrillas in colombia name nprkahaner    
in russia the kalashnikov is a tremendous source of national pride name kalashnikov dies   the family of the inventor of the worlds most famous assault rifle mikhail kalashnikov has authorized german engineering company mmi to use the well known kalashnikov name on a variety of not so deadly goods name moscow times   in recent years kalashnikov vodka has been marketed with souvenir bottles in the shape of the ak 47 kalashnikov name russianvodka   name vodka wired   there are also kalashnikov watches name watches   umbrellas name umbrellas   and knives name knives   name boker  
in  udmurt republic the kalashnikov museum also called the ak 47 museum opened on 4 november 2004 this city is in the  of russia the museum chronicles the biography of general  and documents the invention of the ak 47 the museum complex of kalashnikovs small arms a series of halls and multimedia exhibitions are devoted to the evolution of the ak 47 assault rifle and attracts 10000 monthly visitors name museum   nadezhda vechtomova the museum director stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country
the proliferation of this weapon is lected by more than just numbers the ak 47 is included in the  and its  an acknowledgment that the countrys leaders gained power in large part through the effective use of their ak 47s name gordon 1997   it is also found in the coats of arms of  and the revolution era  and in the 
some western countries associate the ak 47 with their enemies both cold war era and present day for example western movies often portray criminals gang members and terrorists using ak 47s for these reasons in the us and western europe the ak 47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents gangsters and terrorists conversely throughout the  the ak 47 can be positively attributed with  against foreign occupation  or  name nprkahaner  
the ak 47 made an appearance in us popular culture as a recurring focus in the  film  2005 numerous monologues in the movie focus on the weapon and its effects on global conflict and the  market name lord of war  
in 2006 colombian musician and peace activist  devised the  an ak converted into a guitar one sold for us17000 in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of s while another was exhibited at the united nations  name bbc  
in mexico the ak 47 is known as cuerno de chivo literally goats horn because of its curved magazine design and is one of the weapons of choice of mexican drug cartels it is sometimes mentioned in mexican folk music lyrics name aolnews

the atanasoff–berry computer abc was the first automatic electronic digital computer an early    device that has remained somewhat obscure the abcs priority is debated among historians of computer technology because it was not  nor http  platostanfordedu entries computing history   many credit  and  creators of the john presper eckert jr and john w mauchly electronic numerical integrator and computer  filed 26 june 1947 issued 4 february 1964 and invalidated 19 october 1973 after court ruling on   which came into use in july 1946 with the title others cite the programmable british  which was demonstrated to be working on december 8 1943 
some historians argue that the credit undisputedly belongs to iowa state mathematics and physics professor  for his work with the abc with the help of graduate student   conceived in 1937 the machine was not programmable being designed only to solve systems of s  it was successfully tested in 1942 however its intermediate result storage mechanism a paper card writer reader was unreliable and when john vincent atanasoff left  for world war ii assignments work on the machine was discontinued name   copeland2006   the abc pioneered important elements of modern computing including  and  elements  but its special purpose nature and lack of a changeable  distinguish it from modern computers the computer was designated an  in 1990 
atanasoff and berrys computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1960s amidst conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer  at that time the eniac was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense but in 1973 a us district court invalidated the eniac patent and concluded that the eniac inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from atanasoff see 
according to atanasoffs account several key principles of the atanasoff–berry computer were conceived in a sudden insight after a long nighttime drive to  during the winter of 1937–38  the abc innovations included electronic computation binary arithmetic  regenerative capacitor memory and a separation of memory and computing functions  the mechanical and logic design was worked out by atanasoff over the next year  a grant application to build a  prototype was submitted in march 1939 to the  department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis  5000 of further funding to complete the machine came from the nonprofit  of 
the abc was built by atanasoff and berry in the basement of the physics building at  during 1939–42 the initial funds were released in september and the 11 tube prototype was first demonstrated in october 1939 a december demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full scale machine  the abc was built and tested over the next two years  a january 15 1941 story in the  announced the abc as an electrical computing machine with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would compute complicated algebraic equations but gave no precise technical description of the computer  the system weighed more than seven hundred pounds 320ampnbspkg it contained approximately 1 mile 16ampnbspkm of wire 280 dual triode s 31 s and was about the size of a desk
it was not a  computer which distinguishes it from more general machines like contemporary  s  1941 or later machines like the 1946  1949  the  designs or s post war design of  at  and elsewhere  nor did it implement the  that made practical fully general purpose reprogrammable computers
the machine was however the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer
#using  digits to represent all numbers and data
#performing all calculations using  rather than wheels ratchets or mechanical switches
#organizing a system in which  and  are separated
the memory of the atanasoff–berry computer was a system called regenerative capacitor memory which consisted of a pair of drums each containing 1600 s that rotated on a common shaft once per second the capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 bands of 50 30 active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed giving the machine a speed of 30 additions subtractions per second data was represented as 50 bit binary  numbers the electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time 3000 bits
the   of 60ampnbsphz was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations
the  were fully electronic implemented with vacuum tubes the family of s ranged from inverters to two and three input gates the input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function the control logic functions which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and theore did not require electronic speed were electromechanical implemented with s
although the atanasoff–berry computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem an operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions much like the electro mechanical calculators and  of the time selection of the operation to be performed reading writing converting to or from binary to decimal or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers
there were two forms of input and output primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input the intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory the largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two  a trivial problem
intermediate results were binary written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50 bit numbers one equation each sheet could be written or read in one second the reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100000 calculations by these units primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets material characteristics in retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written this problem was not solved by the time atanasoff left the university for war related work
primary user input was decimal via standard  80 column s and output was decimal via a front panel display
the abc was designed for a specific purpose the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations it could handle systems with up to twenty nine equations a difficult problem for the time problems of this scale were becoming common in physics the department in which john atanasoff worked  the machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables  this process would be repeated manually for each of the equations which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable  then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable
 the head of iowa states statistics department was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real world mathematics problems he submitted many of these problems to atanasoff
on june 26 1947 j presper eckert and john mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device eniac much to the surprise of atanasoff  the abc had been examined by john mauchly in june 1941 and isaac auerbachhttp  purlumnedu 104351 oral history interview with isaac levin auerbach   a former student of mauchlys alleged that it influenced his later work on eniac although mauchly denied this shurkin pg 280 299 the eniac patent did not issue until 1964 and by 1967  sued sperry rand in an attempt to break the eniac patents arguing the abc constituted  the  released its judgement on october 19 1973 finding in  that the eniac patent was a derivative of john atanasoffs invention
campbell kelly and aspray conclude
the case was legally resolved on october 19 1973 when us district judge earl r larson held the eniac patent invalid ruling that the eniac derived many basic ideas from the atanasoff–berry computer 
judge larson explicitly stated 
the original abc was eventually dismantled when the university converted the basement to classrooms and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded 
in 1997 a team of researchers led by  from  located on the iowa state campus finished building a working replica of the atanasoff–berry computer at a cost of 350000 the replica abc is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the durham center for computation and communication at iowa state university as of may 2012 it is on loan to the  in  for a major exhibition

the etymology of the word andes has been debated the majority consensus is that it derives from the  word anti which means east name laimeteofilo laime ajacopa diccionario bilingüe iskay simipi yuyaykancha la paz 2007 quechua spanish dictionary  as in  quechua for east region name laime  one of the four regions of the 
the andes can be divided into three sections
# the southern andes south of  in argentina and chile
# the central andes in ecuador peru and bolivia
# the northern andes north of the nudo de  in venezuela and colombia which consist of three parallel ranges the western central and eastern ranges the cordillera occidental central and oriental
in the northern part of the andes the isolated  range is often considered to be part of the andes the term cordillera comes from the spanish word cordel  meaning rope the andes range is about  wide throughout its length except in the  where it is about  wide the  islands   and  which lie in the  off the coast of venezuela were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the andes range but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the south american and caribbean plates

there is one or more highways in bolivia that cross the andes some of these were built during a period of war between bolivia and  in order to transport bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern bolivia and western paraguay

an anchor is a device normally made of metal used to connect a  to the  of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to  or  the word derives from  ancora which itself comes from the  ἄγκυρα ankurahttp  oxforddictionariescom definition anchor anchor oxford dictionaries http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textdoc perseus%3atext%3a1999040057%3aentry%3da%29%2fgkura ἄγκυρα henry george liddell robert scott a greek english lexicon on perseus 
anchors can either be temporary or permanent permanent anchors are used in the creation of a  and are rarely moved a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them vessels carry one or more temporary anchors which may be of different designs and weights
a  is a  not in contact with the seabed used to control a drifting vessel
anchors achieve holding power either by hooking into the  or via sheer mass or a combination of the two permanent moorings use large masses commonly a block or slab of concrete resting on the seabed semi permanent mooring anchors such as  and large ships anchors derive a significant portion of their holding power from their mass while also hooking or embedding in the bottom modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal flukes which hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft seabed
the vessel is attached to the anchor by the  which is made of    or a combination of these the ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope anchoring with sufficient scope and or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed this is particularly important for light modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom where scopes of 5– to 7 to 1 are common whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use a scope of 3 to 1 or less
since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor at this point the anchor chain is up and down in naval parlance if necessary motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it anchors are sometimes fitted with a  attached to the crown by which they can be unhooked from rocks or coral
the term aweigh describes an anchor when it is hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom this is linked to the term to weigh anchor meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed allowing the ship or boat to move an anchor is described as aweigh when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be stowed aweigh should not be confused with under way which describes a vessel which is not moored to a dock or anchored whether or not the vessel is moving through the water
the earliest anchors were probably rocks and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the johnstone paul and mcgrail seán 1989 the sea craft of prehistory london routledge isbn 978 0 415 02635 2 p82  pre european maori waka canoes used one or more hollowed stones tied with flax ropes as anchors many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design  however using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring a large enough rock would be nearly impossible to move to a new location
the ancient greeks used baskets of stones large sacks filled with sand and wooden logs filled with lead according to  and  anchors were formed of stone and athenaeus states that they were also sometimes made of wood such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth or flukes to fasten themselves into the bottom
the admiralty pattern ap or simply  and also known as fisherman is the anchor shape most familiar to non sailors it consists of a central shank with a ring or  for attaching the rode at the other end of the shank there are two arms carrying the flukes while the stock is mounted to the other end at ninety degrees to the arms when the anchor lands on the bottom it will generally fall over with the arms parallel to the seabed as a strain comes onto the rode the stock will dig into the bottom canting the anchor until one of the flukes catches and digs into the bottom
this basic design remained unchanged for centuries with the most significant changes being to the overall proportions and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late 1830s and early 1840s since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor there is a great tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts when this happens the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re set in the mid 19th century numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems as well as improve holding power including one armed mooring anchors the most successful of these patent anchors the trotman anchor introduced a pivot where the arms join the shank allowing the idle arm to fold against the shank
handling and storage of these anchors requires special equipment and procedures once the anchor is hauled up to the  the ring end is hoisted up to the end of a timber projecting from the bow known as the  the crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail this is known as catting and fishing the anchor before dropping the anchor the fishing process is reversed and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead
the stockless anchor patented in england in 1821 name britanchor in  chicago  15th edn 1992 vol 1 pp 377 8  represented the first significant departure in anchor design in centuries though their holding power to weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption in contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes and the flukes against the hull or inside a recess in the hull
while there are numerous variations stockless anchors consist of a set of heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms projections that drag on the bottom forcing the main flukes to dig in
until the mid 20th century anchors for smaller vessels were either scaled down versions of admiralty anchors or simple  as new designs with greater holding power to weight ratios a great variety of anchor designs has emerged many of these designs are still under patent and other types are best known by their original trademarked names
a traditional design the grapnel is merely a shank with four or more tines it has a benefit in that no matter how it reaches the bottom one or more tines will be aimed to set in coral or rock it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure but may be more difficult to retrieve a grapnel is often quite light and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard its weight also makes it relatively easy to move and carry however its shape is generally not very compact and it may be awkward to stow unless a collapsing model is used
grapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand clay or mud it is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode or to foul the tines with use from the bottom preventing it from digging in on the other hand it is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that without a trip line from the crown it is impossible to retrieve
designed by famous yacht designer  this is essentially the same pattern as an admiralty anchor albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms the novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage in use it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor
originally designed as a lightweight anchor for seaplanes this design consists of two plow like blades mounted to a shank with a folding stock crossing through the crown of the anchor
so named due to its resemblance to a traditional agricultural  or more specifically two  many manufacturers produce a plough style design all based on or direct copies of the original cqr secure a 1933 design patented in the uk us patent in 1934  by mathematician  cited by    ploughs are popular with cruising sailors and other private boaters they are generally good in all bottoms but not exceptional in any the cqr design has a hinged shank allowing the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out while other plough types have a rigid shank plough anchors are usually stowed in a roller at the bow
owing to the use of lead or other dedicated tip weight the plough is heavier than average for the amount of resistance developed and may take more caul technique and a longer period to set thoroughly it cannot be stored in a hawsepipe
the delta was developed in the 1980s for commercialization by british marine manufacturer simpson–lawrence
american  invented the danforth pattern in the 1940s for use aboard  it uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat triangular flukes are attached the stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed the design is a burying variety and once well set can develop high resistance its lightweight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store some anchor rollers and hawsepipes can accommodate a fluke style anchor
a danforth will not usually penetrate or hold in gravel or weeds in boulders and coral it may hold by acting as a hook if there is much current or if the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor it may kite or skate over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing once set the anchor tends to break out and reset when the direction of force changes dramatically such as with the changing tide and on some occasions it might not reset but instead drag 
the fob hp anchor designed by guy royer in  in the 1970s is a danforth variant designed to give increased holding through its use of rounded flukes setting at a 30° angle http  offshoreussailingorg assets offshore sas+studies 1994+anchor+testpdf 
the fortress is an aluminum alloy danforth variant which was designed by american don hallerberg this anchor can be disassembled for storage and it features an adjustable 32° and 45° shank fluke angle to improve holding capability in common sea bottoms such as hard sand and soft mudhallerberg don  13 october 1992   this anchor performed well in a 1989 us  navsea testwitherell pw anchor test report for nine movable fluke anchors 31 pounds to 200 pounds navsea rpt no 835 6269039 june 1989  and in an august 2014 holding power test that was conducted in the soft mud bottoms of the chesapeake bay 
this claw shaped anchor was designed by peter bruce from the  in the 1970sbruce peter  9 august 1983   bruce gained his early reputation from the production of large scale commercial anchors for ships and fixed installations such as oil rigs the bruce and its copies known generically as claws have become a popular option for small boaters it was intended to address some of the problems of the only general purpose option then available the plough claw types set quickly in most seabeds and although not an articulated design they have the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force
claw types have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms and grass they offer a fairly low holding power to weight ratio and generally have to be oversized to compete with newer types on the other hand they have a good reputation in boulder bottoms perform relatively well with low rode scopes and set fairly reliably they cannot be used with hawsepipes
in recent years there has been something of a spurt in anchor design primarily designed to set very quickly then generate high holding power these anchors mostly proprietary inventions still under  are finding homes with users of small to medium sized vessels

 mud weight consists of a blunt heavy weight usually cast iron or cast lead that will sink into the mud and resist lateral movement suitable only for very soft silt bottoms and in mild conditions sizes range between 5 and 20ampnbspkg for small craft various designs exist and many are home produced from lead or improvised with heavy objects this is a very commonly used method on the  in england
these are used where the vessel is permanently or semi permanently sited for example in the case of s or channel marker s the anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers including the most severe  but needs to be lifted only occasionally at most – for example only if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance an alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances especially if the anchor need never be lifted at all may be to use a   into the seabed
permanent anchors come in a wide range of types and have no standard form a slab of rock with an iron staple in it to attach a chain to would serve the purpose as would any dense object of appropriate weight for instance an  modern moorings may be anchored by sand screws which look and act very much like oversized s drilled into the seabed or by barbed metal beams pounded in or even driven in with explosives like pilings or by a variety of other non mass means of getting a grip on the bottom one method of building a mooring is to use three or more conventional anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel so no matter which direction the vessel moves one or more anchors will be aligned to resist the force
the mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand  it was invented by  for use by an 82 ton converted fishing boat pharos which was used as a  between 1807 and 1810 near to  whilst the  was being constructed it was equipped with a 15 ton example
it is shaped like an inverted mushroom the head becoming buried in the silt  a counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried
a mushroom anchor will normally sink in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material thus greatly increasing its holding power these anchors are only suitable for a silt or mud bottom since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack the holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight until it becomes buried when it can be as much as ten times its weighthttp  wwwacegroupcom us en assets mooringspdf moorings inamar acegroupcom   they are available in sizes from about 10ampnbsplb up to several tons
this is an anchor which relies solely on being a heavy weight it is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain its holding power is defined by its weight underwater ie taking its buoyancy into account regardless of the type of seabed although suction can increase this if it becomes buried consequently deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable for example in rock gravel or coarse sand an advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged then it continues to provide its original holding force the disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor
screw anchors can be used to anchor permanent moorings floating docks fish farms etc these anchors must be screwed into the seabed with the use of a tool so require access to the bottom either at low tide or by use of a diver hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment
weight for weight screw anchors have a higher holding than other permanent designs and so can be cheap and relatively easily installed although may not be ideal in extremely soft mud
there is a need in the oil and gas industry to resist large anchoring forces when laying pipelines and for drilling vessels  these anchors are installed and removed using a support tug and pennant pendant wire  some examples are the stevin range supplied by vrijhof ankers  large plate anchors such as the stevmanta are used for permanent moorings
the elements of anchoring gear include the anchor the cable also called a rode the method of attaching the two together the method of attaching the cable to the ship charts and a method of learning the depth of the water
vessels may carry a number of anchors bower anchors formerly known as sheet anchors are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel  a kedge anchor is a light anchor used for  also known as kedging or more commonly on yachts for  quickly or in benign conditions  a stream anchor which is usually heavier than a kedge anchor can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted such as rivers and channelshttp  wwwwordnikcom words stream anchor stream anchor wordnikcom   a killick anchor is a small possibly improvised anchorhttp  wwwworldwidewordsorg weirdwords ww kil1htm world wide words world wide words 30 august 2003 retrieved on 2013 03 30 http  webarchiveorg web 20080319014210 http  wwwpusserscom scuttlebutt view 33 the pussers anchor pusserscom 
charts are vital to good anchoring knowing the location of potential dangers as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook one can get by without erring to charts but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them
the depth of water is necessary for determining scope which is the ratio of length of cable to the depth measured from the highest point usually the anchor roller or bow chock to the seabed for example if the water is 25ampnbspft 8 m deep and the anchor roller is 3ampnbspft 1 m above the water the scope is the ratio between the amount of cable let out and 28ampnbspft 9 m for this reason it is important to have a reliable and accurate method of measuring the depth of water
a cable or rode is the rope chain or combination thereof used to connect the anchor to the vessel
chain rode is relatively heavy but resists abrasion from coral sharp rocks or shellfish beds which may abrade a pure rope warp fibre rope is more susceptible to abrasion on the seabed or obstructions and is more likely to fail without warning
combinations of a length of chain shackled to the anchor with rope added to the other end of the chain are a common compromise on small craft
the best rope for warps is  nylon which is strong and flexible terylenepolyester  is stronger but has less flex both ropes sink so avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water neither breaks down quickly in sunlight polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres they break down in sunlight natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water are relatively weak and rot they do give good grip and are often very cheap all anchors should have chain at least equal to the boats length some skippers per an all chain warp for added security in coral waters boats less than 8m typically use 6mm galvanized chain 8 14m craft use 9mm chain and over 14m use 12mm chain the chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice the shackle pin should be securely wired either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles
in  moderate conditions the ratio of warp to water depth should be 41 in rough conditions it should be twice this with the extra length giving more stretch to resist the anchor breaking out this means that small craft under 5m should carry at least 50m of 8mm warp 5 8m craft 75 100m of 10mm warp 8 14m should carry 100 125m of 12mm warp and over 16m the same length but 16mm warpsafety in small craftch 2 royal nz coastguard federation mike scanlan auckland 1994 
the basic anchoring consists of determining the location dropping the anchor laying out the scope setting the hook and assessing where the vessel ends up the ship will seek a location which is sufficiently protected has suitable holding ground enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing
the location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current whichever is stronger as the chosen spot is approached the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back the anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom the vessel should continue to drift back and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight
once the desired scope is laid out the vessel should be gently forced astern usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail a hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts indicating the anchor is dragging or a smooth tension indicative of digging in as the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set if the anchor continues to drag or sets after having dragged too far it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position or another location chosen
there are techniques of anchoring to limit the swing of a vessel if the anchorage has limited room
lowering a concentrated heavy weight down the anchor line – rope or chain – directly in front of the bow to the seabed behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the angle of pull on the anchorhinz earl r the complete book of anchoring and mooring first ed 1986 cornell maritime press isbn 0 87033 348 8  if the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag in light conditions a kellet will reduce the swing of the vessel considerably in heavier conditions these effects disappear as the rode becomes straightened and the weight ineffective known as a anchor chum weight or angel in the uk
using two anchors set approximately 45° apart or wider angles up to 90° from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds to set anchors in this way first one anchor is set in the normal fashion then taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back a second anchor is set approximately a half scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind after this second anchor is set the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable
this moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessels swing to a narrower oval care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range
not to be mistaken with the bahamian moor below in the bow and stern technique an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern which can severely limit a vessels swing range and also align it to steady wind current or wave conditions one method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally then drop back to the limit of the bow cable or to double the desired scope eg 81 if the eventual scope should be 41 101 if the eventual scope should be 51 etc to lower a stern anchor by taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set after both anchors are set tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel
similar to the above a bahamian moor is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel but allows it to swing to a current one of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows the first anchor is set normally and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable a second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable and is dropped and set a swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable and the vessel connected to that
the vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors which is acceptable in strong reversing currents but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors as they are not aligned for this load
also known as tandem anchoring in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other on the same rode with the foremost anchor reducing the load on the aft most this technique can develop great holding power and may be appropriate in ultimate storm circumstances it does not limit swinging range and might not be suitable in some circumstances there are complications and the technique requires caul preparation and a level of skill and experience above that required for a single anchor
kedging or  is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor
in yachts a kedge anchor is an anchor carried in addition to the main or bower anchors and usually stowed aft every yacht should carry at least two anchors – the main or bower anchor and a second lighter kedge anchor it is used occasionally when it is necessary to limit the turning circle as the yacht swings when it is anchored such as in a very narrow river or a deep pool in an otherwise shallow area
for ships a kedge may be dropped while a ship is underway or carried out in a suitable direction by a tender or ships boat to enable the ship to be winched off if aground or swung into a particular heading or even to be held steady against a tidal or other stream
historically it was of particular relevance to sailing warships which used them to outmaneuver opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined shoal water to place it in a more desirable position provided she had enough manpower
 
club hauling is an archaic technique when a vessel is in a narrow channel or on a lee shore so that there is no room to tack the vessel in a conventional manner an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow  this is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway  as the vessel gathers sternway the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack  the anchor is then normally cut away as it cannot be recoveredliardet francis 1849 http  wwwsjohistoriskasamfundetse lb nautica seamanship liardet liardet%281849%29_p72html professional recollections on points of seamanship discipline ampc http  wwwpsychusydeduau vbb woronora maritime workinghtml general principles of working a ship from the new practical navigator 1814 psychusydeduau

anazarbus  med ain zarba mod anavarza was an ancient n city and archbishopric which remaina a latin catholic

rebuilt by the emperor  after an  in the 6th century it became justinopolis 525 but the old native name persisted and when  king of  made it his capital early in the 12th century it was known as anazarva
its great natural strength and situation not far from the mouth of the  and near the great road which  from the  made anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the  and the early  invaders it had been rebuilt by  in 796 ortified at great expense by the   mid 10th century but was then sacked by the crusaders and returned to the armenians most of the remaining fortifications including the curtain walls and  date to this period and were built by the armenians the  empire of egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374
the present wall of the lower city is of late construction it encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine  the colonnades of two streets a  etc a stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south the remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting including roads and ditches hewn in the rock but beyond ruins of two churches a  and a fine  built by  there are no notable structures in the upper town  for picturesqueness the site is not equalled in cilicia and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine s to their sources  a necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations
a visit in december 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed only small isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood a powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction

an anagram is a type of  the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once for example the word anagram can be rearranged into nag a ram someone who creates anagrams may be called an anagrammatisthttp  dictionaryerencecom browse anagrammatist anagrammatist wwwdictionarycom retrieved on 2008 08 12  the original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram anagrams are often used as a form of  as well
any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram however the goal of serious or skilled anagrammatists is to produce anagrams that in some way lect or comment on the subject 
such an anagram may be a synonym or antonym of its subject a parody a criticism or praise it sometimes changes a pronoun into a setence such as with     i am a weakish speller or     radium came it sometimes changes a noun into a verb such as with the example silent which can be rearranged to listen it can also rearrange a noun into a noun such as with    
the creation of anagrams assumes an  the symbols which are to be permuted in a perfect anagram every letter must be used with exactly the same number of occurrences as in the anagrammed word or phrase s are usually disregarded this is usually not relevant for english anagrams and standard  is to be used
anagrams can be traced back to the time of moses as themuru or changing which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in namesof anagrams by hb wheatley pg 72 printed 1862 t amp w boone new bond street london 
they were popular throughout europe during the  for example with the poet and composer http  wwwhoasmorg iid machauthtml hoasm  they are said to go back at least to the greek poet  in the third century bce but this relies on an account of lycophron given by  in the 12th centuryhttp  www1911encyclopediaorg lycophron the lovetoknow free online encyclopedia 
anagrams in  were considered witty over many centuries est vir qui adest explained below was cited as the example in s 
any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question in particular spelling in english only slowly became fixed there were attempts to regulate anagram formation an important one in english being that of s of the anagram or posy transposed in the art of english poesie 1589
as a literary game when latin was the common property of the literate latin anagrams were prominent two examples are the change of ave maria gratia plena dominus tecum hail mary full of grace the lord is with you into virgo serena pia munda et immaculata serene virgin pious clean and spotless and the anagrammatic answer to s question quid est veritas what is truth namely est vir qui adest it is the man who is here the origins of these are not documented
latin continued to influence letter values such as i   j u   v and w   vv there was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be perfect if the letters were all used once but allowing for these interchanges this can be seen in a popular latin anagram against the  societas jesu turned into vitiosa seces or cut off the wicked things puttenham in the time of  wished to start from elissabet anglorum regina elizabeth queen of the english to obtain multa regnabis ense gloria by thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown he explains caully that h is a note of aspiration only and no letter and that z in greek or hebrew is a mere ss the rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century  in his remains commented singling out some letters—Æ k w z—not found in the classical roman alphabetcited in henry benjamin wheatley of anagrams a monograph treating of their history 1862 https  archiveorg details ofanagramsmonogr00wheauoft online text 
when it comes to the 17th century and anagrams in english or other languages there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest the lawyer  was praised through the anagram gestat honorem the physician  took the anagrammatic motto genio surget which requires his first name as georgiusarticles from the dictionary of national biography   courtiers discovered in james stuart a just master and converted  into claims s seat even at that point in time the letters i and j were more or less interchangeable walter quin tutor to the future charles i worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father jamesdictionary of national biography  a notorious murder scandal the overbury case threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by  francis howard for  her maiden name spelled in a variant became car findes a whore with the letters e hardly counted and the victim  as thomas overburie was written as o o a busie murther with a v counted as uhttp  wwwearlystuartlibelsnet htdocs overbury_murder_section h21html early stuart libels http  wwwearlystuartlibelsnet htdocs overbury_murder_section h22html early stuart libels 
 in an essay on the character of a perfect anagram tried to lay down permissible rules such as s standing for z and possible letter omissions on anagrams 1862 p 58  remains 7th ed 1674  provided a definition of anagrammatisme as a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters as his elements and a new connection of it by artificial transposition without addition subtraction or change of any letter into different words making some perfect sense applyable ie applicable to the person named  in  disdainfully called the pastime the torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways

with the advent of  as a poetic movement anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the  the german poet  who made extensive use of anagram techniques came to regard obsession with anagrams as a dangerous fever because it created isolation of the authorfriederike ursula eigler susanne kord the feminist encyclopedia of german literature 1997 pp 14–5  the surrealist leader  coined the anagram avida dollars for  to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism
while anagramming is certainly a recreation first there are ways in which anagrams are put to use and these can be more serious or at least not quite frivolous and formless for example psychologists use anagram oriented tests often called anagram solution tasks to assess the  of young adults and adults alike name   javajava rosalind i priming and aging evidence of preserved memory function in an anagram solution task the american journal of psychology vol 105 no 4 winter 1992 pp 541–548 
natural philosophers astronomers and others of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into latin anagrams to establish their priority in this way they laid claim to new discoveries before their results were ready for publication

anagrams are connected to pseudonyms by the fact that they may conceal or reveal or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity for example  used an anagram of his name in  song  calling himself mr mojo risin  the use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names as happened in the 18th century when  wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the http  wwwhistoryacuk reviews paper pooleyjhtml institute of historical research ihr home page  in a genre such as  or  anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect
pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names thus  becomes alcuinus here v   u or    alcofribas nasier the name  of françois marie arouet fits this pattern and is allowed to be an anagram of arouet le jeune u   v j   i that is arouet the younger other examples include
    tobia gorrio
    ogdred weary   regera dowdy or   e g deadworry and others
    vivian darkbloom   vivian bloodmark   blavdak vinomori or   dorian vivalcomb dorian vivalkomb

    ray adverb
    declan gunn 
    dan abnormal
   a man and a girl
 tom marvolo riddle   i am 
    death cube k
    
   shanghai nobody
several of these are imperfect anagrams letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation
anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit examples
 s  is an anagram for the danish prince  name cb 
 s book  was adapted into the 1999 film  name cb  
 the tapes for the revival of the  show  were labeled with the anagram torchwood which later went on to be used as the name for a 
 the new wave band  best selling album was called 
 hip hop artist  recorded a 2004 album called 
 s album before and after science includes a song entitled kings lead hat an anagram of  a band eno has worked with
 s piano ballad jura ser anomalía literally he she swears to be an anomaly is an anagram of the composers full name his composition for  titled a dot in time is an anagram of meditation which describes the piece the title of his piano piece that is an homage to claude debussy is seduce us badly

 progressive rock group  published a song off their 1989 album  titled anagram for mongo that makes use of anagrams in every line of their song
 the title of the fifth album by american rock band   is an anagram of the bands name and also spanish for the painter
anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity but they also make up part of many other games puzzles and game shows the  is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the united states requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution  puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like confused or in disarray an example would be businessman burst into tears 9 letters the solution stationer is an anagram of into tears the letters of which have burst out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of businessman
numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill some examples
 in  players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words they can steal each others words by rearranging the letters and extending the words
 in a version of  called  the name itself being an anagram of scrabble tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word
 on the british game show  contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters
 in  players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters by joining adjacent cubes
 on the british game show  contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word at the end of the game there is a pyramid which starts with a three letter word a letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution the pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight letter anagram the player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time
 in  players place tiles from a pool into  word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first
 other anagram games include          and

sometimes it is possible to see anagrams in words unaided by tools though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes  could also be used computer programs known as anagram servers anagram solvers or anagrammers offer a much faster route to creating anagrams and a large number of these programs are available on the internet the  or  carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase some programs such as lexpert restrict to one word answers many anagram servers for example the http  wordsmithorg anagram  internet anagram server can control the search results by excluding or including certain words limiting the number or length of words in each anagram or limiting the number of results anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games the disadvantage of computer anagram solvers especially when applied to multi word anagrams is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating they usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often this approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations

in addition ampère used his access to the latest mathematical books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age 12 in later life ampère claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew but a  his reading embraced history travels poetry philosophy and the natural sciences his mother was a devout woman so ampère was also initiated into the  along with enlightenment science the  1789–99 that began during his youth was also influential ampère’s father was called into  by the new revolutionary government becoming a justice of the peace in a small town near lyon when the  faction seized control of the revolutionary government in 1792 his father jean jacques ampère resisted the new political tides and he was d on 24 november 1793 as part of the  of the period

ammonia or azane is a  of  and  with the  nhsub3 sub it is a colourless  with a characteristic pungent smell ammonia contributes significantly to the al needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to  and s ammonia either directly or indirectly is also a building block for the synthesis of many  and is used in many commercial cleaning products although common in nature and in wide use ammonia is both  and ous in its concentrated form
the global industrial production of ammonia for 2012 was anticipated to be    198 million tonnes     name ceresana1  a 35% increase over the estimated 2006 global output of    1465 million tonnes          name ullmann 
nhsub3 sub boils at  at a pressure of one  so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature household ammonia or  is a solution of nhsub3 sub in water the concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the   with 26 degrees baumé about 30% by weight ammonia at  being the typical high concentration commercial product name laroche 
ammonia is found in trace quantities in the atmosphere being produced from the  decay process of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater whereas   and  are found in volcanic districts crystals of  have been found in n  the s secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid  ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater
ammonia is also found throughout the  on      and  substances containing ammonia or those that are similar to it are called ammoniacal
ammonia is a colourless  with a characteristic pungent smell it is  its density being 0589 times that of  it is easily liquefied due to the strong ing between molecules the  boils at  and freezes at  to white crystals
ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or acetic acid both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt

solvent properties ammonia is  with water in an aqueous solution it can be expelled by boiling the  solution of ammonia is  the maximum concentration of ammonia in water a  solution has a  of 0880 g cmsup3 sup and is often known as 880 ammonia ammonia does not burn readily or sustain  except under narrow fuel to air mixtures of 15–25% air
combustion when mixed with  it burns with a pale yellowish green flame at high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements ignition occurs when  is passed into ammonia forming nitrogen and  if chlorine is present in excess then the highly explosive  nclsub3 sub is also formed
the ammonia molecule has a  shape as predicted by the  vsepr theory with an experimentally determined bond angle of 1067° name crc 94thcrc handbook of chemistry and physics 94th ed http  wwwhbcpnetbasecom page 9 26 retrieved 18 june 2013  the central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom this gives a total of eight electrons or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs which leaves one lone pair of electrons the lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs theore the bond angle is not 1095° as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement but 1067° name crc 94th  the nitrogen atom in the molecule has a  which makes ammonia a  a proton acceptor this shape gives the molecule a  moment and makes it  the molecules polarity and especially its ability to form s makes ammonia highly miscible with  ammonia is moderately basic a 10 m aqueous solution has a ph of 116 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral ph   7 994% of the ammonia molecules are  temperature and  also affect the proportion of nhsub4 subsup+ sup the latter has the shape of a regular  and is  with 
the ammonia molecule readily undergoes  at room temperature a useful analogy is an  turning itself inside out in a strong wind the energy barrier to this inversion is 247 kj mol and the  is 2379  corresponding to  radiation of a  of 1260ampnbspcm the absorption at this frequency was the first  to be observed name cleeton 
one of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its  ammonia is considered to be a weak base it combines with s to form s thus with  it forms  sal ammoniac with   etc perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry  moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction  as a demonstration experiment opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride which seem to appear out of nothing as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet somewhere between the two bottles
nhsub3 sub + hcl → nhsub4 subcl
the salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the  and all contain the  nhsub4 subsup+ sup
although ammonia is well known as a weak base it can also act as an extremely weak acid it is a protic substance and is capable of formation of s which contain the nhsub2 subsup− sup ion for example  dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of 
 2li + 2nhsub3 sub → 2linhsub2 sub + hsub2 sub

4 nhsub3 sub + 5 osub2 sub → 4 no + 6 hsub2 subo
a subsequent reaction leads to nosub2 sub
2 no + osub2 sub → 2 nosub2 sub
the combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst such as  gauze or warm  because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia–air mixture the flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25% 
in  ammonia can act as a  in  reactions s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with s although the resulting  nhsub2 sub group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts an excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the  formed  is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with  and the reaction of ammonia with 2 bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare   in 70% yield  is prepared by a ring opening reaction with  the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce  and 
s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with  derivatives s are the most reactive but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the  formed s and s also react with ammonia to form amides ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be  to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present temperatures of 150–200ampnbsp°c are required

ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968 based on  emissions from the direction of the   this was the first  molecule to be so detected
the sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of s name ho  the relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium
the following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected
nhsub3 sub sup15 supnhsub3 sub nhsub2 sub nhdsub2 sub and ndsub3 sub
the detection of triply  ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce it is thought that the low temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate 
since its interstellar discovery nhsub3 sub has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium with a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions nhsub3 sub has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia
the study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer
 
the interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments the nhsub3 sub hsub2 sub ratio has been estimated to range from 10sup−7 sup in small dark clouds  up to 10sup−5 sup in the dense core of the   although a total of 18 total production routes have been proposed  the principal formation mechanism for interstellar nhsub3 sub is the reaction
 nhsub4 subsup+ sup + esup− sup → nhsub3 sub + h·
the rate constant k of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment with a value of 52×10sup−6 sup at 10 k  the rate constant was calculated from the formula k   at 300supb sup for the primary formation reaction aampnbsp ampnbsp105×10sup−6 sup and bampnbsp ampnbsp−047 assuming an nhsub4 subsup+ sup abundance of 3×10sup−7 sup and an electron abundance of 10sup−7 sup typical of molecular clouds the formation will proceed at a rate of 16×10sup−9 sup cmsup−3 supssup−1 sup in a molecular cloud of total density 10sup5 sup cmsup−3 sup 
all other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant  as an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play the reaction
 hsub2 sub + nhsub2 sub → nhsub3 sub + h
has a rate constant of 22×10sup−15 sup assuming hsub2 sub densities of 10sup5 sup and nhsub2 sub hsub2 sub ratio of 10sup−7 sup this reaction proceeds at a rate of 22×10sup−12 sup more than 3 orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above
some of the other possible formation reactions are
 hsup− sup + nhsub4 subsup+ sup → nhsub3 sub + hsub2 sub
 pnhsub3 subsup+ sup + esup− sup → p + nhsub3 sub
 
there are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of nhsub3 sub of these 39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among c n and o compounds  a review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms name ho 
1 nhsub3 sub + hsub3 subsup+ sup → nhsub4 subsup+ sup + hsub2 sub
2 nhsub3 sub + hcosup+ sup → nhsub4 subsup+ sup + co

radio observations of nhsub3 sub from the  reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core the background corresponds well with the locations previously detected co  the 25 m chilbolton telescope in england detected radio signatures of ammonia in s hnhsub2 subo s h h objects and other objects associated with star formation a comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds 
microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including w3oh  w43 w51 and five sources in the galactic centre the high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high density regions are common in the galaxy 
 
 observations of nhsub3 sub in seven regions with high velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 01  in l1551 s140 and  three individual condensations were detected in cepheus a one of them with a highly elongated shape they may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region 
extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the vla in  the hot gas has temperatures above 70 k which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in co  nhsub3 sub was also monitored by vla toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact hii regions g962+019 g1047+003 g2996−002 and g3141+031 based upon temperature and density diagnostics it is concluded that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact hii region 
 
absorption at 297 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the  and probably in ngc 2264 ir as well this detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines 
a spectrum of the disk of jupiter was obtained from the  covering the 100 to 300ampnbspcmsup−1 sup spectral range analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze 
a total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of dense cores by using the jk   11 rotating inversion line of nhsub3 sub in general the cores are not spherically shaped with aspect ratios ranging from 11 to 44 it is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars 
ammonia has been detected in the  and in one or possibly two molecular clouds which are associated with the high latitude galactic  the finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the population i metallicity b type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk 
 
by balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission it is possible to construct a relation between  and density moreover since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2 level system at low temperatures this calculation is fairly simple this premise can be applied to dark clouds regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures but also of a low level of inner cloud turbulence line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous co observations the ammonia observations were consistent with co measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 k with this densities can be determined and have been calculated to range between 10sup4 sup and 10sup5 sup cmsup−3 sup in dark clouds mapping of nhsub3 sub gives typical clouds sizes of 01  and masses near 1 solar mass these cold dense cores are the sites of future star formation
 
ultra compact hii regions are among the best tracers of high mass star formation the dense material surrounding uchii regions is likely primarily molecular since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material since this molecular material can be spatially resolved it is possible to constrain the heating ionising sources temperatures masses and sizes of the regions doppler shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars
 
ammonia has been detected in external galaxies and by simultaneously measuring several lines it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm ~50 k originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc this picture is consistent with the picture within our  galaxy—hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc giant molecular clouds gmcs

albertosaurus  meaning alberta lizard is a  of    that lived in western  during the late   about 70ampnbsp the  a sarcophagus was apparently restricted in  to the modern day  province of  after which the genus is named scientists disagree on the content of the genus with some recognizing  as a second species
as a tyrannosaurid albertosaurus was a al  with tiny two fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large sharp teeth it may have been at the top of the  in its local  although relatively large for a theropod albertosaurus was much smaller than its more famous relative  probably weighing less than 2ampnbsps
since the first discovery in 1884 s of more than 30 individuals have been recovered providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids the discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of  behaviour and allows studies of  and  which are impossible with lesser known dinosaurs
albertosaurus was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids such as  and tyrannosaurus typical albertosaurus adults measured up to  long name russell1970  name holtz2004  while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over  long name ericksonetal2006  several independent mass estimates obtained by different methods suggest that an adult albertosaurus weighed between 13ampnbsps 14ampnbsps name ericksonetal2004  and 17ampnbsptonnes 19ampnbsptons name christiansenfarina2004 
albertosaurus shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids typically for a theropod albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and  with a long tail however tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits the hind limbs were long and ended in a four toed foot on which the first digit called the  was short and did not reach the ground the third   middle   with 4 digits here is no middle one instead there are 2 middle ones the 2nd amp 3rd   digit was longer than the rest name holtz2004  albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14−21ampnbspkilometres per hour 8−13ampnbspmiles per hour  at least for the younger individuals a high running speed is plausible name currie1998

in 2003  benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought the decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary as the two species are  more closely related to each other than to any other species recognizing this currie nevertheless recommended that albertosaurus and gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera as he concluded that they were no more similar than daspletosaurus and tyrannosaurus which are almost always separated in addition several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from  and  and currie suggested that the albertosaurus gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully name currie2003b  most authors have followed curries recommendation name holtz2004  name ericksonetal2004  name ricklefs2007  but some have not name carretal2005

apart from a sarcophagus a arctunguis and a libratus several other species of albertosaurus have been named all of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as nomina dubia and are not assigned to albertosaurus

most age categories of albertosaurus are represented in the  using bone  the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species the youngest known albertosaurus is a two year old discovered in the dry island bonebed which would have weighed about 50ampnbspkilograms 110ampnbsp and measured slightly more than  in length the  specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known at 28 years of age when specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph an s shaped growth curve results with the most rapid growth occurring in a four year period ending around the sixteenth year of life a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids the growth rate during this phase was  per year based on an adult 13ampnbsps 14ampnbsps other studies have suggested higher adult weights this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern tyrannosaurids similar in size to albertosaurus had similar growth rates although the much larger tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate  per year at its peak name ericksonetal2006  the end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of  in albertosaurus although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals lives name ericksonetal2006  name ericksonetal2004  sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small name ericksonetal2007  and large name lee_werning2008  dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and s name lee_werning2008  this pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing name ricklefs2007  name lee_werning2008 
during growth through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that had the association of young and adult skeletons on the dry island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species 
 
most known albertosaurus individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons mainly  where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults and collection bias where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field name roachbrinkman2007  young albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults it has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of  rather than bias and that fossils of juvenile albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did name ericksonetal2006 
a hypothesis of albertosaurus life history postulates that s died in large numbers but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction after just two years juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult albertosaurus and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals this resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains mortality rates doubled at age twelve perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen this elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources and eventually the ever increasing effects of  the higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes high infant mortality rates followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity with very few animals reaching maximum size is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals including elephants  and  the same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids the comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role especially since more than two thirds of all albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality name ericksonetal2006  name ricklefs2007  
the dry island bonebed discovered by barnum brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 albertosaurus the most individuals found in one locality of any large cretaceous theropod and the second most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the  assemblage at the  in  the group seems to be composed of one very old adult eight adults between 17 and 23 years old seven sub adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years who had not yet reached the growth phase name ericksonetal2006 
the near absence of  remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the albertosaurus bonebed quarry led currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the  in  and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour name currie1998  other scientists are skeptical observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought flood or for other reasons name ericksonetal2006  name roachbrinkman2007  name eberthmccrea2001published abstract only 
there is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs including ns and s name horner1997  however only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site small theropods like  name maxwellostrom1995   and  syntarsus rhodesiensis name raath1990  have been found in aggregations as have larger predators like allosaurus and  name coriacurrie2006  there is some evidence of  in other tyrannosaurids as well fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside  the tyrannosaurus mounted in the  in  and a bonebed in the  of montana contains at least three specimens of daspletosaurus preserved alongside several hadrosaurs name currieetal2005  these findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in albertosaurus although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations name currie1998  others have speculated that instead of social groups at least some of these finds represent  like mobbing of carcasses where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and ized name roachbrinkman2007 
currie also offers speculation on the pack hunting habits of albertosaurus the leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of s which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs younger albertosaurus were probably equally fleet footed or at least faster than their prey currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults who were larger and more powerful but also slower name currie1998  juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults filling predator s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods the largest of which were two  smaller than adult albertosaurus in mass name holtz2004  a similar situation is observed in modern komodo dragons with hatchlings beginning life as small s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands name auffenberg1981  however as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare these ideas cannot readily be tested in 2010 currie though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood 
 
in 2009 researchers hypothesized that smooth edged holes found in the fossil jaws of  dinosaurs such as albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to  gallinae which infects birds name wolff2009  they suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food name wolff2009 
in 2001  and others published a study examining evidence for  and  in  dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior they found that only one of the 319 albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did the scientists found that stress fractures were significantly less common in albertosaurus than in the   name rothschild dinorothschild b tanke d h and ford t l 2001 theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity in mesozoic vertebrate life edited by tanke d h and carpenter k indiana university press pampnbsp331–336  rom 807 the holotype of a arctunguis now erred to a sarcophagus had a  deep hole in the  although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological the specimen also contains some  on the fourth left metatarsal in 1970 two of the five albertosaurus sarcophagus specimens with humeri were reported by dale russel as having pathological damage to them name molnar pathologymolnar r e 2001 theropod paleopathology a literature survey in mesozoic vertebrate life edited by tanke d h and carpenter k indiana university press pampnbsp337–363

an assembly language or assembler languagehttp  www 01ibmcom support knowledgecenter ssltbw_210 comibmzosv2r1asma400 asmr102112htm assembler language ibm knowledge center  is a  for a  or other programmable device in which there is a very strong generally  correspondence between the language and the     each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture in contrast to most s which are generally  across multiple architectures but require  or  assembly language may also be called assembly assembler asm symbolic machine code or assembly program 
assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a  erred to as an  the conversion process is erred to as assembly or assembling the  assembly time is the computational step where an assembler is run
assembly language uses a  to represent each low level machine instruction or  typical operations require one or more  in order to form a complete instruction and most assemblers can theore take labels symbols and expressions as operands to represent addresses and other constants freeing the programmer from tedious manual calculations many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development to control the assembly process and to aid

 a macro assembler includes a  facility so that parameterized assembly language text can be represented by a name and that name can be used to insert the expanded text into other code by the 1970s most assemblers were macro assemblers
 a cross assembler see also  is an assembler that is run on a computer or  the host system of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run the target system cross assembling may be necessary if the target system cannot run an assembler itself as is typically the case for small embedded systems the computer on which the cross assembler is run must have some means of transporting the resulting  to the target system   common methods involve transmitting an exact byte by byte copy of the machine code or an  representation of the machine code in a portable format such as  or   through a compatible  to the target system for execution
 a meta assembler is a program that accepts the syntactic and semantic description of an assembly language and generates an assembler for that language http  wwwencyclopediacom doc 1o11 metaassemblerhtml john daintith ed a dictionary of computing meta assembler 
 a high level assembler is a program that provides language abstractions more often associated with high level languages such as advanced control structures if then else do case etc and high level abstract data types including structures records unions classes and sets
 a  is a program that helps prepare a  called firmware to control the low level operation of a computer

an assembler program creates  by translating combinations of mnemonics and  for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents this representation typically includes an operation code  as well as other control s the assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves  for memory locations and other entities name salomondavid salomon 1993 http  wwwdavidsalomonname assemadvertis aslpdf assemblers and loaders  the use of symbolic erences is a key feature of assemblers saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications most assemblers also include  facilities for performing textual substitution – eg to generate common short sequences of instructions as  instead of called s
some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of  specific  one concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous  assemblers from various vendors most of them are able to perform jump instruction replacements long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps in any number of passes on request others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions such as some assemblers for   that can help optimize a sensible  to exploit the  as efficiently as possible
like early programming languages such as    and  assemblers have been available since the 1950s and the first generations of text based s however assemblers came first as they are far simpler to write than s for s this is because each mnemonic along with the addressing modes and operands of an instruction translates rather directly into the numeric representations of that particular instruction without much context or analysis there have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages with  as perhaps one of the better known examples
there may be several assemblers with different  for a particular  or  for instance an instruction to add memory data to a register in a  family processor might be codeadd eaxebx code in original  whereas this would be written codeaddl %ebx%eax code in the  used by the  despite different appearances different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric  see further below a single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations such as  syntax  syntax ideal mode etc in the special case of x86 assembly programming
 
there are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed to produce the executable program
 one pass assemblers go through the source code once any symbol used before it is defined will require  at the end of the object code or at least no earlier than the point where the symbol is defined telling the  or the loader to go back and overwrite a placeholder which had been left where the as yet undefined symbol was used
 multi pass assemblers create a table with all symbols and their values in the first passes then use the table in later passes to generate code
in both cases the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent  symbols this means that if the size of an operation erring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation and if necessary pad it with one or more  instructions in a later pass or the errata in an assembler with  addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target
the original reason for the use of one pass assemblers was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading a  or rereading a deck of  with modern computers this has ceased to be an issue  the advantage of the multi pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the  or the  if the assembler directly produces executable code faster 
example in the following code snippet a one pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward erence varbkwd var when assembling statement vars2 var but would not be able to determine the address of the forward erence varfwd var when assembling the branch statement vars1 var indeed varfwd var may be undefined a two pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass 1 so they would be known when generating code in pass 2

see  below for more details
a program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta statements known variously as directives pseudo instructions and pseudo ops comments and data assembly language instructions usually consist of an  mnemonic followed by a list of data arguments or parameters name intel 1999  these are translated by an  into  instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed
for example the instruction below tells an   processor to move an  into a  the binary code for this instruction is 10110 followed by a 3 bit identifier for which register to use the identifier for the al register is 000 so the following  loads the al register with the data 01100001 name intel 1999 mov 
 10110000 01100001
this binary computer code can be made more human readable by expressing it in  as follows
 b0 61
here codeb0 code means move a copy of the following value into al and code61 code is a hexadecimal representation of the value 01100001 which is 97 in  assembly language for the 8086 family provides the   an abbreviation of move for instructions such as this so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language complete with an explanatory comment if required after the semicolon this is much easier to read and to remember
source lang nasmmov al 61h        load al with 97 decimal 61 hex source
in some assembly languages the same mnemonic such as mov may be used for a family of related instructions for loading copying and moving data whether these are immediate values values in registers or memory locations pointed to by values in registers  other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as l for move memory to register st for move register to memory lr for move register to register mvi for move immediate operand to memory etc
the x86 opcode 10110000 codeb0 code copies an 8 bit value into the al register while 10110001 codeb1 code moves it into cl and 10110010 codeb2 code does so into dl assembly language examples for these follow name intel 1999 mov 
source lang nasm
mov al 1h         load al with immediate value 1
mov cl 2h         load cl with immediate value 2
mov dl 3h         load dl with immediate value 3
 source
the syntax of mov can also be more complex as the following examples show 
source lang nasm
mov eax ebx	   move the 4 bytes in memory at the address contained in ebx into eax
mov esi+eax cl  move the contents of cl into the byte at address esi+eax
 source
in each case the mov mnemonic is translated directly into an opcode in the ranges 88 8e a0 a3 b0 b8 c6 or c7 by an assembler and the programmer does not have to know or remember which name intel 1999 mov 
transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a  unlike s there is usually a  between simple assembly statements and machine language instructions however in some cases an assembler may provide pseudoinstructions essentially macros which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality for example for a machine that lacks a branch if greater or equal instruction an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machines set if less than and branch if zero on the result of the set instruction most full featured assemblers also provide a rich  language discussed below which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences
each  has its own machine language  computers differ in the number and type of operations they support in the different sizes and numbers of registers and in the representations of data in storage while most general purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality the ways they do so differ the corresponding assembly languages lect these differences
multiple sets of s or assembly language syntax may exist for a single instruction set typically instantiated in different assembler programs in these cases the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation
there is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use in particular some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo operation pseudo op a typical assembly language consists of 3 types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations
 mnemonics
data definitions
assembly directives
 
instructions statements in assembly language are generally very simple unlike those in  generally a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction an  and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more s most instructions er to a single value or a pair of values  operands can be immediate value coded in the instruction itself registers specified in the instruction or implied or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage this is determined by the underlying processor architecture the assembler merely lects how this architecture works extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand eg the system 360 assemblers use  as an extended mnemonic for  with a mask of 15 and  no operation – do nothing for one step for  with a mask of 0
extended mnemonics are often used to support specialized uses of instructions often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name for example many cpus do not have an explicit nop instruction but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose in 8086 cpus the instruction  is used for  with  being a pseudo opcode to encode the instruction  some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the  instruction as  similarly ibm assemblers for  and  use the extended mnemonics  and  for  and  with zero masks  for the sparc architecture these are known as synthetic instructions 
some assemblers also support simple built in macro instructions that generate two or more machine instructions for instance with some z80 assemblers the instruction  is recognized to generate  followed by http  wwwz80de z80 z80codehtm z80 op codes for zint z80de retrieved on 2013 07 21  these are sometimes known as pseudo opcodes
mnemonics are arbitrary symbols in 1985 the  published standard 694 for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers the standard has since been withdrawn
 
there are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables  they define the type of data the length and the  of data these instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs programs assembled separately or only to the program in which the data section is defined some assemblers classify these as pseudo ops
 
assembly directives also called pseudo opcodes pseudo operations or pseudo ops are commands given to an assembler directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions name salomon  directives affect how the assembler operates and may affect the object code the symbol table the listing file and the values of internal assembler parameters  sometimes the term pseudo opcode is reserved for directives that generate object code such as those that generate data 
the names of pseudo ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions  pseudo ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer so that one program can be assembled different ways perhaps for different applications or a pseudo op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain another common use of pseudo ops is to reserve storage areas for run time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values
symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names s or symbols with memory locations and various constants usually every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can erence those locations by name thus promoting  in executable code the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point so any calls to a subroutine can use its name inside subroutines  destinations are given labels some assemblers support local symbols which are lexically distinct from normal symbols eg the use of 10 as a goto destination
some assemblers such as nasm provide flexible symbol management letting programmers manage different  automatically calculate offsets within s and assign labels that er to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses
assembly languages like most other computer languages allow comments to be added to program  that will be ignored during assembly judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine the raw uncommented assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made
many assemblers support predefined macros and others support programmer defined and repeatedly re definable macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded this sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic when the assembler processes such a statement it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro then processes them as if they existed in the source code file including in some assemblers expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text macros in this sense date to ibm s of the 1950s
this definition of macro is more comprehensive the use of the term in other contexts like the  c macros created through the #define directive are typically just one line or a few lines at most assembler macro instructions  like  macros can be lengthy programs by themselves executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly
since macros can have short names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter requiring fewer lines of source code as with higher level languages they can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features
macro assemblers often allow macros to take s some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages incorporating such high level language elements as optional parameters symbolic variables conditionals string manipulation and arithmetic operations all usable during the execution of a given macro and allowing macros to save context or exchange information thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions based on the macro arguments this could be used to generate record style data structures or unrolled loops for example or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters an organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher level language since such programmers are not working with a computers lowest level conceptual elements
macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems this was done for example by systems programmers working with s conversational monitor system   virtual machine  and with ibms real time transaction processing add ons customer information control system  and   the airline financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large s crs and credit card systems today
it is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages for example to generate a version of a program in  using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of cobol code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code
this is because as was realized in the 1960s the concept of macro processing is independent of the concept of assembly the former being in modern terms more word processing text processing than generating object code the concept of macro processing appeared and appears in the c programming language which supports preprocessor instructions to set variables and make conditional tests on their values note that unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers the c preprocessor is not  because it lacks the ability to either loop or go to the latter allowing programs to loop
despite the power of macro processing it fell into disuse in many high level languages major exceptions being c c++ and  while remaining a perennial for assemblers
macro parameter substitution is strictly by name at macro processing time the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name the most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name in the macro
 foo macro a
 load ab
the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable and the global variable or constant b would be used to multiply a if foo is called with the parameter codea c code the macro expansion of codeload a cb code occurs  to avoid any possible ambiguity users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions or callers can parenthesize the input parameters 
some assemblers have incorporated  elements to encode execution flow the earliest example of this approach was in the  originally proposed by dr hd mills march 1970 and implemented by marvin kessler at ibms federal systems division which extended the s 360 macro assembler with if else endif and similar control flow blocks  this was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of  operations in assembly code one of the main factors causing  in assembly language this approach was widely accepted in the early 80s the latter days of large scale assembly language use
a curious design was  a stream oriented assembler for 8080  processors from  developers of the  like  operating system and what was reported to be the first commercial   the language was classified as an assembler because it worked with raw machine elements such as   and memory erences but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order parentheses and other special symbols along with block oriented structured programming constructs controlled the sequence of the generated instructions a natural was built as the object language of a c compiler rather than for hand coding but its logical syntax won some fans
there has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large scale assembly language development name assembly languagecat technology  in spite of that they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target systems architecture prevent the effective use of higher level languages 
assembly languages and the use of the word assembly  date to the introduction of the  the  edsac had an assembler called initial orders featuring one letter mnemonics in 1949  soap symbolic optimal assembly program was an assembly language for the  computer written by stan poley in 1955 
assembly languages eliminate much of the error prone tedious and time consuming  programming needed with the earliest computers freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses they were once widely used for all sorts of programming however by the 1980s 1990s on s their use had largely been supplanted by higher level languages in the search for improved  today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation access to specialized processor instructions or to address critical performance issues typical uses are s low level s and  systems
historically numerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language operating systems were entirely written in assembly language until the introduction of the  1961 which was written in  espol an algol dialect many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well including a large amount of the  software written by large corporations   and some  eventually displaced much of this work although a number of large organizations retained assembly language application infrastructures well into the 1990s
most early microcomputers relied on hand coded assembly language including most operating systems and large applications this was because these systems had severe resource constraints imposed idiosyncratic memory and display architectures and provided limited buggy system services perhaps more important was the lack of first class high level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use a psychological factor may have also played a role the first generation of microcomputer programmers retained a hobbyist wires and pliers attitude
in a more commercial context the biggest reasons for using assembly language were minimal bloat size minimal overhead greater speed and reliability
typical examples of large assembly language programs from this time are ibm pc  operating systems and early applications such as the  program  even into the 1990s most console video games were written in assembly including most games for the  and the  according to some industry insiders the assembly language was the best computer language to use to get the best performance out of the  a console that was notoriously challenging to develop and program games forhttp  wwweidolons innnet tiki indexphppage segabase+saturn eidolons inn segabase saturn   bot generated title     the arcade game  1993 is another example
assembly language has long been the primary development language for many popular home computers of the 1980s and 1990s such as the     and  this was in large part because  basic dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed as well as insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware on these systems some systems even have an  ide with highly advanced debugging and macro facilities
the assembler for the  was written by don french and published by french silk at 1639 bytes in length its author believes it is the smallest symbolic assembler ever written the assembler supported the usual symbolic addressing and the definition of s or hex strings it also allows address expressions which can be combined with       and  operators 
there have always been debates over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high level languages assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important see below assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size in the case of speed optimization modern s are claimed   to render high level languages into code that can run as fast as hand written assembly despite the counter examples that can be found name goto  name bit fild  name gcc mess  the complexity of modern processors and memory sub systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers as well as assembly programmers name greatdebate1  name compiler fails1  moreover increasing processor performance has meant that most cpus sit idle most of the time  with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses  operations and  this has made raw code execution speed a non issue for many programmers
there are some situations in which developers might choose to use assembly language
 a stand alone executable of compact size is required that must execute without recourse to the  components or  associated with a high level language this is perhaps the most common situation for example firmware for telephones automobile fuel and ignition systems air conditioning control systems security systems and sensors
 code that must interact directly with the hardware for example in s and s
 in an embedded processor or dsp high repetition interrupts require the shortest number of cycles per interrupt such as an interrupt that occurs 1000 or 10000 times a second
 programs that need to use processor specific instructions not implemented in a compiler a common example is the  instruction at the core of many encryption algorithms as well as querying the parity of a byte or the 4 bit carry of an addition
 programs that create vectorized functions for programs in higher level languages such as c  in the higher level language this is sometimes aided by compiler s which map directly to simd mnemonics but nevertheless result in a one to one assembly conversion specific for the given vector processor
 programs requiring extreme optimization for example  an inner  in a processor intensive algorithm s take advantage of the abilities of hardware features in systems enabling games to run faster also large scientific simulations require highly optimized algorithms eg  with  name goto  name bench  or  eg  assembly version from  
 situations where no high level language exists on a new or specialized processor for example
 programs that need precise timing such as
  programs such as simulations flight navigation systems and medical equipment for example in a  system telemetry must be interpreted and acted upon within strict time constraints such systems must eliminate sources of unpredictable delays which may be created by some interpreted languages automatic  paging operations or  however some higher level languages incorporate run time components and operating system interfaces that can introduce such delays choosing assembly or lower level languages for such systems gives programmers greater visibility and control over processing details
 cryptographic algorithms that must always take strictly the same time to execute preventing s
 situations where complete control over the environment is required in extremely high security situations where 
 es s certain s or other items very close to the hardware or low level operating system
  s for monitoring tracing and  where additional overhead is kept to a minimum
  and modifying program files such as
existing  that may or may not have originally been written in a high level language for example when trying to recreate programs for which source code is not available or has been lost or cracking copy protection of proprietary software
 s also termed  which is possible via several methods the most widely employed method is altering program code at the assembly language level
  to which assembly language lends itself well
  and other software for s 
assembly language is still taught in most  and  programs although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool the underlying concepts remain very important such fundamental topics as     encoding  processing and  design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level since a computers behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language most modern computers have similar instruction sets theore studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn i the basic concepts ii to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate and iii to see how efficient executable code can be created from high level languages
  this is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations eg long division although s are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations
assembly language is typically used in a systems  code the low level code that initializes and tests the system hardware prior to booting the operating system and is often stored in    on ibm compatible  systems and  is an example
some compilers translate high level languages into assembly first before fully compiling allowing the assembly code to be viewed for ging and optimization purposes
relatively low level languages such as  allow the programmer to embed assembly language directly in the source code programs using such facilities such as the  can then construct abstractions using different assembly language on each hardware platform the systems  code can then use these processor specific components through a uniform interface
assembly language is useful in  many programs are distributed only in machine code form which is straightforward to translate into assembly language but more difficult to translate into a higher level language tools such as the  make extensive use of disassembly for such a purpose
assemblers can be used to generate blocks of data with no high level language overhead from formatted and commented source code to be used by other code
for any given personal computer mainframe embedded system and game console both past and present at least one – possibly dozens – of assemblers have been written for some examples see the 
on  systems the assembler is traditionally called  although it is not a single body of code being typically written anew for each port a number of unix variants use the  called as or gas which is a cross assembler for many host systems and many targets
within processor groups each assembler has its own dialect sometimes some assemblers can read another assemblers dialect for example  can read old  code but not the reverse  and  have similar syntax but each support different macros that could make them difficult to translate to each other the basics are all the same but the advanced features will differ name hyde 
also assembly can sometimes be portable across different operating systems on the same type of  s between operating systems often differ slightly or not at all and with care it is possible to gain some portability in assembly language usually by linking with a  library that does not change between operating systems an   can process the    of any assembler to achieve portability even across s with an overhead no greater than a typical bytecode interpreter this is similar to use of microcode to achieve compatibility across a processor family
some higher level computer languages such as  and  support  where sections of assembly code in practice usually brief can be embedded into the high level language code the  language commonly contains an assembler used in code words
an  can be used to debug assembly language programs

in the ancient  ambrosia  is sometimes the food or drink of the greek gods often depicted as conferring  or  upon whoever consumed it name ocd  it was brought to the gods in  by   xii62  so it may have been thought of in the homeric tradition as a kind of divine exhalation of the earth
ambrosia is sometimes depicted in ancient art as distributed by a  labeled with that nameruth e leader newby silver and society in late antiquity functions and meanings of silver plate in the fourth to seventh centuries ashgate 2004 p 133 christine kondoleon domestic and divine roman mosaics in the house of dionysos cornell university press 1995 p 246 katherine m d dunbabin mosaics of the greek and roman world cambridge university press 1999 pp 136 142 276–277  in the  an opponent to the wine god  violence committed against ambrosia turns her into a grapevine
ambrosia is very closely related to the gods other form of sustenance  the two terms may not have originally been distinguishedattempts to draw any significant distinctions between the functions of nectar and ambrosia have failed clay p 114  though in s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods it was with ambrosia hera cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh  xiv170  and with ambrosia athena prepared  in her sleep  xviii188ff  so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors the effects of years had been stripped away and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her on the other hand in  fragment 42  nectar is the food and in  fragment 141 lp  and  ambrosia is the drinkwhen anaxandrides says i eat nectar and drink ambrosia wright p 5 suggested he was using comic inversion  when a character in   says i dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head—out of a ladle the homely and realistic ladle brings the ineffable moment to ground with a thump both descriptions however could be correct as ambrosia could be a liquid that is considered a meal much like how soup is labeled the same
the consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings upon his assumption into immortality on olympus  is given ambrosia by  while the hero  is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains in one version of the myth of  part of tantalus crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself he attempts to steal some away to give to other mortals olympian odes 1 50 ff  those who consume ambrosia typically had not blood in their veins but   v 340 416

among later writers ambrosia has been so often used with generic meanings of delightful liquid that such late writers as  us and  employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery name referenceain athenaeus a sauce of oil water and fruit juice  medicine name in paulus a medicinal draughtin paulus a medicinal draught  and botany name referencebdioscurides remarked its latin name was ros marinus sea dew or  these uses were noted by wright 19176   used the term in connection with different plants as did early herbalists name chambersambrosia in  london  1961 vol 1 p 315 
additionally some modern  such as  identify ambrosia with the  mushroom  it was the food of the gods their ambrosia and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices staples asserts name referenceccarl ap ruck and danny staples the world of classical myth 199426 
 thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of  in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey which is in fact anti septic and because fermented honey  preceded  as an  in the aegean world on some minoan seals goddesses were represented with  faces compare  and 
 a hive product also known for its sweet fruity taste is used as a remedy for sore throats and there are many modern proprietary medicines which use honey as an ingredient
the concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two  areas greek and  the greek ἀμβροσία ambrosia is semantically linked to the sanskrit   as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality the two words appear to be derived from the same indo european form ṇ mṛ tós un dying name eiec mallory also connects to this root an avestan word and notes that the root is dialectally restricted to the ie southeast  n  negative pix from which the pix a  in both greek and sanskrit are derived mṛ  of mer  to die and  to  adjectival suffix a semantically similar etymology exists for  the beverage of the gods greek νέκταρ néktar presumed to be a compound of the  roots nek  death and  tar overcoming
 
however the connection that has derived ambrosia from the greek pix a  not and the word brotos mortal hence the food or drink of the immortals has been questioned as coincidental by some modern linguistsso noted by wright 19176

aurelius ambrosius better known in english as saint ambrose  c 3404 april 397 was a  who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century he was  of  and  headquartered in milan before being made bishop of milan by popular acclamation in 374 ambrose was a staunch opponent of  and has been accused of fostering persecutions of arians s and s
traditionally ambrose is credited with promoting antiphonal chant a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other as well as with composing  a  hymn
ambrose was one of the four original  and is the  of milan he is notable for his influence on 
ambrose was born into a   family about 340 ad and was raised in  name ce  his father was aurelius ambrosius  the  his mother was a woman of intellect and piety ambroses siblings  who is the subject of ambroses de excessu fratris satyri and  are also venerated as saints  there is a legend that as an infant a swarm of s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle leaving behind a drop of  his father considered this a  of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue for this reason bees and  often appear in the 
after the early death of his father ambrose followed his fathers career he was educated in rome studying   and    first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him  or governor of  and  with headquarters at  which was then beside rome the second capital in italy
ambrose was the governor of aemilia liguria in northern italy until 374 when he became the bishop of milan he was a very popular political figure and since he was the governor in the effective capital in the roman west he was a recognizable figure in the court of the   ambrose never married
in the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the  between the catholics and   in 374  an arian died and the arians challenged the  ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place to prevent an uproar which was probable in this crisis his address was interrupted by a call ambrose bishop which was taken up by the whole assembly
ambrose was known to be catholic in belief but also acceptable to arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard at first he energetically used the office for which he was in no way prepared ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in  upon his appointment ambrose fled to a colleagues home seeking to hide upon receiving a letter from the emperor  praising the appropriateness of rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions ambroses host gave him up within a week he was baptized ordained and duly consecrated bishop of 
as bishop he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle apportioned his money to the poor donating all of his land making only provision for his sister  who later became a nun name   ce   and committed the care of his family to his brother this raised his popularity even further giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of the goodness of death
according to legend ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped  in milan he studied theology with  a  of rome using his excellent knowledge of greek which was then rare in the west to his advantage he studied the old testament and greek authors like    and  with whom he was also exchanging letters  he applied this knowledge as preacher concentrating especially on exegesis of the old testament and his rhetorical abilities impressed  who hitherto had thought poorly of christian preachers
in the confrontation with arians ambrose sought to theologically ute their propositions which were contrary to the  and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy the arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the western and eastern empires although the western emperor  supported orthodoxy the younger  who became his colleague in the empire adhered to the arian creed ambrose did not sway the young princes position in the east emperor  likewise professed the nicene creed but there were many adherents of arianism throughout his dominions especially among the higher clergy
in this contested state of religious opinion two leaders of the arians bishops  and secundianus of  confident of numbers prevailed upon gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire this request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation however ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the western bishops accordingly a  composed of thirty two bishops was held at  in the year 381 ambrose was elected president and palladius being called upon to defend his opinions declined a vote was then taken when palladius and his associate secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices
nevertheless the increasing strength of the arians proved a formidable task for ambrose in 385 or 386 the emperor and his mother  along with a considerable number of  and  especially military professed arianism they demanded two churches in  one in the city the  of the apostles the other in the suburbs st victors to the arians ambrose used and was required to answer for his conduct before the council he went his eloquence in defense of the church reportedly overawing the ministers of valentinian so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches the day following when he was performing  in the basilica the pect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the portian basilica in the suburbs as he still used certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the portian basilica by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of 
in spite of imperial opposition bishop ambrose declared
the imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of ambrose however his aid was soon solicited by the emperor when  usurped the supreme power in  and was meditating a descent upon italy valentinian sent ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking and the embassy was successful
a second later embassy was unsuccessful the enemy entered  and  was taken justina and her son fled but ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief
in 385 ambrose backed by milans populace used s imperial request to hand over the portian basilica for the use of arian troops in 386 justina and valentinian received the arian bishop  and ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in milan for arian usage ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church and the imperial order was rescinded

soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the  theodosius died at milan in 395 and two years later april 4 397 ambrose also died he was succeeded as bishop of milan by  ambroses body may still be viewed in the  in milan where it has been continuously veneratedampnbsp— along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of 
many circumstances in the history of ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times the chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period but it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people
he was generous to the  it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times and he introduced popular orms in the order and manner of public worship it is alleged too that at a time when the influence of ambrose required vigorous support he was admonished in a dream to search for and found under the pavement of the church the remains of two s  the saints although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old looked as if they had just died the applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party
ambrose ranks with   and  as one of the   theologians compare him with  who they claim fell short of ambroses administrative excellence but demonstrated greater  ability he succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of  and  subjects
ambroses intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing  of the church and its  ministry while the prevalent  of the day continuing the  and nian training of his youth enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of christian  thus we have the de officiis ministrorum de viduis de virginitate and de paenitentia
ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping god and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place his advice to augustine of hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom when i am at rome i fast on a saturday when i am at milan i do not follow the custom of the church where you are   thus ambrose used to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the right liturgical form where there was no substantial problem his advice has remained in the english language as the saying 
one interpretation of ambroses writings is that he was a  name hanson  it has been noted that ambroses theology was significantly influenced by that of  and  two other early christian universalists name hanson   one quotation cited in favor of this belief
one could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream christian belief in a general resurrection both for those in heaven and for those in hell several other works by ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation for example
ambrose considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders but a part of the united solidary people giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but as a repayment of resources that god had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped 
the theological treatises of ambrose of milan would come to influence popes   and  central to ambrose is the  of mary and her role as http  wwwsydneycatholicorg news latest_news 2009 2009127_1306shtml st ambrose catholic communications sydney archdiocese

this is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion the practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become in a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds in which the production of books was very labor intensive the majority of the population was illiterate and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent lection however there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual

first the starting resin must be resistant to decay many trees produce resin but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological process exposure to sunlight rain and temperate extremes tends to disintegrate resin and the process is assisted by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi for resin to survive long enough to become amber it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude thosepoinar george o 1992 life in amber stanford calif stanford university press p 12 isbn 0804720010 
fossil resins from europe fall into two categories the famous baltic ambers and another that resembles the  group fossil resins from the americas and africa are closely related to the modern genus  
while baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from  family plants that used to live in north europe 
the abnormal development of resin has been called succinosis impurities are quite often present especially when the resin dropped onto the ground so that the material may be useless except for varnish making whence the impure amber is called firniss enclosures of  may give a bluish color to amber the so called black amber is only a kind of  bony amber owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin

 yields on dry distillation succinic acid the proportion varying from about 3% to 8% and being greatest in the pale opaque or bony varieties the aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid hence the name succinite succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3 which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins its specific gravity varies from 105 to 110 it can be distinguished from other ambers via  due to a specific  absorption peak ir spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample succinic acid may not be an original component of amber but rather a degradation product of abietic acid name rottlaender1970

the alphorn or alpenhorn or alpine horn is a  consisting of a wooden  of  having a wooden cup shaped  used by mountain dwellers in  and elsewhere similar wooden horns were used for  in most mountainous regions of  from the  to the 
for a long time scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the roman etruscan  because of their resemblance in shape and because of the word liti meaning alphorn in the dialect of  there is no documented evidence for this theory however and the word liti was probably borrowed from 16th–18th century writings in latin where the word lituus could describe various wind instruments such as the  the  or the   does this mean that the dialect name liti is not found until after the 18th century or that it goes back much further if the latter were these latin writings from three centuries unanimous in using the lituus for all three of these instrument types and further does this mean the crumhorn was actually still in use in the 18th century   swiss naturalist  used the words lituum alpinum for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his de raris et admirandis herbis in 1555 the oldest known document using the german word alphorn is a page from a 1527 account book from the former  abbey st urban near  mentioning the payment of two  for an itinerant alphorn player from the 
17th–19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier sometimes substituting for the lack of  surviving artifacts dating back to as far as ca ad 1400 include wooden  in their stretched form like the alphorn or coiled versions such as the büchel and the allgäuisches waldhorn or ackerhorn the alphorns exact origins remain indeterminate and the ubiquity of horn like signal instruments in valleys throughout europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage
the alphorn is carved from solid softwood generally spruce but sometimes pine in former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn but modern makers piece the wood together at the base   a cup shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete
an alphorn made at rigi kulm schwyz and now in the  measures 8ampnbspft in length and has a straight tube  the swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality being curved near the bell in the bernese oberland   mentions an alphorn like instrument under the name of hölzern trummet wooden trumpet in syntagma musicum wittenberg 1615–1619 pl viii
the alphorn has no lateral openings and theore gives the pure  of the open pipe the notes of the natural harmonic series overlap but do not exactly correspond to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard western  most prominently within the alphorns range the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale
accomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves consisting of the 2nd through the 16th notes of the harmonic series  the availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn

the  was one of the earliest known professional armies boys were sent to a  at the age of seven to train for being a soldier at the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family after that men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60 unlike other civilizations whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons the spartan s or s did the manual labor
this allowed the spartans to field a full time army with a campaign season that lasted all year the spartan army was largely composed of s equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other each hoplite bore the spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform the main pieces of this armor were a round shield a spear and a helmet
the  had its origins in the citizen army of the  which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for rome  turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens but these citizens  for 25 years before being discharged
the romans were also noted for making use of  non romans who served with the s and filled roles that the traditional roman military could not fill effectively such as  and  after their service in the army they were made citizens of rome and then their children were citizens also they were also given land and money to settle in rome in the  these auxiliary troops along with foreign mercenaries became the core of the roman army moreover by the time of the late roman empire tribes such as the  were paid to serve as 
in the earliest  it was the obligation of every  to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment archers and infantry this decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time but could lead to motley forces with variable training equipment and abilities the more resources the noble had access to the better his troops would be
the s were drawn to battle by feudal and social obligation and also by the prospect of profit and advancement those who performed well were likely to increase their landholdings and advance in the social hierarchy the prospect of significant income from pillage and ransoming prisoners was also important for the mounted knight war could be a relatively low risk affair
as central governments grew in power a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began as central levies of the  began to be the central recruiting tool  was one of the most centralized states in the middle ages and the armies that fought in the  were predominantly composed of paid professionals
in theory every englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days forty days was not long enough for a campaign especially one on the continent
thus the  was introduced whereby most englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army however almost all high medieval armies in europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops and there was a large  market in europe from at least the early 12th century
as the middle ages progressed in  italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region these would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers especially in combination with standing forces but in italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states this made them considerably less reliable than a standing army mercenary on mercenary warfare in italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles
in 1439 the  legislature known as the    états généraux passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone there was a new tax to be raised known as the  that was to provide funding for a new royal army the mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the royal army as  on a permanent basis or being hunted down and destroyed if they used france gained a total standing army of around 6000 men which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own the new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors the orms of the 1440s  eventually led to the  in 1453 and the conclusion of the  by 1450 the companies were divided into  the field army known as the grande ordonnance  and the garrison force known as the petite ordonnance vale mga 1992 charles vii berkeley university of california press 
first s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces so they tended to hire  to serve in their armies during wartime such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict when men at arms were no longer needed by their respective governments
the  soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment often becoming mercenaries free companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia
as late as the 1650s most troops were mercenaries however after the 17th century most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops for a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators but soon these tasks were also taken by the state the massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators
the newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state the combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across europe such as the  in france and the 
in many countries the resolution of this conflict was the rise of  only in england and the netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative from the late 17th century states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions the first state to master this process was the  this transformation in the armies of europe had great social impact the defense of the state now rested on the commoners not on the aristocrats
however aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies including their high command moreover popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes the new armies because of their vast expense were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society the great commercial powers of the dutch and english matched much larger states in military might
as any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket it became far easier to form massive armies the inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers this led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies for the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat rather than just the highly skilled professionals
it has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism and during this period the modern notion of the  was born however this would only become apparent after the  at this time the  and  would become the defining paradigm of 
before then however most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities in spain armies were recruited from all the spanish european territories including spain italy   and germany the french recruited some soldiers from germany switzerland as well as from  britain recruited  and  troops until the late 18th century irish catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many catholic european states

in developed nations the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better trained fighting forces the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations as well as memories of the contentiousness of the vietnam war experience make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future

western armies are usually subdivided as follows
 a corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a 
 each division is commanded by a  and usually holds three brigades including infantry artillery engineers and communications units in addition to  supply and service support to sustain independent action except for the divisions operating in the mountains divisions have at least one armored unit some have even more depending upon their functionality the basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division
 a brigade is under the command of a  or sometimes is commanded by a  and comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality an independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit an infantry unit an armour unit and logistics to support its actions such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps
 each battalion is commanded by a  or sometimes by  who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers this number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment a battalion comprises 3–5  3 rifle companies a fire support company and headquarters company or its functional equivalent such as batteries artillery or squadrons armour and cavalry each under the command of a  the company can be divided into platoons each of which can again be divided into sections or squads terminology is nationality and even unit specific name definitions 
a  is composed of a headquarters army  a variable number of  typically between three to four and a variable number of  also between three to four a battle is influenced at the field army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general

the lineage including alligators proper  occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the  in europe where they did not die out until the  age the true alligators are today represented by two species  in the  which can grow to 15ampnbspft 46ampnbspm and weigh 1000ampnbsplbs 453ampnbspkghttp  animalsnationalgeographiccom animals reptiles american alligator source a to z american alligator animalsnationalgeographiccom national geographic society  and the small  in the   which grows to an average of 5ampnbspft 15ampnbspm their name derives from the  el lagarto which means the lizard
in  and  the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily  which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony s each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture besides the three species in  there are the smooth fronted caimans in genus  and the black caiman in  caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile like in their movements and have longer sharper teeth than alligators name guggisberg 
c crocodilus the  has the widest distribution from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina and grows to a modest size of about 22 m 7 ft the largest is the  melanosuchus niger the jacare assu or large or  of the  basin black caimans grow to 165 ft 5 m with the largest recorded size 579ampnbspm 19ampnbspft the black caiman and  are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the  family
although caimans have not been studied in depth scientists have learned their mating cycles previously thought to be spontaneous or year round are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels which increases chances of survival for their offspring
s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads with more obtuse snouts in having the fourth enlarged tooth of the under jaw received not into an external notch but into a pit formed for it within the upper one in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the  in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips and an intolerance to salinity alligators strongly perring fresh water while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt in general crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and american alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat
