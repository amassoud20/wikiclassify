during this time the alcotts had another child born on june 24 1835 she was named  in honor of the teaching assistant at the temple school  by age three however her mother changed her name to elizabeth sewall alcott after her own mother

the temple school was widely denounced in the press reverend  was one of alcotts few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from boston periodicals  alcott was rejected by most public opinion and by the summer of 1837 he had only 11 students left and no assistant after margaret fuller moved to   the controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and as the school closed alcott became increasingly financially desperate remaining steadfast to his pedagogy a forerunner of  and ing he alienated parents in a later parlor school by admitting an  child to the class whom he then used to expel in the face of protests
beginning in 1836 alcotts membership in the  put him in such company as   and buell lawrence emerson cambridge massachusetts the belknap press of harvard university press 2003 32–33 isbn 0 674 01139 2  he became a member with the clubs second meeting and hosted their third name gura89  a biographer of emerson described the group as the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers agreeing in nothing but their liberality name gura5   wrote of the groups nature there was no club in the strict sense only occasional meetings of like minded men and women name gura5  alcott perred the term symposium for their group 
in late april 1840 alcott moved to the town of  name packer115  urged by emerson he rented a home for 50 a year within walking distance of  he named it dove cottage  though they also called it concordia cottage  a supporter of alcotts philosophies emerson offered to help with his writing which proved a difficult task after several revisions for example he deemed the essay psyche alcotts account of how he educated his daughters unpublishable name reisen35  alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of german writer  which were eventually published in the transcendentalists journal  emerson wrote to margaret fuller then editor that they might pass muster amp even pass for just amp great name packer115  he was wrong alcotts so called  sayings were widely mocked for being silly and unintelligible fuller herself disliked them but did not want to hurt alcotts feelings name packer116  in the first issue for example he wrote

with financial support from emerson name schreiner95  alcott left concord on may 8 1842 to a visit to england leaving his brother junius with his family  he met two admirers  and henry c wright  the two men were leaders of  an experimental school based on alcotts methods from the temple school located about ten miles outside   name schreiner95  the schools founder james pierpont greaves had only recently died but alcott was invited to stay there for a week  alcott persuaded them to come to the united states with him lane and his son moved into the alcott house and helped with family chores  persuaded in part by lanes  alcott took a stand against the  administrations plan to annex  as a slave territory and  his  abby may wrote in her journal on january 17 1843 a day of some excitement as mr alcott used to pay his town tax after waiting some time to be committed to jail he was told it was paid by a friend thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles  the annual poll tax was only 150  the incident inspired  whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay   around this time the alcott family set up a sort of domestic post office to curb potential domestic tension abby may described her idea i thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children indeed all of us to interchange thought and sentiment 
lane and alcott collaborated on a major expansion of their educational theories into a n society alcott however was still in debt and could not purchase the land needed for their planned community in a letter lane wrote i do not see anyone to act the money part but myself  in may 1843 he purchased a  farm in  name packer148  up front he paid 1500 of the total 1800 value of the property the rest was meant to be paid by the alcotts over a two year period  they moved to the farm on june 1 and optimistically named it fruitlands despite only ten old apple trees on the property name packer148  in july alcott announced their plans in the dial we have made an arrangement with the proprieter of an estate of about a hundred acres which liberates this tract from human ownership name packer148 
their goal was to regain access to  by finding the correct formula for perfect living following specific rules governing agriculture diet and reproduction  in order to achieve this they removed themselves from the economy as much as possible and lived independently  unlike a similar project named  the participants at fruitlands avoided interaction with local communities  calling themselves a consociate family they agreed to follow a strict vegetarian diet and to till the land without the use of animal labor name packer148  after some difficulty they relented and allowed some cattle to be enslaved name felton132  they also banned coffee tea alcoholic drinks milk and warm bathwater  they only ate aspiring vegetables — those which grew upward — and used those that grew downward like potatoes as alcott had published earlier our wine is water — flesh bread — drugs fruits  for clothing they prohibited leather because animals were killed for it as well as cotton silk and wool because they were products of slave labor name felton132  alcott had high expectations but was often away when the community most needed him as he attempted to recruit more members 
the experimental community was never successful partly because most of the land was not delano sterling f brook farm the dark side of utopia cambridge massachusetts the belknap press of harvard university press 2004 118 isbn 0 674 01160 0  alcott lamented none of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed so we fell apart  its founders were often away as well in the middle of harvesting they left for a lecture tour through  new york city and   in its seven months only 13 people joined included the alcotts and lanes  other than abby may and her daughters only one other woman joined ann page one rumor is that page was asked to leave after eating a fish tail with a neighbor  lane believed alcott had misled him into thinking enough people would join the enterprise and developed a strong dislike for the  he quit the project and moved to a nearby  family with his son  after lanes departure alcott fell into a depression and could not speak or eat for three days  abby may thought lane purposely sabotaged her family she wrote to her brother all mr lanes efforts have been to disunite us but mr alcotts paternal instincts were too strong for him name matteson161  when the final payment on the farm was owed sam may used to cover his brother in laws debts as he often did possibly at abby mays suggestion  the experiment failed the alcotts had to leave fruitlands
the members of the alcott family were not happy with their fruitlands experience at one point abby may threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere leaving bronson behind  louisa may alcott who was ten years old at the time later wrote of the experience in transcendental wild oats 1873 the band of brothers began by spading garden and field but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly 
in january 1844 alcott moved his family to still river a village within harvardehrlich eugene and carruth gorton the oxford illustrated literary guide to the united states new york oxford university press 1982 62 isbn 0 19 503186 5  but on march 1 1845 the family returned to concord to live in a home they named the hillside later renamed  by   both emerson and sam may assisted in securing the home for the alcotts name bedell234  while living in the home louisa began writing in earnest and was given her own room  she later said her years at the home were the happiest years of her life many of the incidents in her novel  1868 are based on this period  alcott renovated the property moving a barn and painting the home a rusty olive color as well as tending to over six acres of land  on may 23 1845 abby may was granted a sum from her fathers estate which was put into a trust fund granting minor financial security name bedell234  that summer bronson alcott let  borrow his ax to prepare his home at  
the alcotts hosted a steady stream of visitors at the hillside  including fugitive slaves which they hosted in secret as a station of the   alcotts opposition to slavery also fueled his opposition to the  which began in 1846 he considered the war a blatant attempt to extend slavery and asked if the country was made up of a people bent on conquest on getting the golden treasures of mexico into our hands and of subjugating foreign peoples 
in 1848 abby may insisted they leave concord which she called cold heartless brainless soulless the alcott family put the hillside up for rent and moved to boston  there next door to peabodys book store on west street bronson alcott hosted a series based on the conversations model by margaret fuller called a course on the conversations on man — his history resources and expectations participants both men and women were charged three dollars to attend or five dollars for all seven lectures  in march 1853 alcott was invited to teach fifteen students at  in an extracurricular non credit course name bedell319 
alcott and his family moved back to concord after 1857 where he and his family lived in the  until 1877 in 1860 alcott was named superintendent of concord schools 
alcott voted in a presidential election for the first time in 1860 in his journal for november 6 1860 he wrote at town house and cast my vote for  and the republican candidates generally — the first vote i ever cast for a president and state officers  alcott was an abolitionist and a friend of the more radical william lloyd garrison  he had attended a rally led by  on behalf of 17 year old  a fugitive slave on trial in boston alcott was one of several who attempted to storm the courthouse when gunshots were heard he was the only one who stood his ground though the effort was unsuccessful  he had also stood his ground in a protest against the trial of  a group had broken down the door of the boston courthouse but guards beat them back alcott stood forward and asked the leader of the group  why are we not within he then walked calmly into the courthouse was threatened with a gun and turned back but without hastening a step according to higginson 
in 1862 louisa moved to  to volunteer as a nurse on january 14 1863 the alcotts received a telegram that louisa was sick bronson immediately went to bring her home briefly meeting abraham lincoln while there  louisa turned her experience into the book  her father wrote of it i see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of louisas merits as a woman and a writer 
henry david thoreau died on may 6 1862 name schreiner216  likely from an illness he caught from alcott two years earlier  
at emersons request alcott helped arrange thoreaus funeral which was held at first parish sanctuary in concord  despite thoreau having disavowed membership in the church when he was in his early twenties  emerson wrote a eulogy  and alcott helped plan the preparations name schreiner216  only two years later neighbor nathaniel hawthorne died as well alcott served as a pallbearer along with     and others  with hawthornes death alcott worried that few of the concord notables remained he recorded in his journal fair figures one by one are fading from sight  the next year lincoln was assassinated which alcott called appalling news 
in 1868 alcott met with publisher thomas niles an admirer of hospital sketches alcott asked niles if he would publish a book of short stories by his daughter instead he suggested she write a book about girls louisa may was not interested initially but agreed to trymadison charles a irving to irving author publisher relations 1800–1974 new york r r bowker company 1974 36 isbn 0 8352 0772 2  they want a book of 200 pages or more alcott told his daughter  the result was little women published later that year the book which fictionalized the alcott family during the girls coming of age years recast the father figure as a soldier away from home while he fought in the 
alcott spoke as opportunity arose before the s then common in various parts of the united states or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him these conversations as he called them were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics spiritual aesthetic and practical in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of american transcendentalists led by emerson who was always his supporter and discreet admirer he often discussed platonic philosophy the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with spirit upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life
alcotts published books all from late in his life include tablets 1868 concord days 1872 new connecticut 1881 and sonnets and canzonets 1882 louisa may attended to her fathers needs in his final years she purchased a house for her sister anna which had been the last home of henry david thoreau now known as the ehrlich eugene and gorton carruth the oxford illustrated literary guide to the united states new york oxford university press 1982 45 isbn 0 19 503186 5  louisa and her parents moved in with anna as well 
after the death of his wife abby may on november 25 1877 alcott never returned to orchard house too heartbroken to live there he and louisa may collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers letters and journals my heart bleeds with the memories of those days he wrote and even long years of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence  louisa noted her father had become restless with his anchor gone  they gave up on the memoir project and louisa burned many of her mothers papers 
on january 19 1879 alcott and  wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country  the result was the  and literature which held its first session in 1879 in alcotts study in the  in 1880 the school moved to the hillside chapel a building next to the house where he held conversations and over the course of successive summers as he entered his eighties invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy religion and letters  the school considered one of the first formal adult education centers in america was also attended by foreign scholars it continued for nine years
in april 1882 alcotts friend and benefactor ralph waldo emerson was sick and bedridden after visiting him alcott wrote concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud emerson died the next day  alcott himself moved out of concord for his final years settling at 10 louisburg square in boston beginning in 1885wilson susan the literary trail of greater boston beverly massachusetts commonwealth editions 2005 57 isbn 1 889833 67 3 
as he was bedridden at the end of his life alcotts daughter louisa may came to visit him at louisburg on march 1 1888 he said to her i am going up come with me she responded i wish i could  he died three days later on march 4 louisa may died only two days after her father
alcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to  as a means of disciplining his students instead beginning at the temple school he would appoint a daily student superintendent when that student observed an infraction he or she reported it to the rest of the class and as a whole they deliberated on punishment  at times alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike saying that any failing was the teachers responsibility the shame and guilt this method induced he believed was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment when he used physical correction he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application even including the student to be punished
the most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay observations on the principles and methods of infant instruction alcott believed that early education must draw out unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment  he noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a lective state of mind 
alcotts ideas as an educator were controversial writer  for example wrote dubiously that the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth and that his business is to bring it out into expression  even so his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in america and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education many of alcotts educational principles are still used in classrooms today including teach by encouragement art education music education acting exercises learning through experience risk taking in the classroom tolerance in schools physical education recess and early childhood education the teachings of william ellery channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the concord transcendentalists
the concord school of philosophy which closed following alcotts death in 1888 was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s it has continued functioning with a summer conversational series in its original building at orchard house now run by the louisa may alcott memorial association
while many of alcotts ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal radical edge they are still common themes in society including vegetarian  sustainable living and temperance self control alcott described his sustenance as a pythagorean diet meat eggs butter cheese and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water  alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well being to mental improvement he further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and in a sense predicted modern  by condemning  and encouraging humankinds role in sustaining ecology 
alcotts philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent hazy or abrupt he formulated no system of philosophy and shows the influence of  german  and  as filtered through the writings of  margaret fuller erred to alcott as a philosopher of the balmy times of —a man whom the worldlings of boston hold in as much horror as the worldlings of athens held nelson randy f editor the almanac of american letters los altos california william kaufmann inc 1981 152 isbn 0 86576 008 x  in his later years alcott related a story from his boyhood during a total  he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder he lected that the event was a prophecy that he would be tilting at the sun and always catching the fall 
like emerson alcott was always optimistic idealistic and individualistic in thinking writer  erred to alcott in his poem studies for two heads as an angel with clipped wings name bedell319  even so emerson noted that alcotts brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing when he sits down to write emerson wrote all his genius leaves him he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought name reisen35  his orphic sayings published in the dial became famous for their hilarity as dense pretentious and meaningless in new york for example  published a parody titled gastric sayings in november 1840 a writer for the boston post erred to alcotts orphic sayings as a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger name packer116 
modern critics often fault alcott for not being able to financially support his family alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man once writing to his mother that he was still at my old trade—hoping  alcott held his principles above his well being shortly before his marriage for example his future father in law colonel joseph may helped him find a job teaching at a school in boston run by the society of free enquirers followers of  for a lucrative 1000 to 1200 annual salary he used it because he did not agree with their beliefs writing i shall have nothing to do with them 
from the other perspective alcotts unique teaching ideas created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers

arachnophobia or arachnephobiapatricia bowen ed internal medicine words rayve productions 1997 p 18  from the   spider and   fear is a  the fear of s and other s such as sheather hatfield http  wwwwebmdcom anxiety panic guide fear factor phobias the fear factor phobias webmdcom 
people with arachnophobia tend to feel  in any area they believe could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence such as  if arachnophobics see a spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the  that is often associated with their phobia some people   jump from moving cars experience trouble breathing  or even heart palpitations when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs in some extreme cases even a  or a realistic drawing of a spider can also trigger fear
an  for the phobias remains unresolved one view especially held in  is that the presence of  led to the evolution of a fear of spiders or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy like all traits there is variability in the intensity of fears of spiders and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic spiders for instance being relatively small do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the  where size is a factor but can be 
by ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments giving them a slight advantage over non arachnophobes in terms of survival however having a disproportional fear of spiders in comparison to the other potentially dangerous creatures  that were present during homo sapiens  may have had drawbacks
arachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an ive response that helped early humans to survive  or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly european societies 
studies with  have shown that a fear of spiders can develop before birth 
the alternative view is that the dangers such as from spiders are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution instead inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival rather than being an aid for some communities such as in  and  except       and  spiders are included in traditional foods this suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural rather than genetic trait  
the  of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias
the first line of treatment is ampnbsp– also known as ampnbsp– which was first described by south african psychiatrist   in addition   and  are used in the treatment of phobias 
before engaging in systematic desensitization it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques which will help keep the patient calm systematic desensitization can be done in vivo with live spiders or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders this technique can be effective in just one session  the discovery of the implication of n methyl d aspartate in fear and fear extinction  has led to the use of d —originally developed as an antibiotic—to augment the results of therapy 
recent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy these techniques have proven to be effective

alabaster is a name applied to varieties of two distinct s when used as a material  a   of  and  a  of calcium also known as onyx marble egyptian alabaster or oriental alabaster in geological terms alabaster is a   marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and browngrove r w sanderson and francis cheetham alabaster  oxford art online oxford university press accessed march 13 2013 http  wwwoxfordartonlinecom subscriber article grove art t001400 subscriber link  in general but not always ancient alabaster in egypt and the near amp middle east is calcite alabaster in medieval europe is gypsum modern alabaster is probably calcite but may be either both are easy to work and as both are slightly water soluble have been used for making a variety of indoor artworks and carvings as they will not survive long outdoors
the two kinds are readily distinguished from each other by differences in their relative hardness the gypsum kind is so soft as to be readily scratched with a fingernail  15 to 2 while the calcite kind is too hard to be scratched in this way mohs hardness 3 although it does yield readily to a knife moreover the calcite alabaster being a   upon being touched with  whereas the gypsum alabaster when thus treated remains practically unaffected
the characteristic color of white alabaster has lent its name as a common description of  things particularly alabaster skin which means very light and quite translucent and possibly derives from the use of alabaster for tomb effigies
the origin of the word alabaster is in middle english through old french alabastre in turn derived from the  alabaster and that from  ἀλάβαστρος alabastros or ἀλάβαστος alabastos the latter was a term used to identify a vase made of alabasterhttp  wwwperseustuftsedu cgi bin ptextdoc perseus%3atext%3a1999040057%3aentry%3d%233809 alabastos henry george liddell robert scott a greek english lexicon at perseus

this substance the alabaster of the  and  often is termed oriental alabaster since the early examples came from the  the  name alabastrites is said to be derived from the town of alabastron in  where the stone was quarried  the locality probably owed its name to the mineral the origin of the mineral name is obscure though see above
the oriental alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called  the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name in egypt craftsmen used alabaster for s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects a  sculptured in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from alabastron is in the   this was discovered by  in 1817 in the tomb of  near  it was purchased by sir

calcite alabaster is found as either a  deposit from the floor and walls of  s or as a kind of  similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross section from which it derives its name onyx marble or alabaster onyx or sometimes simply as   the latter term should be restricted to siliceous minerals however
egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near  and  many ancient quarries are found in the hills overlooking the plain of

gypsum alabaster is a common mineral which occurs in england in the  s of the  especially at  in  at fauld in  and near  in  deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively in the 14th and 15th centuries its carving into small statues and sets of  panels for s was a valuable  as well as a major english export these were usually painted or partly painted it was also used for the effigies often life size on s as the typical recumbent position suited the materials lack of strength and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble besides examples of these carvings still in britain especially at the   and  trade in mineral alabaster rather than just the antiques trade has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the  spain and scandinavia
much of the world’s alabaster extraction is performed in the centre of the  in   elsewhere it has either been depleted or its extraction is so difficult that it has almost been abandoned or is carried out at a very high cost  has the privilege of having the largest known exploitable deposits there are two different sites which are geographically separated though both are located in tertiary basins the most important one corresponds to the fuentes azaila area in the tertiary ebro basin the other area where this resource is present is the calatayud teruel basin which divides the iberian range in two main sectors nw and se the abundance of aragonese alabaster must have been crucial for its use in architecture sculpture and decoration there is no record of likely use by preroman cultures so perhaps the first ones to use alabaster in  were the romans who produced vessels with alabaster following the greek and egyptian models it seems that since the reconstruction of the roman wall in  in the 3rd century ad with alabaster the use of this material became common in building for centuries muslim saraqusta today  was also called medina albaida the white city due to the appearance of its alabaster walls and palaces which stood out among gardens groves and orchards by the ebro and huerva rivers the oldest remains in the  palace together with other interesting elements like capitals reliefs and inscriptions were made using alabaster but it was during the artistic and economic blossoming of the renaissance that aragonese alabaster reached its golden age in the 16th century sculptors in  chose alabaster for their best works they were adept at exploiting its lighting qualities and generally speaking the finished art pieces retained their natural color  
alabaster also is found although in smaller quantity at  in  near  in  and elsewhere in  it occurs largely in the new red rocks but at a lower geological horizon the alabaster of nottinghamshire and derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or floors in spheroidal masses known as balls or bowls and in smaller lenticular masses termed cakes at chellaston where the local alabaster is known as patrick it has been worked into ornaments under the name of derbyshire spar—a term more properly applied to 
in  the centre of the alabaster trade today is   alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone interstratified with s of  and  age the mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries in the district of  several varieties are recognized—veined spotted clouded agatiform and others the finest kind obtained principally from  is sent to florence for figure sculpture while the common kinds are carved locally into vases lights and various ornamental objects these items are objects of extensive trade especially in florence  and  spain and many other countries have deposits which have been worked
black alabaster is a rare anhydrite form of the gypsum based mineral this black form is found in only three veins in the world one each in   and 
 near  is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster there are several types of alabaster found at the site including pink white and the rare black alabaster

the finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an  especially for  decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls its softness enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work if alabaster with a smooth polished surface is washed with  it will become rough dull and whiter losing most of its translucency and lustre
the purest alabaster is a snow white material of fine uniform grain but it often is associated with an oxide of  which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone the coarser varieties of alabaster are converted by calcination into  whence they sometimes are known as plaster stone
in order to diminish the  of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually—nearly to the boiling point—an operation requiring great care for if the temperature is not regulated caully the stone acquires a dead white chalky appearance the effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum if properly treated it very closely resembles true marble and is known as marmo di castellina
sulphate of lime gypsum also was used by the ancients it was employed for instance in assyrian sculpture so some of the ancient alabaster is identical to the modern stone
alabaster may be stained to disguise it by being heated in various pigmentary solutions in this way a very misleading imitation of  that is called alabaster coral is produced

the existence of ahab is historically supported also outside of the biblical stories  documented 853 bc that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the  one of these was ahab

 ahabs father and founder of the short lived omri dynasty seems to have been a successful military leader he is reported in the text of the moabite  to have oppressed moab for many days  during ahabs reign  which had been conquered by his father remained tributary while  with whose king  he was allied by marriage only with  is he believed to have had strained relations
ahab married  the daughter of the king of tyre 1 kings 16–22 tells the story of ahab and jezebel and indicates that jezebel was a dominant influence on ahab and strove to spread idol worship of  in israel 1631 184–19 191–2 215–25  ahab was succeeded by  and  who reigned over israel until jehus revolt of 842 bcmichael d coogan a brief introduction to the old testament oxford oxford university press 2009239

in the biblical text ahab has five important encounters with prophets 
the first encounter is with  whom ahab ers to as the troubler of israel 1 kings 1817 in which elijah predicts a drought 1 kings 171 this encounter ends with elijah victorious over the official  prophets of israel in a contest held for the sake of the israelites and their king ahab the contest ends when elijahs god consumes the offering which the baal worshipers could not induce their god to touch after which elijah slaughters the baal prophets 1 kings 1817–40 the second encounter is between ahab and an unnamed prophet in 1 kings 2022 the third is again between ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns ahab for his actions in a battle that had just taken place 1 kings 2034 43 the fourth is when elijah confronts ahab over ahabs and jezebels execution of  and usurpation of the latters ancestral vineyard 1 kings 211 16 upon the prophets remonstration hast thou killed and also taken possession 1 kings 2119 ahab displayed sincere remorse 1 kings 2127 the fifth encounter is with  the prophet who when asked for advice on a military campaign first assures ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives ahab a glimpse into gods plan for ahab to die in battle 1 kings 22achtemeier paul editor the harpercollins bible dictionary new york harpercollins 1996 p 18 
three years later war broke out east of the  and ahab with jehoshaphat of judah went to recover   during this battle ahab disguised himself but was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow 1 kings 22 the hebrew bible says that dogs licked his blood according to the prophecy of elijah but the septuagint the greek translation of the old testament adds that pigs also licked his blood symbolically making him unclean to the israelites who abstained from pork ahab was succeeded by his sons  and 
jezebels death however was more dramatic than ahabs as recorded in 2 kings 930 34 jezebel was confronted by jehu who had her servants  causing her death
essentially 1 kings 1629 through 2240 is the story of ahabs reign this reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of  throughout as well as various consequences because of his marriage to jezebel because of his worship of baal disobedience to prophetic warnings and words and also because of the murder of naboth the murder of  see  an act of royal encroachment stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of the israelite prophets including elijah and micaiah indeed he is erred to for this and other things as being more evil than all the kings before him 1 kings 1630 the followers of yahweh found their champion in elijah his denunciation of the royal dynasty of israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of yahweh and yahweh alone illustrated by the contest between yahweh and baal on  1 kings 18 form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of  an event in which elijahs chosen disciple  was the leading figure

algol betaampnbspper βampnbsppersei βampnbspper known colloquially as the demon star is a bright  in the    it is one of the best known  the first such star to be discovered and also one of the first non  s  to be discovered algol is actually a three star system beta perseiampnbspaa1 aa2 andampnbspab in which the large and bright primary β perseiampnbspaa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer β perseiampnbspaa2 thus algols  is usually near constant atampnbsp21 but regularly dips to 34 every 286 days 2 days 20ampnbsphours and 49ampnbspminutes during the roughly 10 hour long partial eclipses there is also a secondary eclipse the second minimum when the brighter star  the fainter secondary this secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically
  algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable known as s
an ancient egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days composed some 3200 years ago is the oldest historical document of the discovery of 
algol  
 
the association of algol with a demon like creature  in the greek tradition  in the arabic tradition suggests that its variability was known long before the 17th century  but except for the ancient egyptian discovery there is still no indisputable evidence for thisgaampnbspdavis why did the arabs call beta persei al ghul sky and telescope 16 1957 177 http  adsabsharvardedu abs 1957s%26t16177d ads  
the variability of algol was rediscovered in 1667 by italian astronomer gampnbspmontanari sopra la sparizione dalcune stelle et altre novità celesti in prose de signori accademici gelati di bologna bologna manolessi 1671 ppampnbsp369 92 http  booksgooglecom booksid tfglf4 bsqec google books  but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than a century later when the british amateur astronomer  also proposed a mechanism for the stars variabilityhttp  adsabsharvardedu abs 1957obs77191e ads ojampnbspeggenan eighteenth century discussion of algol the observatory 77 1957 191 197  in may 1783 he presented his findings to the  suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star or else that the star itself has a darker region that is periodically turned toward the earth for his report he was awarded the  
in 1881 the harvard astronomer  presented evidence that algol was actually an eclipsing binary  this was confirmed a few years later in 1889 when the potsdam astronomer  found periodic s in the spectrum of algol inferring variations in the  of this binary system  thus algol became one of the first known  dr  at the  used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first ever photoelectric study of a variable star the light curve revealed the second minimum and the lection effect between the two stars 
some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system four decades later this conjecture was found to be correctmeltzer alan s a spectroscopic investigation of algol astrophysical journal vol 125 1957 p359 http  adsabsharvardedu abs 1957apj125359m bibcode1957apj125359m 
from the point of view of the earth algolampnbspaa1 and algolampnbspaa2 form an  because their  contains the   to the earth to be more precise algol is a triple star system the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only 0062ampnbsps au from each other whereas the third star in the system algolampnbspab is at an average distance of 269ampnbspau from the pair and the mutual  of the trio is 681ampnbspearth days the total mass of the system is about 58 solar masses and the mass ratios of aa1 aa2 and ab are about 45 to 1 to 2
the three components of the bright triple star used to be and still sometimes are erred to as β per a b and c  the  lists them as aa1 aa2 and an with two very faint stars b and c about one  distant  a further five faint stars are also listed as companions name wds 
studies of algol led to the  in the theory of  although components of a binary star form at the same time and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive ones it was observed that the more massive component algolampnbspa is still in the  whereas the less massive algolampnbspb is a  at a later evolutionary stage the paradox can be solved by  when the more massive star became a subgiant it filled its  and most of the mass was transferred to the other star which is still in the main sequence in some binaries similar to algol a gas flow can be seen 
this system also exhibits variable activities in the forms of  and  flares the former is thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the a and b components interacting with the mass transfer  the radio wave emissions might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of s but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the  these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent 
magnetic activity cycles in the chromospherically active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to recurrent orbital period variations on the order of ∆p pampnbsp≈ampnbsp10sup−5 sup via the  name applegate 1992   between the components is small in the algol system  but could be a significant source of period change in other

    redirects here so this article deals with both anno domini and before christ   
the term anno domini is  which means in the year of the lord  but is often translated as in the year of our lord  since ad stands for anno domini in the year of our lord  it is occasionally set out more fully as anno domini nostri iesu or jesu christi in the year of our lord jesus christ the terms    ad or ad and before christthe word before is often capitalized but this is considered incorrect by many authorities and either not mentioned in major dictionaries or only listed as an alternative wikipedias manual of style also prescribes lowercase     bc or bc are used to label or number years in the  and s
this  is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the  or  of  with ad counting years from the start of this  and bc denoting years before the start of the era there is no  in this scheme so the year adampnbsp1 immediately follows the year 1ampnbspbc this dating system was devised in 525 but was not widely used until after 800 name teresi1997
 
the gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today for decades it has been the unofficial global standard adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication transportation and commercial integration and recognized by international institutions such as the  
traditionally  followed  usage by placing the ad abbreviation before the year number however bc is placed after the year number for example adampnbsp but 68ampnbspbc which also preserves syntactic order the abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a  or  as in fourth century ad or second millennium ad although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressionschicago manual of style 1993 p 304  because bc is the english abbreviation for before christ it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that ad means after death ie after the death of jesus however this would mean that the ~33 years commonly associated with the life of jesus would not be included in either of the bc and the ad time scalesdonald p ryan 2000 15 
terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non christian people is to call this the current or  abbreviated as ce or ce with the preceding years erred to as before the common christian or current era bce or bce  and  avoid words or abbreviations related to christianity but use the same numbers for ad years
the anno domini dating system was devised in 525 by  to enumerate the years in his  his system was to replace the  that had been used in an old  because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who blackburn amp holford strevens 2003 767  the last year of the old table diocletian 247 was immediately followed by the first year of his table ad 532 when he devised his table  years were identified by naming the s who held office that year—he himself stated that the present year was the consulship of  which was 525 years since the incarnation of our lord jesus christhttp  hbarphysmsuru gorm chrono paschatahtm nineteen year cycle of dionysius introduction and first argumentum  thus dionysius implied that jesus incarnation occurred 525 years earlier without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred however nowhere in his exposition of his table does dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system whether consulate  year of the world or  of augustus much less does he explain or justify the underlying date name bhs 
blackburn amp holford strevens briefly present arguments for 2 bc 1 bc or ad 1 as the year dionysius intended for the  or  among the sources of confusion are name bhs 
 in modern times incarnation is synonymous with the conception but some ancient writers such as  considered incarnation to be synonymous with the nativity
 the civil or consular year began on  but the diocletian year began on 29 august 30 august in the year before a julian leap year
 there were inaccuracies in the list of consuls
 there were confused summations of emperors regnal years
it is not known how dionysius established the year of jesuss birth two major theories are that dionysius based his calculation on the gospel of luke which states that jesus was about thirty years old shortly after the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar and hence subtracted thirty years from that date or that dionysius counted back 532 years the period during which the dates of alexandrian easter repeat from the first year of his new tabletøndering claus http  wwwtonderingdk claus cal yearsphp the calendar faq counting years 
it has also been speculated by georges declercqdeclercq georges anno domini the origins of the christian era turnhout belgium 2000  that dionysius desire to replace diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent  at the time it was believed by some that the  and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of jesus the old  calendar theoretically commenced with the  based on information in the  it was believed that based on the anno mundi calendar jesus was born in the year 5500 or 5500 years after the world was created with the year 6000 of the anno mundi calendar marking the end of the worldwallraff martin julius africanus und die christliche weltchronik walter de gruyter 2006 mosshammer alden a the easter computus and the origins of the christian era oxford university press 2009 p 254 p 270 p 328  anno mundi 6000 approximately ad 500 was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the worlddeclercq georges anno domini the origins of the christian era turnhout belgium 2000  but this date had already passed in the time of dionysius
the  historian the venerable bede who was familiar with the work of dionysius exiguus used anno domini dating in his  completed in 731 in this same history he also used another  term ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo in fact in the 60th year before the time of the lords incarnation equivalent to the english before christ to identify years before the first year of this erabede 731 book 1 chapter 2 first sentence   both dionysius and bede regarded anno domini as beginning at the incarnation of jesus but the distinction between incarnation and nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century when in some places the incarnation epoch was identified with christs conception ie the annunciation on march 25 annunciation style name bhs 
on the continent of  anno domini was introduced as the era of choice of the  by  its endorsement by emperor  and  popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the  ultimately lies at the core of the systems prevalence according to the  s continued to date documents according to  for some time but usage of ad gradually became more common in  countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries name cathencygerard 1908  in 1422  became the last an country to  the system begun by dionysius name cathency chron 
 
 countries only began to adopt ad instead of the  in 1700 when  did so with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries
although anno domini was in widespread use by the 9th century the term before christ or its equivalent did not become common until much later bede the venerable used the expression anno igitur ante incarnationem dominicam so in the year before the incarnation of the lord twice anno an xpi nativitate in the year before the birth of christ is found in 1474 in a work by a german monk in http  wwwcervantesvirtualcom servlet sirveobras 80248064097793506388868 indexhtm fasciculus temporum 1474 used anno an xpi nativitatem in the th year before the birth of christ for all years between  and  xpi is the  χρι in latin letters which is an abbreviation for christi this phrase appears upside down in the centre of  right hand pages from jesus to  he usually used anno christi or its abbreviated form anno xpi on  folios—left hand pages he used anno mundi alongside all of these terms for all years  in 1627 the french    dionysius petavius in latin with his work de doctrina temporum popularized the usage ante christum latin for before christ to mark years prior to ad
 
 
 
when the reckoning from jesus incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western europe various people chose different christian feast days to begin the year   or  thus depending on the time and place the year number changed on different days in the year which created slightly different styles in chronologyhttp  catdirlocgov catdir samples cam032 99027383pdf  a handbook of dates for students of british history cambridge university press 1945–2000 pp 8–14

 from 25 december 753 auc today in 1 bc ie notionally from the birth of jesus it was called nativity style and had been spread by  together with the anno domini in the early middle ages that reckoning of the year of grace from christmas was used in france england and most of western europe except spain until the 12th century when it was replaced by annunciation style and in germany until the second quarter of the 13th century
 from 25 march 754 auc today in ad 1 that second annunciation style may have originated in  in the early 11th century but it was spread by the cistercians  adopted that style in opposition to that of pisa so it got the name of calculus florentinus it soon spread in france and also in england where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752

alternative names for the anno domini era include vulgaris aerae found 1615 in latin name vulgarisaerae1

since 1856
the term common era does not appear in this book the term christian era lowercase does appear a number of times nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly
 
the alternative abbreviations  sometimes written ce and bce are sometimes used in place of ad and bc
the common current era ce terminology is often perred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious erences  
for example cunningham and starr 1998 write that bce ce …do not presuppose faith in  and hence are more appropriate for  than the conventional bc ad name cunningham2004  upon its foundation the  adopted the  but used the western calendar for international purposes the translated term was 西元 xī yuán western era later in 1949 the  adopted 公元 gōngyuán common era for all purposes domestic and foreign
in the ad year numbering system whether applied to the  or s ad 1 is preceded by 1 bc there is no year 0 between them because of this most experts agree that a new century begins in a year which has 01 as the final digits eg 1801 1901 2001 new millennia likewise began in 1001 and 2001 a common misconception is that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes 1800 1900 2000 etc name teresi1997   moreover this convention was widely used to celebrate the new millennium in the year 2000 for computational reasons  and the  standard designate years so that ad 1   year 1 1 bc   year 0 2 bc   year −1 etc in common usage ancient dates are expressed in the julian calendar but iso 8601 uses the gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to bc or ad

alcuin of york  c 735 – 19 may 804 also called ealhwine albinus or flaccus was an english scholar  poet and teacher from   he was born around 735 and became the student of  at york at the invitation of  he became a leading scholar and teacher at the  where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s he wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems he was made abbot of  in 796 where he remained until his death the most learned man anywhere to be found according to s life of charlemagneeinhard life of charlemagne §25  he is considered among the most important architects of the  among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the carolingian era
alcuin was born in  presumably sometime in the 730s virtually nothing is known of his parents family background or origin name bullough alcuin p 164bullough 2003 p 164  in common hagiographical fashion the vita alcuini asserts that alcuin was of noble english stock and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars alcuins own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as wilgils father of the missionary saint  and beornred abbot of echternach and bishop of sens who was more distantly related in his life of st willibrord alcuin writes that wilgils called a paterfamilias had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the  which had fallen into alcuins possession by inheritance because in early anglo latin writing paterfamilias head of a family householder usually erred to a   suggests that alcuins family was of  status ie free but subordinate to a noble lord and that alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracybullough 2003 pp 146–7 165  if so alcuins origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as bullough 2003 p 165 
the young alcuin came to the  of  during the golden age of archbishop  and his brother the northumbrian king  ecgbert had been a disciple of the  who urged him to raise york to an  king eadberht and archbishop ecgbert oversaw the re energising and re organisation of the  with an emphasis on orming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that bede had begun ecgbert was devoted to alcuin who thrived under his tutelage
the york school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts literature and science as well as in religious matters name renewamerica  it was from here that alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the  court he revived the school with the  and  disciplines name burnshttp  wwwnewadventorg cathen 01276ahtm burns james alcuin the catholic encyclopedia vol 1 new york robert appleton company 1907 29 nov 2014  writing a  on the trivium while his student  wrote one on the quadrivium
alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s his ascendancy to the headship of the york school the ancestor of  began after  became archbishop of york in 767 around the same time alcuin became a  in the church he was never ordained as a priest and there is no real evidence that he became an actual monk but he lived his life as one
in 781 king  sent alcuin to rome to petition the pope for official confirmation of yorks status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop  on his way home he met charlemagne whom he had met once before this time in the italian city of  pampnbsp207 charlemagne met alcuin – for the second time – at parma in 781 story 2005 reports that alcuin had previously been sent to charlemagne by ethelbert  
alcuins intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join charlemagnes court he joined an illustrious group of scholars that charlemagne had gathered around him the mainsprings of the    rado and  alcuin would later write that the lord was calling me to the service of king charles
he was welcomed at the  school of charlemagne in  urbs regale in 782 it had been founded by the kings ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children mostly in manners and the ways of the court however charlemagne wanted to include the  and most importantly the study of the religion from 782 to 790 alcuin taught charlemagne himself his sons  and  the young men sent to be educated at court and the young clerics attached to the  bringing with him from york his assistants pyttel sigewulf and joseph alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the palace school introducing charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning to the extent that the institution came to be known as the school of master albinus
in this role as adviser he tackled the emperor over his policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death arguing faith is a free act of the will not a forced act we must appeal to the conscience not compel it by violence you can force people to be baptised but you cannot force them to believe his arguments seem to have prevailed – charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797needham dr nr two thousand years of christs power part two the middle ages grace publications 2000 page 52 
charlemagne was a master at gathering the best men of every land in his court he himself became far more than just the king at the centre it seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors they erred to him as david a erence to the biblical king  alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with charlemagne and the other men at court where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames name wilmot  alcuin himself was known as albinus or flaccus while at  alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils – derived mainly from s stephen jaegar enobling love in search of a lost sensibility university of pennsylvania 1999 
in 790 alcuin returned from the court of charlemagne to england to which he had remained attached he dwelt there for some time but charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the  heresy which was at that time making great progress in  the old capital of the  and still a major city for the christians under  he is believed to have had contacts with  from the  who fought against adoptionism at the  in 794 alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by  an  according to the catholic encyclopaedia name burns  having failed during his stay in northumbria to influence king  in the conduct of his reign alcuin never returned home
he was back at charlemagnes court by at least mid 792 writing a series of letters to Æthelred to hygbald bishop of  and to   in the succeeding months dealing with the  attack on lindisfarne in july 793 these letters and alcuins poem on the subject de clade lindisfarnensis monasterii provide the only significant contemporary account of these events in his description of the viking attack he wrote never before has such terror appeared in britain behold the church of  splattered with the blood of gods priests robbed of its ornaments
in 796 alcuin was in his sixties he hoped to be free from court duties and was given the chance upon the death of abbot itherius of saint martin at tours when charlemagne put  into alcuins care with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel
alcuin died on 19 may 804 some ten years before the emperor and was buried at st martins church under an epitaph that partly read
he was later  as a  and remains recognised within the roman catholic anglican and eastern orthodox traditions
the majority of details on alcuins life come from his letters and poems there are also autobiographical sections in alcuins poem on york and in the vita alcuini a  written for him at ferrières in the 820s possibly based in part on the memories of sigwulf one of alcuins pupils

saint angilbert ampnbsp 18 february 814 sometimes known as angilberk was a noble  poet who was educated under  and served  as a secretary diplomat and son in law he was venerated as a   and is still honored on the day of his death 18 february
angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of charlemagne at the palace school in aquae grani  he was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great english scholar  when charlemagne sent his young son  to italy as king of the  angilbert went along as primicerius palatii a high administrator of the satellite court as the friend and adviser of pepin he assisted for a while in the government of italy angilbert delivered the document on  from the frankish synod of frankfurt to  and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope in 792 794 and 796 at one time he served an officer of the maritime provinces he accompanied charlemagne to rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 814
there are various traditions concerning angilberts relationship with  one holds that they were married another that they were not they had however at least two sons one of whom  became a notable figure in the mid 9th century control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the   bertha and angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices on the other hand some historians have speculated that charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands none of charlemagnes daughters were married despite political offers of arranged marriages
in 790 he retired to the abbey of centulum the monastery of st richarius  at present day  in  elected  in 794 he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of 200 volumes it was not uncommon for the   or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation angilbert in contrast spent a great deal rebuilding saint riquier when he completed it charlemagne spent easter of the year 800 there in keeping with carolingian policies angilbert established a school at saint riquier to educate the local boys
his  poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames charlemagne was erred to as david a erence to the biblical king  angilbert was nicknamed  because he wrote poetry and was the probable author of an  of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii it is a mosaic from    and  composed in the manner of einhards use of suetonius of the shorter poems besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the  796 an epistle to  ie charlemagne incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperors palace the erence to bertha however is distant and respectful her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation
angilberts poems have been published by  in the  for criticisms of this edition see traube in roederers schriften für germanische philologie 1888

compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a  group thus having the structure r–co–nr′r″   has a well known carbonyl group to be written as c o    are called s and have different chemical properties from amines
     redirects to this section   
an aliphatic amine has no  attached directly to the nitrogen atom  s have the nitrogen atom connected to an  ring as in the various s the aromatic ring decreases the  of the amine depending on its substituents the presence of an amine group strongly increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring due to an electron donating effect
amines are organized into four subcategories
primary amines   primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an  or  important primary alkyl amines include   2 aminoethanol and the   while primary aromatic amines include 
secondary amines   secondary amines have two organic substituents alkyl aryl or both bound to n together with one hydrogen or no hydrogen if one of the substituent bonds is double important representatives include  and  while an example of an aromatic amine would be 
tertiary amines   in tertiary amines all three hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic substituents examples include  which has a distinctively fishy smell or 
cyclic amines    amines are either secondary or tertiary amines examples of cyclic amines include the 3 member ring  and the six membered ring  n methylpiperidine and n phenylpiperidine are examples of cyclic tertiary amines
it is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen these species are not amines but are s and have a charged nitrogen center  quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions
amines are named in several ways typically the compound is given the pix amino  or the suffix  amine the pix n  shows substitution on the nitrogen atom an organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine triamine tetraamine and so forth
systematic names for some common amines

  lower amines are named with the suffix  aminebr

methylamine
  higher amines have the pix amino as a functional group iupac however does not recommend this convention but pers the alkanamine form eg pentan 2 amine br

2 aminopentanebror sometimes pent 2 yl amine or pentan 2 amine
 }
 significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines  thus the  of amines is higher than those of the corresponding s but generally lower than those of the corresponding s for example  and  amines are gases under standard conditions whereas the corresponding  and  alcohols are liquids gaseous amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell liquid amines have a distinctive fishy smell
also lecting their ability to form hydrogen bonds most aliphatic amines display some solubility in water solubility decreases with the increase in the number of carbon atoms aliphatic amines display significant solubility in organic s especially polar organic solvents primary amines react with s such as 
the aromatic amines such as  have their lone pair electrons  into the benzene ring thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low

amines of the type nhrr′ and nrr′r″ are  the nitrogen atom bears four substituents counting the lone pair the energy barrier for the inversion of the stereocenter is relatively low eg ~7ampnbsp for a trialkylamine the interconversion of the stereoisomers has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind because of this low barrier amines such as nhrr′ cannot be resolved optically and nrr′r″ can only be resolved when the r r′ and r″ groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as s quaternary ammonium salts with four distinct groups on the nitrogen are capable of exhibiting optical activity
like ammonia amines are  compared to alkali metal hydroxides amines are weaker see table for examples of  ksuba sub values the basicity of amines depends on

 +i effect of  groups raises the energy of the lone pair of electrons thus elevating the basicity thus the basicity of an amine may be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine however there is no strict trend in this regard as basicity is also governed by other factors mentioned above consider the kb values of the methyl amines given above the increase in kb from methylamine to dimethylamine may be attributed to +i effect however there is a decrease from dimethylamine to trimethyl amine due to the predominance of steric hindrance offered by the three methyl groups to the approaching

  m effect of aromatic ring delocalises the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen into the ring resulting in decreased basicity substituents on the aromatic ring and their positions relative to the amine group may also considerably alter basicity as seen above
the solvation of protonated amines changes upon their conversion to ammonium compounds typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water primary ammonium rnhsub3 subsup+ sup  secondary ammonium rsub2 subnhsub2 subsup+ sup  tertiary ammonium rsub3 subnhsup+ sup s usually exhibit the lowest solubility of the series
in sterically hindered amines as in the case of trimethylamine the protonated form is not well solvated for this reason the parent amine is less basic than expected in the case of aprotic polar solvents like  and  wherein the extent of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol the basicity of amines is almost solely governed by the electronic factors within the molecule
   the following statement is incorrect or excessively vague protonated ammonia is heavily solvated making the cation most stable

the most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by  with alcohols

these reactions require catalysts specialized apparatus and additional purification measures since the selectivity can be problematic the same amines can be prepared by treatment of  with ammonia and amines
rx + 2 r′nhsub2 sub → rr′nh + rr′nhsub2 subx
such reactions which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control name ullmann  selectivity can be improved via the  although this is rarely employed on a industrial scale

absolute zero is the lower limit of the  scale a state at which the  and  of a cooled  reaches its minimum value taken as 0 the theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the  by international agreement absolute zero is taken as −27315° on the  scale  name sib2115 note the triple point of water is 001 °c not 0 °c thus 0 k is −27315 °c not −27316 °c  name arora  which equates to −45967° on the  scale  or   the corresponding  and  temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition
it is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid and then to solid and the sum of the  gas to liquid and  liquid to solid exceeds the ideal gass change in enthalpy to absolute zero in the  description matter solid at absolute zero is in its  the point of lowest 
the  dictate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means as the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent  a system at absolute zero still possesses   the energy of its ground state at absolute zero the  of the ground state cannot be removed 
 
scientists have achieved temperatures extremely close to absolute zero where matter exhibits  such as  and 
at temperatures near 0ampnbspk nearly all molecular motion ceases and Δsampnbsp ampnbsp0 for any  where s is the   in such a circumstance pure substances can ideally form perfect s as t → 0 s strong form of the  states the  of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero the original   makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any  approaches zero as t → 0
math \lim_{t \to 0} \delta s   0  math
the implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value
blockquotethe  identifies the  tampnbsp ampnbsp0 as coincident with the  sampnbsp ampnbsp0 although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct as no two adiabats intersect no other adiabat can  the tampnbsp ampnbsp0 isotherm consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature ≈ampnbspcallen ppampnbsp189–190 blockquote
an even stronger assertion is that it is impossible by any procedure to reduce the temperature of a system to zero in a finite number of operations ≈ampnbspguggenheim pampnbsp157
a perfect crystal is one in which the internal  structure extends uninterrupted in all directions the perfect order can be represented by translational  along three not usually   every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping for  which have two or more stable crystalline forms such as diamond and  for  there is a kind of chemical degeneracy the question remains whether both can have zero entropy at tampnbsp ampnbsp0 even though each is perfectly ordered
perfect crystals never occur in practice imperfections and even entire amorphous materials simply get frozen in at low temperatures so transitions to more stable states do not occur
using the  the  and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to tsupampnbsp3 sup while the  and  are proportional to tsupampnbsp4 sup guggenheim pampnbsp111 these quantities drop toward their tampnbsp ampnbsp0 limiting values and approach with zero slopes for the specific heats at least the limiting value itself is definitely zero as borne out by experiments to below 10ampnbspk even the less detailed  shows this curious drop in specific heats in fact all specific heats vanish at absolute zero not just those of crystals likewise for the coefficient of   show that various other quantities also vanish these  were unanticipated
since the relation between changes in  g the enthalpy h and the entropy is
math \delta g   \delta h   t \delta s \ math
thus as t decreases Δg and Δh approach each other so long as Δs is bounded experimentally it is found that all spontaneous processes including s result in a decrease in g as they proceed toward  if Δs and or t are small the condition Δgampnbspampnbsp0 may imply that Δhampnbspampnbsp0 which would indicate an  reaction however this is not required  reactions can proceed spontaneously if the tΔs term is large enough
moreover the slopes of the s of Δg and Δh converge and are equal to zero at tampnbsp ampnbsp0 this ensures that Δg and Δh are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate  principle of thomsen and berthelot which states that the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one which evolves the greatest amount of heat ie an actual process is the most exothermic one callen ppampnbsp186–187
one model that estimates the properties of an  gas at absolute zero in metals is the  the electrons being  have to be in different quantum states which leads the electrons to get very high typical  even at absolute zero the maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the  the  is defined as this maximum energy divided by boltzmanns constant and is of the order of 80000 k for typical electron densities found in metals for temperatures significantly below the fermi temperature the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero this explains the failure of the classical  for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century
a bose–einstein condensate bec is a  of a dilute gas of weakly interacting s confined in an external  and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero under such conditions a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest  of the external potential at which point quantum effects become apparent on a  
this state of matter was first predicted by  and  in 1924–25 bose first sent a paper to einstein on the  of light quanta now called s einstein was impressed translated the paper from english to german and submitted it for bose to the  which published it einstein then extended boses ideas to material particles or matter in two other papersclark ronald w einstein the life and times avon books 1971 pp 408–9 isbn 0 380 01159 x 
seventy years later in 1995 the first gaseous  was produced by  and  at the    lab using a gas of  atoms cooled to 170  nk   
a record cold temperature of 450ampnbsp±80ampnbsppk in a  bec of sodium atoms was achieved in 2003 by researchers at   the associated  peak emittance wavelength of 6400 kilometers is roughly the radius of earth
absolute or  temperature is conventionally measured in s celsius scaled increments and in the   scaled increments with increasing rarity absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the degree so the ratios of two absolute temperatures tsub2 sub tsub1 sub are the same in all scales the most transparent definition of this standard comes from the  it can also be found in  for particles of half integer  and  for particles of integer spin all of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing s of energy at the particle level over kt with k representing the  and t representing the temperature observed at the  level name sib2115 
temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar celsius or  scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales certain  can achieve truly negative temperatures that is their  expressed in kelvin can be of a  quantity a system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero rather a system with a negative temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature in the sense that if a negative temperature system and a positive temperature system come in contact heat will flow from the negative  to the positive temperature system name chase 
most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their  however some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy such a systems temperature becomes negative even though energy is being added name chase  as a result the boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy theore no complete system ie including the electromagnetic modes can have negative temperatures since there is no highest energy state citation neededso that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures however for quasi equilibrium systems eg spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field this argument does not apply and negative effective temperatures are attainable
on 3 january 2013 physicists announced that they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom for the first time 
one of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was  his 1665 new experiments and observations touching cold articulated the dispute known as the primum frigidum  the concept was well known among naturalists of the time some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth as one of the four s others within water others air and some more recently within  but all of them seemed to agree that there is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality 
the question whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible and if so where the zero must be placed was first addressed by the french physicist  in 1702 in connection with his improvements in the  in his instrument temperatures were indicated by the height at which a column of mercury was sustained by a certain mass of air the volume or spring of which varied with the heat to which it was exposed amontons theore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air in it was reduced to nothing on the scale he used the boiling point of water was marked at +73 and the melting point of ice at 51 so that the zero of his scale was equivalent to about −240 on the celsius scale
this close approximation to the modern value of −27315ampnbsp°c name sib2115  for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by  who observed that −270ampnbsp°c might be regarded as absolute cold 
values of this order for the absolute zero were not however universally accepted about this period  and  in their 1780 treatise on heat arrived at values ranging from 1500 to 3000 below the freezing point of water and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below  in his chemical philosophy gave ten calculations of this value and finally adopted −3000ampnbsp°c as the natural zero of temperature
after  had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat  approached the question from an entirely different point of view and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature which was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on  theory of the motive power of heat  it followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −27315ampnbsp°c at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air thermometer 
the average temperature of the universe today is approximately  based on measurements of   
absolute zero cannot be achieved although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of  s and nuclear adiabatic demagnetization the use of  has produced temperatures less than a billionth of a kelvin  at very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero matter exhibits many unusual properties including  ity and  to study such  scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures
 the current world record was set in 1999 at 100 picokelvins pk or 0000 000 000 1 of a kelvin by cooling the nuclear spins in a piece of  metal 
 in november 2000  temperatures below 100ampnbsppk were reported for an experiment at the s low temperature lab however this was the temperature of one particular  –ampnbspa  property called nuclear spinampnbsp– not the overall average  for all possible degrees in freedom

an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between a  and its surroundings in an adiabatic process energy is transferred only as work name carathéodory 1909 untersuchungen über die grundlagen der thermodynamik mathematische annalen 67 355–386  a translation may be found http  neo classical physicsinfo uploads 3 0 6 5 3065888 caratheodory_ _thermodynamicspdf here  also a mostly reliable http  booksgooglecomau booksid xwbraaaamaajampq investigation+into+the+foundations translation is to be found at kestin j 1976 the second law of thermodynamics dowden hutchinson amp ross stroudsburg pa  name bailyn 21bailyn m 1994 a survey of thermodynamics american institute of physics press new york isbn 0 88318 797 3 p 21  the adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the  and as such it is a key concept in 
some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the adiabatic approximation meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system name bailyn 53bailyn m 1994 pp 52–53 
in way of example the  is an idealization that uses the adiabatic approximation so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel the adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a  if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings
a process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system so that q   0 is called an adiabatic process and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated 1966 generalized thermodynamics mit press cambridge ma adiabatic partitions inhibit the transfer of heat and mass p 48  the assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption for example the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process little of the systems energy can be transferred out as heat even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive that process is idealized to be adiabatic the same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system
the assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one and is often combined with others  so as to make the calculation of the systems behaviour possible such assumptions are idealizations the behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations but the assumption of such perfect behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works according to  when sound travels in a gas there is no loss of heat in the medium and the propagation of sound is adiabatic for this adiabatic process the  e   γp where γ is the  at constant pressure and at constant volume γ   csubp sub   csubv sub  and p is the pressure of the gas  
for a closed system one may write the  thus  where  denotes the change of the systems internal energy  the the quantity of energy added to it as heat and  the work done on it by its surroundings
if the system has rigid walls such that work cannot be transferred in or out  and the walls of the system are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat  and there is no phase change the temperature of the system will rise
if the system has rigid walls such that pressure–volume work cannot be done and the system walls are adiabatic  but energy is added as isochoric work in the form of friction or the stirring of a viscous fluid within the system  and there is no phase change the temperature of the system will rise
if the system walls are adiabatic  but not rigid  and in a fictive idealized process energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless non viscous pressure–volume work and there is no phase change the temperature of the system will rise such a process is called an  and is said to be reversible fictively if the process is reversed the energy added as work can be recovered entirely as work done by the system if the system contains a compressible gas and is reduced in volume the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic  should the work be added in such a way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system then the process is not isentropic and if there is no phase change then the temperature of the system will rise the process is said to be irreversible and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work
if the walls of a system are not adiabatic and energy is transferred in as heat entropy is transferred into the system with the heat such a process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic having  and  according to the second law of thermodynamics
naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible entropy is produced
the transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds in one such kind there is no entropy produced within the system no friction viscous dissipation etc and the work is only pressure volume work denoted by  in nature this ideal kind occurs only approximately because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation
the other extreme kind of work is isochoric work  for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system a stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls without phase change will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid but that work is not recoverable isochoric work is irreversiblemünster a 1970 classical thermodynamics translated by es halberstadt wiley–interscience london isbn 0 471 62430 6 p 45  the second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process of transfer of energy as work always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work every natural process adiabatic or not is irreversible with  as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent
the adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas adiabatic expansion against pressure or a spring causes a drop in temperature in contrast  is an  process for an ideal gas
adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings eg a  compressing a gas contained within an adiabatic cylinder  this finds practical application in  which rely on the lack of quick heat dissipation during their compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it
adiabatic heating occurs in the  when an  descends for example in a   or  flowing downhill over a mountain range when a parcel of air descends the pressure on the parcel increases due to this increase in pressure the parcels volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air thus increasing its internal energy which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air the parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation heat and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and an the process an adiabatic process
adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased allowing it to expand thus causing it to do work on its surroundings when the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced the air in the parcel is allowed to expand as the volume increases the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases adiabatic cooling occurs in the  with  and  and this can form  or s
adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid one technique used to reach very low temperatures thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero is via  where the change in  on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling also the contents of an  can be described to first order as an adiabatically cooling fluid see   
rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as s name kavanagh 
such temperature changes can be quantified using the  or the  for atmospheric processes
in practice no process is truly adiabatic many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption there is always some heat loss as no perfect insulators exist
the mathematical equation for an  undergoing a reversible ie no entropy generation adiabatic process can be represented by the  equation 
 math p v^{n}   \operatorname{constant} \qquad  math name bailyn 53 
where p is pressure v is volume and for this case mathn \gamma math where 
 math \gamma   {c_{p} \over c_{v}}   \frac{f + 2}{f}  math
math c_{p}  math being the  for constant pressure
math c_{v}  math being the specific heat for constant volume math \gamma  math is the  and math f  math is the number of  3 for monatomic gas 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules eg carbon dioxide
for a monatomic ideal gas math \gamma   5 3 \ math and for a diatomic gas such as  and  the main components of  math \gamma   7 5 \ mathhttp  hyperphysicsphy astrgsuedu hbase thermo adiabhtml adiabatic processes  note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not  or 
for reversible adiabatic processes it is also true that
 math p^{1 \gamma}t^{\gamma}  \operatorname{constant} math name bailyn 53 
 math vt^{f 2}   \operatorname{constant}  math
where t is an absolute temperature this can also be written as
 math tv^{\gamma   1}   \operatorname{constant}  math name bailyn 53 
the compression stroke in a  can be used as an example of adiabatic compression  the simplifying assumptions are the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000ampnbspcmsup3 sup one litre the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so math\gamma  math   7 5 the compression ratio of the engine is 101 that is the 1000ampnbspcmsup3 sup volume of uncompressed gas be reduced to 100ampnbspcmsup3 sup by the piston and that the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure a warm room temperature of ~27ampnbsp°c or 300 k and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100 kpa or about 147 psi ie typical sea level atmospheric pressure
math p v^{\gamma}   \operatorname{constant}   100000 \operatorname{pa} \times 1000^{7 5}   100 \times 10^3 \times 158 \times 10^3   158 \times 10^9  math
so our adiabatic constant for this example is about 158 billion
the gas is now compressed to a 100ampnbspcmsup3 sup volume we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas  the new volume is 100ampnbspcmsup3 sup but the constant for this experiment is still 158 billion
math p v^{\gamma}   \operatorname{constant}   158 \times 10^9   p \times 100^{7 5}  math
so solving for p
math p   158 \times 10^9   {100^{7 5}}   158 \times 10^9   6309    250 \times 10^6 \operatorname{ pa}  math
or about 362 psi or 245 atm  note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 101 compression ratio would indicate this is because the gas is not only compressed but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy which manifests itself by a rise in the gass temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure
we can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well using the ideal gas law pv rt r the specific gas constant for that gas
our initial conditions are 100000 pa of pressure 1000ampnbspcmsup3 sup volume and 300 k of temperature so our experimental constant is
math {p v \over t}   \operatorname {constant}   }   t      751  math
that is a final temperature of 751 k or 477ampnbsp°c or 892ampnbsp°f well above the ignition point of many fuels  this is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self ignite which would cause  when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure or that a  with an  to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous  a  operates under even more extreme conditions with compression ratios of 201 or more being typical in order to provide a very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel
for an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against the work done by or on the system is zero since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work the first law of thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero for an ideal gas the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case since at constant temperature the entropy is proportional to the volume the entropy increases in this case theore this process is irreversible
the definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero math\delta q 0  math then according to the 
math \text{1} \qquad d u + \delta w   \delta q   0  math
where mathdu math is the change in the internal energy of the system and math\delta w math is work done
by the system  any work math\delta w math done must be done at the expense of internal energy mathu math since no heat math\delta q math is being supplied from the surroundings pressure volume work math\delta w math done by the system is defined as
math \text{2} \qquad \delta w   p \ dv  math
however mathp math does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but
instead changes along with mathv math
it is desired to know how the values of mathdp math and
mathdv math relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds
for an ideal gas the internal energy is given by
math \text{3} \qquad u   \alpha n r t  math
where bigmath{\alpha} math big is the number of  divided by two mathr math is the  and mathn math is the number of moles in the system a constant
differentiating equation 3 and use of the  mathp v   n r t math yields
math \text{4} \qquad d u   \alpha n r \ dt
                    \alpha \ d p v
                    \alpha p \ dv + v \ dp  math
equation 4 is often expressed as math d u   n c_{v} \ d t  math
because math c_{v}   \alpha r  math
now substitute equations 2 and 4 into equation 1 to obtain
 math  p \ dv   \alpha p \ dv + \alpha v \ dp math
factorize math  p \ dv math
 math   \alpha + 1 p \ dv   \alpha v \ dp math
and divide both sides by pv
 math  \alpha + 1 {d v \over v}   \alpha {d p \over p}  math
after integrating the left and right sides from mathv_0 math to mathv math and from mathp_0 math to mathp math and changing the sides respectively
 math \ln \left {p \over p_0} \right   { {\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}} \ln \left {v \over v_0} \right  math
exponentiate both sides and substitute math{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha} math with math\gamma math the 
 math \left {p \over p_0} \right   \left {v \over v_0} \right^{ {\gamma}}   math
and eliminate the negative sign to obtain
 math \left {p \over p_0} \right   \left {v_0 \over v} \right^{\gamma}   math
theore
 math \left {p \over p_0} \right \left {v \over v_0} \right^{\gamma}   1 math
and
 math p_0 v_0^{\gamma}   p v^\gamma   \operatorname{constant}  math
substituting the ideal gas law into the above we obtain
 math p n r t p^\gamma   \operatorname{constant}  math
which simplifies to
 math p^{1 \gamma} t^\gamma   \operatorname{constant}  math
the change in internal energy of a system measured from state 1 to state 2 is equal to
math \text{1} \qquad \delta u   \alpha r nt_2   \alpha r nt_1   \alpha rn \delta t  math
at the same time the work done by the pressure volume changes as a result from this process is equal to
math \text{2} \qquad w   \int_{v_1}^{v_2}p\ dv  math
since we require the process to be adiabatic the following equation needs to be true
math \text{3} \qquad \delta u + w   0  math
by the previous derivation
math \text{4} \qquad p v^\gamma   \text{constant}   p_1 v_1^\gamma  math
rearranging 4 gives
math p   p_1 \left\frac{v_1}{v} \right^\gamma  math
substituting this into 2 gives
math w   \int_{v_1}^{v_2}p_1 \left\frac{v_1}{v} \right^\gamma\ dv  math
integrating
math w   p_1 v_1^\gamma \frac{v_2^{1 \gamma} v_1^{1 \gamma}}{1 \gamma}  math
substituting math \gamma   \frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha}  math
math w     \alpha p_1 v_1^{\gamma} \left v_2^{1 \gamma}   v_1^{1 \gamma} \right  math
rearranging
math w     \alpha p_1 v_1 \left \left \frac{v_2}{v_1} \right^{1 \gamma}   1 \right  math
using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity as often happens in practical cases
math w     \alpha n r t_1 \left \left \frac{v_2}{v_1} \right^{1 \gamma}   1 \right  math
by the continuous formula
math \frac{p_2}{p_1} \left\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right^{ \gamma}  math
or
math \left\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right^{ 1 \over \gamma} \frac{v_2}{v_1}  math
substituting into the previous expression for math w  math
math w     \alpha n r t_1 \left \left \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right^{\frac{\gamma 1}{\gamma}}   1 \right  math
substituting this expression and 1 in 3 gives
math \alpha n r t_2   t_1   \alpha n r t_1 \left \left \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right^{\frac{\gamma 1}{\gamma}}   1 \right  math
simplifying
math t_2   t_1    t_1 \left \left \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right^{\frac{\gamma 1}{\gamma}}   1 \right  math
simplifying
math \frac{t_2}{t_1} 1    \left \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right^{\frac{\gamma 1}{\gamma}}   1  math
simplifying
math t_2   t_1 \left \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right^{\frac{\gamma 1}{\gamma}}  math
an adiabat is a curve of constant  on the p v diagram some properties of adiabats on a p v diagram are indicated these properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases except in the region where pv becomes small low temperature where quantum effects become important
# every adiabat  both the v axis and the p axis just like 
# each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once
# an adiabat looks similar to an isotherm except that during an expansion an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm so it has a steeper inclination more vertical
# if isotherms are concave towards the north east direction 45° then adiabats are concave towards the east north east 31°
# if adiabats and isotherms are graphed at regular intervals of entropy and temperature respectively like altitude on a contour map then as the eye moves towards the axes towards the south west it sees the density of isotherms stay constant but it sees the density of adiabats grow  the exception is very near absolute zero where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare see 
the following diagram is a p v diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms
the isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves
the adiabats are isentropic
volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis
the term adiabatic literally means not to be passed through it is formed from the ancient   α not + διαβατός able to be passed through in turn deriving from  διὰ  through and βαῖνειν to walk go come thus ἀδιάβατος   1940 a greek english lexicon clarendon press oxford uk  according to 
   and to  name  partington 122  the term was introduced by  name rankine 1866 1866 on the theory of explosive gas engines the engineer july 27 1866 at page 467 of the reprint in https  archiveorg details miscellaneoussci00rank miscellaneous scientific papers edited by wj millar 1881 charles griffin london 
the etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of  and of transfer of matter across the wall
the adiabatic process has been important for thermodynamics since its early days it was important in the work of joule because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work
for a thermodynamic system that is enclosed by walls that do not pass matter energy can pass in and out only as heat or work thus a quantity of work can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in a cycle of two limbs the first is an isochoric adiabatic work process that adds to the systems internal energy then an isochoric and workless heat transfer returns the system to its original state the first limb adds a definite amount of energy and the second removes it accordingly rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work rather than as a calorimetric quantity 1854 on the geometrical representation of the expansive action of heat and theory of thermodynamic engines proc roy soc 144 115–175 https  archiveorg stream miscellaneoussci00rank#page 340 mode 1up miscellaneous scientific papers p 339  in 1854 rankine used a quantity that he called the thermodynamic function that later was called entropy and at that time he wrote also of the curve of no transmission of heat 1854  on the geometrical representation of the expansive action of heat and theory of thermodynamic engines proc roy soc 144 115–175 https  archiveorg stream miscellaneoussci00rank#page 341 mode 1up search transmission miscellaneous scientific papers p 341  which he later called an adiabatic curve name rankine 1866  besides it two isothermal limbs carnots cycle has two adiabatic limbs
for the foundations of thermodynamics the conceptual importance of this was emphasized by bryan 1907 https  archiveorg details ost physics thermodynamicsin00bryauoft thermodynamics an introductory treatise dealing mainly with first principles and their direct applications bg teubner leipzig  by carathéodory name carathéodory  and by born 1949 https  archiveorg details naturalphilosoph032159mbp natural philosophy of cause and chance oxford university press london  the reason is that calorimetry presupposes temperature as already defined before the statement of the first law of thermodynamics but it is better not to make such a presupposition rather the definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature is best left till the second law is available as a conceptual basis name bailyn ch 3bailyn m 1994 a survey of thermodynamics american institute of physics new york isbn 0 88318 797 3 chapter 3 
in the eighteenth century the law of conservation of energy was yet to be fully formulated or established and the nature of heat was debated one approach to these problems was to regard heat measured by calorimetry as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity by the middle of the nineteenth century it was recognized as a form of energy and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized the view that eventually established itself and is currently regarded as right is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential in this light heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a  but rather is a variable that describes a process of transfer between two bodies the abiabatic process is important because it is a logical ingredient of this current view name bailyn ch 3 
this present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics and the word adiabatic is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics introduced by rankine it is pointed out in the present article that for example if a compression of a gas is rapid then there is little time for heat transfer to occur even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall in this sense a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be adiabatic though often far from isentropic even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall
 and  however use the word adiabatic  one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense in quantum theory the word adiabatic can mean something perhaps near isentropic or perhaps near quasi static but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines
on one hand in quantum theory if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly that is to say quasi statically it is said to have been done adiabatically the idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously so that no quantum jump is triggered and the change is virtually reversible while the occupation numbers are unchanged nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one to one corresponding pre and post compression eigenstates thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system for example  writes actually it is usually the adiabatic case with which we have to do ie the limiting case where the external force or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other acts very slowly in this case to a very high approximation
mathc_1^2 1\\c_2^2 0\\c_3^2 0\\ math
that is there is no probability for a transition and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation such a slow perturbation is theore reversible as it is classically 1927 physical aspects of quantum mechanics nature 119 354–357 translation by robert oppenheimer 
on the other hand in quantum theory if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates as well as changing their shapes in that theory such a rapid change is said not to be adiabatic and the contrary word  is applied to it one might guess that perhaps clausius if he were confronted with this in the now obsolete language he used in his day would have said that internal work was done and that heat was generated though not transferred
in classical thermodynamics such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated and there is no transfer of energy as heat the strong irreversibility of the change due to viscosity or other entropy production does not impinge on this classical usage
thus for a mass of gas in macroscopic thermodynamics words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer even if the system is not adiabatically isolated but in quantum statistical theory a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term the words are used differently in the two disciplines as stated just above

an amide  or  or http  wwwcollinsdictionarycom dictionary english amide  http  wwwoxforddictionariescom us definition english amide  also known as an acid amide is a compound with the functional group rsubn subeosubx subnrsub2 sub r and r er to h or organic groups most common are s organic amides n   1 e   c x   1 but many other important types of amides are known including s n   2 e   p x   1 and many related formulas and s e   s x  2  the term amide ers both to classes of compounds and to the  rsubn subeosubx subnrsub2 sub within those compounds
amide can also er to the  of  the anion hsub2 subnsup− sup or of an organic  an anion rsub2 subnsup− sup for discussion of these  amides see 
the remainder of this article is about the   sense of amide
the simplest amides are derivatives of ammonia wherein one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an  group the ensemble is generally represented as rconhsub2 sub closely related and even more numerous are amides derived from primary amines rnhsub2 sub with the formula rconhr amides are also commonly derived from s rrnowiki nowikinh with the formula rconrrnowiki nowiki amides are usually regarded as derivatives of s in which the  group has been replaced by an amine or ammonia
the lone pair of s on the  is delocalized into the carbonyl thus forming a partial  between n and the   consequently the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal it is estimated that acetamide is described by  a for 62% and by b for 28%does not sum to 100% name   kemnitz

in the usual nomenclature one adds the term amide to the stem of the parent acids name for instance the amide derived from  is named  chsub3 subconhsub2 sub iupac recommends  but this and related formal names are rarely encountered when the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name thus the amide formed from  and  is nn dimethylacetamide chsub3 subconmesub2 sub where me   chsub3 sub usually even this name is simplified to  cyclic amides are called s they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides functional groups consisting of  ponrsub2 sub and  sosub2 subnrsub2 sub are  and s respectivelyorganic chemistry iupac nomenclature rules c 821 amides http  wwwacdlabscom iupac nomenclature 79 r79_540htm 
some chemists make a pronunciation distinction between the two saying  for the   compound and   for the  others replace one of these with  while still others pronounce both  making them s
compared to s amides are very weak s while the  of an  has a  of about 95 the  of an amide has a pka around −05 theore amides dont have as clearly noticeable  properties in  this relative lack of basicity is explained by the  withdrawing nature of the  where the lone pair of s on the  is delocalized by  on the other hand amides are much stronger s than s s s and s their conjugate acid pka are between −6 and −10 it is estimated  that  is represented by  a for 62% and by b for 28% name   kemnitz  resonance is largely prevented in the very strained 
because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen the carbonyl c o is a stronger dipole than the n–c dipole the presence of a c o dipole and to a lesser extent a n–c dipole allows amides to act as h bond acceptors in primary and secondary amides the presence of n–h dipoles allows amides to function as h bond donors as well thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the n–h hydrogen atoms can donate h bonds as a result of interactions such as these the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons
the proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions its pksuba sub is usually well above 15 conversely under extremely acidic conditions the carbonyl  can become protonated with a pksuba sub of roughly −1
the solubilities of amides and esters are roughly comparable typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds tertiary amides with the important exception of nn dimethylformamide exhibit low solubility in water
the presence of the functional group is generally easily established at least in small molecules they are the most common non basic functional group they can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups by their  amides exhibit a moderately intense νsubco sub band near 1650ampnbspcmsup−1 sup by sup1 suph  conhr signals occur at low fields in x ray crystallography the con center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane

animism from      name   ooviqcsegal p 14  is the  that non human entities—such as animals plants and inanimate objects—possess a spiritual essence name stringer   
animism is used in the  as a term for the belief system of some   especially prior to the development of organized religion  although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals animism is said to describe the most common foundational thread of indigenous peoples spiritual or supernatural perspectives the animistic perspective is so fundamental mundane everyday and taken for granted that most animistic indigenous people do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to animism or even religion  the term is an 
largely due to such  and cultural discrepancies opinion has differed on whether animism ers to a broad religious belief or to a full fledged religion in its own right the currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century by sir  who created it as one of s earliest concepts if not the first 
animism encompasses the beliefs that there is no separation between the  and physical or material world and that s or s exist not only in humans but also in some other animals plants rocks geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment including thunder wind and shadows animism thus rejects  animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words s or metaphors in  some members of the non tribal world also consider themselves animists such as author  sculptor  and many contemporary  name harvey 
earlier anthropological perspectives  since termed the old animism  were concerned with knowledge surrounding what is alive and what factors make something alive
the old animism assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between  and 
critics of the old animism have accused it of preserving colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric
 
the idea of animism was developed by the   in his 1871 book primitive culture in which he defined it as the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general according to tylor animism often includes an idea of pervading life and will in nature  ie a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls this formulation was little different from that proposed by  as  name kuper 2005 85  although the terms now have distinct uses
for tylor animism represented the earliest form of religion being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality
thus for tylor animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake a basic error from which all religion grew he did not believe that animism was inherently illogical but suggested that it arose from early humans dreams and visions and thus while being a rational system it was based on erroneous un scientific observations about the nature of reality stringer notes that his reading of primitive culture led him to believe that tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to “primitive” populations than many of his contemporaries and that tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of  “savage” people and westerners name stringer  
tylor had initially wanted to describe this phenomenon as spiritualism however he decided against this upon recognizing that it would cause confusion with the modern religion of  which was prevalent across western nations during his own time he adopted the term animism from the writings of the german scientist  who in 1708 had developed the term  as a  theory that  formed the  and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes the earliest known usage in english appeared in 1819 
the idea that there had once been one universal form of primitive religion  whether labelled animism totemism or shamanism  has been dismissed as unsophisticated and erroneous by the archaeologist  who stated that it removes complexity a precondition of religion now in all its variants
 
tylors definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of primitive society by lawyers theologians and philologists the debate defined the field of research of a new science – anthropology by the end of the nineteenth century an orthodoxy on primitive society had emerged although few anthropologists today would accept their definition the nineteenth century armchair anthropologists argued primitive society an evolutionary category was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous  related by a series of marriage exchanges their religion was animism – the belief that natural species and objects had souls with the development of private property these descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state these rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of developed religions according to tylor the more scientifically advanced a society became the fewer members of that society believed in animism however any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits to tylor represented survivals of the original animism of early humanity 
in 1869 three years after tylor proposed his definition of animism the edinburgh lawyer john ferguson mclellan argued that the animistic thinking evident in  gave rise to a religion he named  primitive people believed he argued that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal name kuper 2005 85  subsequent debate by the armchair anthropologists including   and  remained focused on  rather than animism with few directly challenging tylors definition indeed anthropologists have commonly avoided the issue of animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich  name bird david 1999 s68 
according to the anthropologist  animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source such as the land itself or the ancestors who provide the basis to life certain indigenous religious groups such as the  are more typically totemic whereas others like the  are more typically animistic in their worldviewingold tim 2000 totemism animism and the depiction of animals in the perception of the environment essays on livelihood dwelling and skill london routledge ppampnbsp112–113 
from his studies into child development  suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief conversely from her ethnographic research  argued the opposite believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society
stewart guthrie saw animism  or attribution as he perred it  as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival he argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats his suggested explanation however did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion
in 2000 guthrie suggested that the most widespread concept of animism was that it was the attribution of spirits to natural phenomena
such as stones and trees
many anthropologists ceased using the term animism deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic however the term had also been claimed by religious groups  namely indigenous communities and   who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs and who in some cases actively identified as animists it was thus readopted by various scholars however they began using the term in a different way placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons some of whom arent human as the religious studies scholar graham harvey stated while the old animist definition had been problematic the term animism was nevertheless of considerable value as a critical academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world
the new animism emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist  which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the  communities of canada in the mid 20th century for the ojibwe encountered by hallowell  did not require human likeness but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons who for instance included rock persons and bear persons for the ojibwe these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others through respectfully interacting with other persons they themselves learned to act as a person hallowells approach to the understanding of ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism he emphasized the need to challenge the modernist western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different world views
hallowells approach influenced the work of anthropologist nurit bird david who produced a  reassessing the idea of animism in 1999 seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal debating bird davis ideas
after a lengthy period of disinterest post modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism modernism is characterized by a cartesian subject object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective and culture from nature in this view animism is the inverse of  and hence inherently invalid drawing on the work of  these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions and theorize that all societies continue to animate the world around them and not just as a tylorian survival of primitive thought rather the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our professional subcultures which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity we like animists also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so called objective world whether pets cars or teddy bears who we recognize as subjects as such these entities are approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists  these approaches are caul to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul name bird david 1999 s68 
nurit bird david argues that positivistic ideas about the meaning of nature life and personhood misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts classical theoreticians it is argued attributed their own modernist ideas of self to primitive peoples while asserting that the primitive peoples read their idea of self into others name bird david 1999 s68  she argues that animism is a relational epistemology and not a tylorian failure of primitive reasoning that is self identity among animists is based on their relationships with others rather than some distinctive feature of the self instead of focusing on the essentialized modernist self the individual persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships dividuals some of which are with superpersons ie non humans
tim ingold like bird david argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment hunter gatherers do not as a rule approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be grasped intellectuallyampnbsp indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice  willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this  and that the animist self identifies with the world feeling at once within and apart from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit  the animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter but through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint senses and sensibilities of his prey to be one with it   in this view is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey
the religious studies scholar graham harvey defined animism as the belief that the world is full of persons only some of whom are human and that life is always lived in relationship with others he added that it is theore concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons
graham harvey in his 2013 handbook of contemporary animism identifies the animist perspective in line with martin bubers i thou as opposed to i it in such harvey says the animist takes an i thou approach to relating to his world where objects and animals are treated as a thou rather than as an it 
guthrie expressed criticism of bird davids attitude toward animism believing that it promulgated the view that the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it this he felt would result in anthropology abandoning the scientific project
there is ongoing disagreement and no general consensus as to whether animism is merely a singular broadly encompassing religious belief  or a worldview in and of itself comprising many diverse mythologies found worldwide in many diverse culturesharvey 2006 p 6  name ishmaelorg  this also raises a controversy regarding the ethical claims animism may or may not make whether animism ignores questions of  altogether  or by endowing various non human elements of nature with spirituality or personhoodclarke peter b and peter beyer eds 2009 the worlds religions continuities and transformations london routledge p 15  in fact promotes a complex

a shaman is a person regarded as having access to and influence in the world of  who typically enters into a  during a  and practices  and http  wwwaskoxfordcom concise_oed shamanview uk oxford dictionary online  shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds shamans are said to treat ailments illness by mending the soul alleviating traumas affecting the soul spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness the shaman also enters  or  to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community shamans may visit other worlds dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements the shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world which in turn affects the human world the restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment name   eli72mircea eliade shamanism archaic techniques of ecstasy bollingen series lxxvi princeton university press 1972 pp 3–7 
animism is not the same as  although the two are sometimes confused some religions are both pantheistic and animistic one of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united monism the way pantheists do as a result animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul in pantheism everything shares the same spiritual essence rather than having distinct spirits and or soulspaul a harrison elements of pantheism 2004 p 11 carl mccolman when someone you love is wiccan a guide to witchcraft and paganism for concerned friends nervous parents and curious co workers 2002 p 97

animism entails the belief that animals are people too and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans subsistence needs the actions of non human animals are viewed as intentional planned and purposive and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others in animist world views non human animals are understood to participate in  systems and ceremonies with humans as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a  held by the   in 1996 an eagle flew over the proceedings circling over the central drum group the assembled participants called out kitpu eagle conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty and they later articulated the view that the eagles actions lected its approval of the event and the mikmaqs return to traditional spiritual practices
some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly the most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the formers collection of the latter for food and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully harvey cited the example of maori communities in new zealand who often offer  invocations to  as they dig the latter up while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the maori and the sweet potatoes with both understood as having arrived in  together in the same canoes in other instances animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable among some modern pagans for instance relationships are cultivated with specific trees who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts such as flowers sap or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a  in return these pagans give offerings to the tree itself which can come in the form of s of mead or ale a drop of blood from a finger or a strand of wool
various animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons discussing ethnographic work conducted among the ojibwe harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate but with two notable exceptions the stones of the  and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning which were understood to have become thunderers themselves the ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood with storms being conceived of as persons known as thunderers whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests throwing lightning at lake monsters wind similarly can be conceived as a person in animistic thought
the importance of place is also a recurring element of animism with some places being understood to be persons in their own right
 
animism can also entail relationships being established with non corporeal  entities
in the early 20th century  defended a form of animism in his book body and mind a history and defence of animism 1911
the physicist  has argued for quantum animism in which mind permeates the world at every level 
 wrote regarding his quantum animism
harvey opined that animisms views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of  because it accords intelligence rationality consciousness volition agency intentionality language and desire to non humans similarly it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both s and western 
animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork for instance among the maori communities of new zealand there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person and that the persons who are damaged theore have to be placated and respected during the process any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect harvey theore argued that the creation of art among the maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship
harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature citing such examples as the writings of            and

antonio lucio vivaldi  4 march 1678ampnbsp– 28 july 1741 was a venetian  composer  violinist teacher and  born in  he is recognized as one of the greatest baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across europe he is known mainly for composing many instrumental s for the violin and a variety of other instruments as well as sacred choral works and more than forty s his best known work is a series of s known as 
many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the  a home for abandoned children where vivaldi who had been ordained as a  was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740 vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in   and  after meeting the  vivaldi moved to vienna hoping for perment however the emperor died soon after vivaldis arrival and vivaldi himself died less than a year later in poverty
antonio lucio vivaldi was born in 1678 in venice name talbotgrove   then the capital of the  he was  immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger though not known for certain the childs immediate baptism was most likely due either to his poor health or to an  that shook the city that day in the trauma of the earthquake vivaldis mother may have dedicated him to the priesthoodwalter kolneder antonio vivaldi documents of his life and works amsterdam heinrichshofens verlag wilhelmshaven locarno 1982 46  vivaldis official church baptism took place two months later name autogenerated5michael talbot vivaldi london jm dent amp sons ltd 1978 39

the president of the sovvegno was  an early baroque composer and the maestro di cappella at  it is possible that legrenzi gave the young antonio his first lessons in composition the luxembourg scholar walter kolneder has discerned the influence of legrenzis style in vivaldis early liturgical work laetatus sum  anh 31 written in 1691 at the age of thirteen vivaldis father may have been a composer himself in 1689 an opera titled la fedeltà sfortunata was composed by a giovanni battista rossi – the name under which vivaldis father had joined the sovvegno di santa ceciliaheller p 40

vivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the ospedale della pietà over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working thereheller p 51  there were four similar institutions in venice their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned or whose families could not support them they were financed by funds provided by the republicmarc pincherle vivaldi genius of the baroque paris w w norton amp company inc 1957 18  the boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached 15 the girls received a musical education and the most talented stayed and became members of the ospedales renowned orchestra and choir

despite his frequent travels from 1718 the pietà paid him 2  to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in venice the pietàs records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733
in early 18th century venice opera was the most popular musical entertainment it proved most profitable for vivaldi there were several theaters competing for the publics attention vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline his first opera  rv 729 was performed not in venice but at the garzerie theater in  in 1713heller p 98  the following year vivaldi became the  of the  in venice where his opera  rv 727 was performed the work was not to the publics taste and it closed after a couple of weeks being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year name autogenerated1  
in 1715 he presented  rv 724 now lost with music by seven different composers of which he was the leader the opera contained eleven s and was a success in the late season vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him  rv 700 but the state censor blocked the performance the main character arsilda falls in love with another woman lisea who is pretending to be a man name autogenerated1   vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year and it was a resounding success
at this period the pietà commissioned several liturgical works the most important were two s moyses deus pharaonis rv 643 is lost the second  rv 644 celebrates the victory of the republic of venice against the turks and the recapture of the island of  composed in 1716 it is one of his sacred masterpieces all eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the pietà both the female and male roles many of the s include parts for solo instruments—recorders oboes violas damore and mandolins—that showcased the range of talents of the girlslandon p 52 
also in 1716 vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas  rv 719 and la costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi rv 706 the latter was so popular that it performed two years later re edited and retitled artabano re dei parti rv 701 now lost it was also performed in prague in 1732 in the following years vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over italy
his progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians like  a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a  denouncing him and his operas the pamphlet  attacks vivaldi without mentioning him directly the cover drawing shows a boat the santangelo on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priests hat and playing the violin the marcello family claimed ownership of the teatro santangelo and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution without success the obscure writing under the picture mentions non existent places and names aldiviva is an anagram of a vivaldi
in a letter written by vivaldi to his patron marchese bentivoglio in 1737 he makes erence to his 94 operas only around 50 operas by vivaldi have been discovered and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists although vivaldi may have exaggerated in his dual role of composer and impresario it is plausible that he may either have written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas during a career which by then had spanned almost 25 yearsheller p 97  while vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time he never reached the prominence of other great composers like    and  as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any extended period of time in any major opera house name heller114heller p 114 
his most successful operas were la costanza trionfante and farnace which garnered six revivals each name heller114  
in 1717 or 1718 vivaldi was offered a new prestigious position as maestro di cappella of the court of prince  governor of michael talbot vivaldi london jm dent amp sons ltd 1978 64  he moved there for three years and produced several operas among which was  rv 738 in 1721 he was in milan where he presented the pastoral drama  rv 734 9 arias survive he visited milan again the following year with the oratorio ladorazione delli tre re magi al bambino gesù rv 645 also lost in 1722 he moved to rome where he introduced his operas new style the new  invited vivaldi to play for him in 1725 vivaldi returned to venice where he produced four operas in the same year
during this period vivaldi wrote the  four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season three of the concerti are of original conception while the first spring borrows motifs from a sinfonia in the first act of his contemporaneous opera il giustino the inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around mantua they were a revolution in musical conception in them vivaldi represented flowing creeks singing birds of different species each specifically characterized barking dogs buzzing mosquitoes crying shepherds storms drunken dancers silent nights hunting parties from both the hunters and the preys point of view frozen landscapes ice skating children and warming winter fires each concerto is associated with a  possibly by vivaldi describing the scenes depicted in the music they were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve  opus 8 published in amsterdam by  in 1725

at the height of his career vivaldi received commissions from european nobility and royalty the serenata cantata gloria e imeneo rv 687 was commissioned in 1725 by the french  to venice in celebration of the marriage of  the following year another serenata la sena festeggiante rv 694 was written for and premiered at the french embassy as well celebrating the birth of the french royal princesses  and  vivaldis opus 9  was dedicated to   in 1728 vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting  to oversee the construction of a new port charles admired the music of the red priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years he gave vivaldi the title of  a gold medal and an invitation to vienna vivaldi gave charles a manuscript copy of la cetra a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as opus 9 the printing was probably delayed forcing vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor
accompanied by his father vivaldi traveled to vienna and prague in 1730 where his opera  rv 711 was presentedvivaldis connections with musical life in prague and his association with  the impresario of the  are detailed in daniel e freeman the opera theater of count franz anton von sporck in prague stuyvesant ny pendragon press 1992  some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of italys major writers of the time  and  were written by  the major representative of the  movement and court poet in vienna  was rewritten by the young  from an earlier libretto by 
like many composers of the time the final years of vivaldis life found him in financial difficulties his compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in venice changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded in response vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to walter kolneder antonio vivaldi documents of his life and works amsterdam heinrichshofens verlag wilhelmshaven locarno 1982 179  the reasons for vivaldis departure from venice are unclear but it seems likely that after the success of his meeting with emperor charles vi he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court on his way to vienna vivaldi may have stopped in graz to see anna giròwalter kolneder antonio vivaldi documents of his life and works amsterdam heinrichshofens verlag wilhelmshaven locarno 1982 180 
it is also likely that vivaldi went to vienna to stage operas especially as he took up residence near the  shortly after his arrival in vienna charles vi died which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income soon afterwards vivaldi became impoverishedlandon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of vivaldis death which reached venice in the commemorali gradenigo abbe lord antonio vivaldi incomparable virtuoso of the violin known as the red priest much esteemed for his compositions and concertos who earned more than 50000 ducats in his life but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in vienna landon p 166 marc pincherle vivaldi genius of the baroque paris w w norton amp company inc 1957 53  and died during the night of 27 28 july 1741 aged 63talbot p 69 gives the 27th as the day of death formichetti p 194 reports that he died during the night and his death was the first registered on the next day heller p 263 states the composers death is noted in the official coroners report and in the burial account book of st stephens cathedral parish as having occurred on 28 july 1741 but the so called totenbeschauprotokoll is not a reliable source since the date can er to when the entry was made not to the actual time of death  of internal infection in a house owned by the widow of a viennese saddlemaker on 28 july he was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund vivaldis funeral took place at  but the young  had nothing to do with this burial since no music was performed on that occasion http  michaelorenzblogspotcoat 2014 06 haydn singing at vivaldis exequieshtml haydn singing at vivaldis exequies an ineradicable myth vienna 2014  the cost of his funeral with a kleingeläut was 19 gulden 45 kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells

only three portraits of vivaldi are known to survive an engraving an ink sketch and an oil painting the engraving by francois morellon la cave was made in 1725 and shows vivaldi holding a sheet of music the ink sketch a  was done by  in 1723 and shows vivaldis head and shoulders in profile the oil painting which can be seen in the liceo musicale of bologna gives what is possibly the most accurate picture and shows vivaldis red hair under his blonde wigmichael talbot vivaldi london jm dent amp sons ltd 1978 93 
vivaldis music was innovative he brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes many of his compositions are flamboyantly almost playfully exuberant   some compositions before vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant what does this tell us

during his lifetime vivaldis popularity quickly made him famous in other countries including france but after his death the composers popularity dwindled after the baroque period vivaldis published concerti became relatively unknown and were largely ignored even vivaldis most famous work the four seasons was unknown in its original edition during the  and  periods
during the early 20th century s concerto in c in the style of vivaldi which he passed off as an original vivaldi work helped revive vivaldis reputation this spurred the french scholar  to begin an academic study of vivaldis oeuvre many vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered which were acquired by the  as a result of the generous sponsorship of ese businessmen roberto foa and filippo giordano in memory of their sons this led to a renewed interest in vivaldi by among others mario rinaldi       and  all of whom were instrumental in the vivaldi revival of the 20th century
in 1926 in a monastery in  researchers discovered fourteen folios of vivaldis work that were previously thought to have been lost during the  some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the grand duke durazzo who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century the volumes contained 300 concertos 19 operas and over 100 vocal instrumental worksantonio vivaldi biography by alexander kuznetsov and louise thomas a booklet attached to the cd the best of vivaldi published and recorded by madacy entertainment group inc st laurent quebec canada 
the resurrection of vivaldis unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of  who in 1939 organized the historic vivaldi week in which the rediscovered  rv 589 and lolimpiade were revived since  vivaldis compositions have enjoyed wide success s often on original instruments have increased vivaldis fame still further
recent rediscoveries of works by vivaldi include two  settings of nisi dominus rv 803 in eight movements and dixit dominus rv 807 in eleven movements these were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively by the australian scholar janice stockigt the vivaldi scholar  described rv 807 as arguably the best nonoperatic work from vivaldis pen to come to light since the 1920smichael talbot liner notes to the cd vivaldi dixit dominus körnerscher sing verein dresden dresdner instrumental concert peter kopp  2006 catalogue number 4776145  vivaldis lost 1730 opera  rv 697 was rediscovered in 2006 by the  and conductor ondřej macek whose hofmusici orchestra performed the work at  on 3 may 2008 its first performance since 1730

vivaldis works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems some earlier catalogs are mentioned 
because the simply consecutive complete edition ce numbers did not lect the individual works opus numbers into which compositions were grouped fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with ce numbers combined complete edition ce fanna numbering was especially common in the work of italian groups driving the mid 20th century revival of vivaldi such as gli accademici di milano under piero santi for example the bassoon concerto in b major la notte rv 501 became ce 12 f viii1
despite the awkwardness of having to overlay fanna numbers onto the complete edition number for meaningful grouping of vivaldis oeuvre these numbers displaced the older  numbers as the re discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete
this cataloging work was led by the istituto italiano antonio vivaldi where  was both the director and the editor of the published scores edizioni g ricordi his work built on that of antonio fanna a venetian businessman and the institutes founder and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today
compositions by vivaldi are identified today by  the number assigned by danish musicologist  in works published mostly in the 1970s such as the ryom verzeichnis or répertoire des oeuvres dantonio vivaldi like the complete edition before it the rv does not typically assign its single consecutive numbers to adjacent works that occupy one of the composers single opus numbers its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works these several numbering systems are cross erenced at http  wwwclassicalnet music composer works vivaldi indexphp classicalnet

abraham    birthname abram is the first of the three  his story told in chapters 11 through 25 of the  plays a prominent role in    and the    name barney 1937 12–13 
according to jewish tradition and the bibles internal chronology abraham was born in the  1948 from  1813 http  wwwsefariaorg seder_olam_rabbah1lang enamplayout linesampsidebarlang all seder olam rabbah ch 1 accessed 11 29 2015 
to date there has been little if any archaeological or other scientific evidence to confirm or disconfirm his existence at that time
scholars variously consider abraham to have lived as late as the seventh century bcehttp  ngmnationalgeographiccom print features world asia israel abraham text access date 2015 12 31  or that he is a later literary construct and not a historical person
potentially excavation of his traditional burial site the  at  along with  and or dna analysis from the bodies in comparison with the shared  genes among jewish and arab people his patriarchal offspring by traditionhttp  newssciencemagorg 2000 10 jews and arabs share recent ancestry access date 2015 12 31  
could provide confirming or disconfirming evidence of his existence and chronology
the genesis narrative of abraham traces his descent from  the father of  peoples
and describes his faith journeys and legacy in believing in the god of heaven and earth and departing from his idol worshiping father and homeland to settle in the land of  which god promised to him and his seed
abraham was extremely wealthy and powerful but his wife  was barren so his servant  and  the son of sarahs handmaid  might have been candidates to inherit him
but the couple are visited by an angel and  in her old age bears her only son  who becomes the exclusive heir
abraham purchased at an exorbitant price the  at  to be sarahs burial place when she died thus establishing unequivocal rights to that land 
isaac was married to a woman from his own relatives thus ruling the canaanites out of any right to his inheritance 
abraham later married  and had six more sons but on his death when he was buried beside sarah it was isaac who received all abrahams goods while the other sons received only gifts
the story of abraham is related in  of the 
 the tenth in descent from  begat three sons abraham  and  haran begat  who was thus abrahams nephew and died in his native city  abraham married  who was barren terah with   not nahor   abraham sarai and lot then departed for canaan but settled in a place named haran where terah died at the age of 205  god had told abraham to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him and promised to make of him a great nation bless him make his name great bless them that bless him and curse he who may curse him  abraham was 75 years old when he left haran with his wife sarai his nephew lot and the substance and souls that they had acquired and traveled to  in  
there was a severe famine in the land of canaan so that abraham and lot and their households traveled south to    northern    on the way abraham told his wife sarai to say that she was his sister so that the ians would not kill him  when they entered egypt the pharaohs officials praised sarais beauty to  and she was taken into his palace and abraham was given provisions oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels however god afflicted pharaoh and his household with great plagues for which he tried to find the reason  upon discovering that sarai was a married woman pharaoh demanded that they and their household leave immediately along with all their goods 
when they came back to the bethel and hai area abrahams and lots sizable livestock herds occupied the same pastures this became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each familys cattle the conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that abraham graciously suggested that lot choose a separate area either on the left hand north or on the right hand south that there be no conflict amongst brethren but lot chose to go east to the plain of  where the land was well watered everywhere as far as zoar and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward  abraham went south to  and settled in the plain of  where he built another altar to worship  
during the rebellion of the  against   abrahams nephew lot was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading ite forces the elamite army came to collect the spoils of war after having just defeated the king of sodoms armies  lot and his family at the time were settled on the outskirts of the  which made them a visible target 
one person who escaped capture came and told abraham what happened once abraham received this news he immediately assembled 318 trained servants abrahams force headed north in pursuit of the elamite army who were already worn down from the  when they caught up with them at  abraham devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit and launched a night raid not only were they able to free the captives abrahams unit chased and slaughtered the elamite king  at hobah just north of  they freed lot as well as his household and possessions and recovered all of the goods from sodom that had been taken 
upon abrahams return sodoms king came out to meet with him in the  the kings dale also  king of salem  a priest of  brought out bread and wine and blessed abraham and god abraham then gave melchizedek a  of everything the king of sodom then offered to let abraham keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people although he released the captives abraham used any reward from the king of sodom other than the share to which his allies were entitled 
the word of god came to abraham in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars abraham and god made a covenant ceremony and god told of the future bondage of israel in egypt god described to abraham the land that his offspring would claim the land of the kenites kenizzites kadmonites hittites perizzites rephaims amorites canaanites girgashites and jebusites 
abraham and sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations since after 10 years of living in canaan no child had been born sarai then offered her egyptian handmaiden  for abraham to consort with so that he may have a child by her as his wife after hagar found she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress sarai theore sarai mistreated hagar and hagar fled away en route an angel spoke with hagar at the fountain in the way to  he instructed her to return and that her son would be a wild ass of a man his hand shall be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren she was told to call her son  hagar then called god who spoke to her  thou god seest me kjv from that day the well was called beer lahai roi the well of him that liveth and seeth me kjv margin she then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child abraham was eighty six years of age when ishmael was born 
thirteen years later when abraham was ninety nine years of age god declared abrahams new name abrahamampnbsp– a father of many nations  abraham then received the instructions for the covenant of which  was to be the sign then god declared sarais new name  and blessed her and told abraham i will give thee a son also of her  but abraham laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear  immediately after abrahams encounter with god he had his entire household of men including himself age 99 and ishmael age 13 circumcised 
not long afterward during the heat of the day abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the  of  he looked up and saw three men in the presence of god then he ran and  to the ground to welcome them abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread of which they assented abraham rushed to s tent to order cakes made from choice flour then he ordered a servant boy to prepare a choice calf when all was prepared he set curds milk and the calf before them waiting on them under a tree as they ate 
one of the visitors told abraham that upon his return next year sarah would have a son while at the tent entrance sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages the visitor inquired of abraham why sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age as nothing is too hard for god frightened sarah denied laughing
after eating abraham and the three visitors got up they walked over to the peak that overlooked the cities of the plain to discuss the fate of  for their detestable sins that were so great it moved god to action because abrahams nephew was living in sodom god revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities at this point the two other visitors left for sodom then abraham turned to god and pleaded decrementally with him from fifty persons to less that if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city would not god spare the city for the sake of ten righteous people god declared that he would not destroy the city 
when the two visitors got to sodom to conduct their report they planned on staying in the city square however abrahams nephew lot met with them and strongly insisted that these two men stay at his house for the night a rally of men stood outside of lots home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may know v5 them however lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not known v8 man to the rally of men instead they rejected that notion and sought to break down lots door to get to his male guests  thus confirming that their cry had waxed great before god and they would be destroyed 
early the next morning abraham went to the place where he stood before god he looked out toward sodom and gomorrah and saw what became of the cities of the plain where not even ten righteous v1832 had been found as the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace 
abraham settled between  and  in the land of the s while he was living in  abraham openly claimed that sarah was his sister upon discovering this news king  had her brought to him god then came to abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a mans wife abimelech had not laid hands on her so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation especially since abraham had claimed that he and sarah were siblings in response god told abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist however should he not return the wife of abraham back to him god would surely destroy abimelech and his entire household abimelech was informed that abraham was a prophet who would pray for him
early next morning abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of god in that place and that they might kill him for his wife then abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife  abimelech returned sarah to abraham and gave him gifts of sheep oxen and servants and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in abimelechs lands further abimelech gave abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as sarahs vindication before all abraham then prayed for abimelech and his household since god had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of sarah 
after living for some time in the land of the philistines  and  the chief of his troops approached abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well abraham then reproached abimelech due to his philistine servants aggressive attacks and the seizing of abrahams well abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident then abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to abimelech further to attest that abraham was the one who dug the well he also gave abimelech seven ewes for proof because of this sworn oath they called the place of this well  after abimelech and phicol headed back to  abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called upon the name of the  the everlasting god 
as had been prophesied in mamre the previous year  sarah became pregnant and bore a son to abraham on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision abraham was an hundred years old when his son whom he named isaac was born and he circumcised him when he was eight days old  for sarah the thought of giving birth and nursing a child at such an old age also brought her much laughter as she declared god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me  isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion during the celebration however sarah found ishmael mocking an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of isaac 
 was fourteen years old when abrahams son  was born to a different mother sarah sarah had finally borne her own child even though she had passed her child bearing period when she found ishmael teasing isaac sarah told abraham to send both ishmael and hagar away she declared that ishmael would not share in isaacs inheritance abraham was greatly distressed by his wifes words and sought the advice of his god god told abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded god reassured abraham that in isaac shall seed be called to thee  he also said that ishmael would make a nation because he is thy seed 
early the next morning abraham brought hagar and ishmael out together he gave her bread and water and sent them away the two wandered in the wilderness of  until her bottle of water was completely consumed in a moment of despair she burst into tears after god heard the boys voice an  of god confirmed to hagar that he would become a great nation a well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives as the boy grew he became a skilled  living in the wilderness of  eventually his mother found a wife for ishmael from her home country the land of egypt 
at some point in s youth abraham was commanded by god to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of  the patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that god told him of he commanded the servants to remain while he and isaac proceeded alone into the mount isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed along the way isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was to which abraham replied god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering just as abraham was about to sacrifice his son he was interrupted by the angel of the  and he saw behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns which he sacrificed instead of his son for his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity after this event abraham went to  
sarah died and abraham buried her in the  the cave of machpelah near  which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from ephron the   after the death of sarah abraham took another wife a  named  by whom he had six sons      and   according to the bible lecting the change of his name to abraham meaning a father of many nations abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the bible among others   the        s   and   and through his nephew lot he was also related to the  and   abraham lived to see his son marry  and possibly to see the birth of his twin grandsons  he died at age 175 and was buried in the cave of machpelah by his sons isaac and ishmael  
 has largely dismissed abrahams purported historicity the 1906  already concluded that abrahams biography in genesis should be regarded as legendary its authors noted that the elamite invasion of genesis 14 may be historical and that abrahams wandering may represent some historical tribal migration but added that by reason of the paucity of information the whole question is obscure
in the early and middle 20th century leading archaeologists such as  and biblical scholars such as  believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the  the 2nd millennium bce in the 1970s new arguments concerning israels past and the biblical texts challenged these views these arguments can be found in  s  1974 and   1975 thompson a literary scholar based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts his thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium and noted how certain biblical texts lected first millennium conditions and concerns van seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names social milieu and messages strongly suggested that they were  creations by the beginning of the 21st century archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham isaac or jacob credible historical figures
abrahams name is apparently very ancient as the tradition found in genesis no longer understands its original meaning probably father is exalted – the meaning offered in genesis 175 father of a multitude is a popular etymology the name is a variant of  and is known to have been a babylonian personal name in the 24th century bce the renaming to abraham in genesis 17 which yields no sense in hebrew may lect simply a spelling variation where the h 
abrahams story like those of the other patriarchs most likely had a substantial oral prehistory at some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the  a majority of scholars believes this stage belongs to the persian period roughly 520–320 bce the mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown but there are currently two important hypotheses the first called persian imperial authorisation is that the post exilic community devised the torah as a legal basis on which to function within the persian imperial system the second is that pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post exilic jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups notably the priesthood and the lay elders
nevertheless the completion of the torah and its elevation to the centre of post exilic judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final pentateuch was based on existing traditions in   written during the exile ie in the first half of the 6th century bce ezekiel an exile in babylon tells how those who remained in judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from abraham but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they dont observe torah   similarly testifies of tension between the people of judah and the returning post exilic jews the  stating that god is the father of israel and that israels history begins with the exodus and not with abraham the conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence eg  is that the figure of abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of judah at the time of the exile and after serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles
abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths   and  in judaism he is the founding father of the covenant the special relationship between the jewish people and godampnbsp– a belief which gives the jews a unique position as the  in christianity the apostle  taught that abrahams faith in god – preceding the  – made him the prototype of all believers  and uncircumcised the islamic prophet  claimed abraham whose submission to god constituted islam as a believer before the fact and undercut jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with god and the covenant
in jewish tradition abraham is called avraham avinu אברהם אבינו our father abraham signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the jews including converts according to jewish tradition and the father of judaism the first jew his story is read in the weekly  reading portions predominantly in the   לֶךְ לְךָ  וַיֵּרָא  חַיֵּי שָׂרָה and  תּוֹלְדֹת
abraham does not loom so large in christianity as he does in judaism and islam it is  as the  who is central to christianity and the idea of a divine  is what separates christianity from the other two religions in  4 abrahams merit is less his obedience to the divine will than his faith in gods ultimate grace this faith provides him the merit for gods having chosen him for the covenant and the covenant becomes one of faith not obediencehttp  wwwuscedu schools college crcc private cmje issues abrahampdf firestone reuven encyclopedia of world history  abraham pdf  i

judaism holds that one becomes a descendant of abraham through birth and christianity that one becomes a descendant through faith but islam holds that descent is unimportantampnbsp– abraham in other words is not the father of the believing community but a link in the chain of prophets that begins with adam and culminates in

baháís believe that abraham was born into a family of polytheists living in what is today iraq when he reached adulthood he rejected the gods of his people and his family and as a result he was exiled from his country and was forced to travel from ‘ur to aleppo in syria’ only his brother lot supported him he then went into the holy land from this exile god caused his descendants to become ‘powerful and the holy land was given to them’ his descendants did great things joseph for example ‘became ruler in egypt’ moses and jesus are believed to be his descendants as is muhammad through abrahams son  furthermore according to  baháulláhs eldest son and his successor the  was a descendant of abraham through the islamic prophet muhammad through abraham ‘the whole of europe and most of asia came under the protecting shadow of the god of israel’ abdu’l baha saw in the fruits of abraham’s own exile a foreshadowing of what he believed would be the consequence  own exile name barney 1937 12–13

abraxas  ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ variant form abrasax ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ  9380 hits on google scholar for abraxas vs 934 for abrasax   was a word of mystic meaning in the system of the   being there applied to the great  gk megas archōn the  of the 365 spheres gk ouranoicf hippolytus refutatio vii 14 irenaeus adversus hæreses i xxiv 7  the word is found in gnostic texts such as the  and also appears in the  it was engraved on certain  called on that account abraxas stones which were used as  or charms as the initial spelling on stones was abrasax Αβρασαξ the spelling of  abraxas seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the greek letters  and  in the latin 
the seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the “he who has his seat within the seven poles—ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩ” in the magical papyri   the word may be related to  although other explanations exist
there are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about basilidess teaching ancient gnostic texts the larger greco roman magical traditions and modern magical and esoteric writings opinions abound on abraxas who in recent centuries has been claimed to be both an ian god and a demonographers have made him a demon who has the head of a king and serpents for feet   the swiss psychiatrist  wrote a short gnostic treatise in 1916 called  which called abraxas the supreme power of being transcending both god and devil and unites all opposites into one being
it is uncertain what the actual role and function of abraxas was in the  as our authorities see below often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of  himself
in the system described by  the unbegotten father is the progenitor of  and from nous  from logos  from phronesis  and  from sophia and dynamis principalities powers and angels the last of whom create the first heaven they in turn originate a second series who create a second heaven the process continues in like manner until 365 heavens are in existence the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world the ruler principem ie probably ton  of the 365 heavens is abraxas and for this reason he contains within himself 365 numbers
the name occurs in the  vii 26 by  who appears in these chapters to have followed the exegetica of basilides after describing the manifestation of the gospel in the ogdoad and hebdomad he adds that the basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several stages of the upper world diastemata in which they speak of 365 heavens and say that their great archon is abrasax because his name contains the number 365 the number of the days in the year ie the sum of the numbers denoted by the greek letters in ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ according to the rules of  is 365
Α   1 Β   2 Ρ   100 Α   1 Σ   200 Α   1 Ξ   60
  69 73 f appears to follow partly irenaeus partly the lost compendium of hippolytuslipsius r a zur quellenkritik d epiphanios 99 f  he designates abraxas more distinctly as the power above all and first principle the cause and first archetype of all things and mentions that the basilidians erred to 365 as the number of parts mele in the human body as well as of days in the year
the author of the appendix to tertullian de praescr haer c 4 who likewise follows hippolytuss compendiumlipsius 33 f ampc  adds some further particulars that abraxas gave birth to mind nous the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by irenaeus and epiphanius that the world as well as the 365 heavens was created in honour of abraxas and that christ was sent not by the maker of the world but by abraxas
nothing can be built on the vague allusions of  according to whom abraxas meant for basilides the greatest god de vir ill 21 the highest god dial adv lucif 23 the almighty god comm in amos iii 9 and the lord the creator comm in nah i 11 the notices in  haer fab i 4  haer 4 and praedestinatus i 3 have no independent value
it is evident from these particulars that abrasax was the name of the first of the 365 archons and accordingly stood below sophia and dynamis and their progenitors but his position is not expressly stated so that the writer of the supplement to tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with the supreme god
with the availability of primary sources such as those in  the identity of abrasax remains unclear the holy book of the great invisible spirit for instance ers to abrasax as an  dwelling with  and other aeons of the  in the light of the luminary eleleth in several texts the luminary eleleth is the last of the luminaries spiritual lights that come forward and it is the aeon sophia associated with eleleth who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the demiurges rule of this world and the salvage effort that ensues as such the role of aeons of eleleth including abrasax sophia and others pertains to this outer border of the pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality
a vast number of engraved stones are in existence to which the name abrasax stones has long been given one particularly fine example was included as part of the  from fourth century norfolk uk the subjects are mythological and chiefly grotesque with various inscriptions in which ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ often occurs alone or with other words sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription in certain obscure magical writings of egyptian origin ἀβραξάς or ἀβρασάξ is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gemsreuvens 1830 lett à m letronne s i pap bilingues etc leyden  it is also found on the greek metal tesseræ among other mystic words the meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible but some of the gems are amulets and the same may be the case with nearly all
the abrasax image alone without external iconisms and either without or but a simple inscription the abrasax imago proper is usually found with a shield a sphere or wreath and whip a sword or sceptre a cocks head the body clad with armor and a serpents tail there are however innumerable modifications of these figures lions hawks and eagles skins with or without mottos with or without a trident and star and with or without reverses
abrasax combined with other gnostic powers if in a single instance this supreme being was represented in connection with powers of subordinate rank nothing could have been more natural than to represent it also in combination with its emanations the seven superior spirits the thirty aeons and the three hundred and sixty five cosmical genii and yet this occurs upon none of the relics as yet discovered whilst those with powers not belonging to the gnostic system are frequently met with
abrasax with jewish symbols this combination predominates not indeed with symbolical figures but in the form of inscriptions such as     michael gabriel uriel onoel ananoel raphael japlael and many others the name ΙΑΩ to which ΣΑΒΑΩΘ is sometimes added is found with this figure even more frequently than ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ and they are often combined beside an abrasax figure the following for instance is found iaΩ abpaΣaΞ aΔΩn ΑΤΑ iao abrasax thou art the lordbellermann versuch iii no 10  with the abrasax shield are also found the divine names sabaoth iao iao abrasax adonai abrasax etcbaudissin studien zur semitischen religionsgeschichte i 189 et seq 
abrasax with persian deities chiefly perhaps exclusively in combination with  and possibly a few specimens with the mystical gradations of mithriaca upon gnostic relics
abrasax with egyptian deities it is represented as a figure with the sun god phre leading his chariot or standing upon a lion borne by a crocodile also as a name in connection with        and  in a lotus leaf also with a representation of the nile the symbol of prolificacy with   or with  the symbols of the revivifying energies of nature
abrasax with grecian deities sometimes as a figure and again with the simple name in connection with the planets especially   and  richly engraved
simple or ornamental representations of the journey of departed spirits through the starry world to  borrowed as those above named from the egyptian religion the spirit wafted from the earth either with or without the corpse and transformed at times into  or  is depicted as riding upon the back of a crocodile or lion guided in some instances by anubis and other genii and surrounded by stars and thus attended hastening to judgment and a higher life
representations of the  which like the preceding are either ornamental or plain and imitations of egyptian art with slight modifications and prominent symbols as the vessel in which anubis weighs the human heart as comprehending the entire life of man with all its errors
worship and consecrating services were according to the testimony of  in his description of tho  conducted with figurative representations in the secret assemblies of the gnostics unless indeed the statement on which this opinion rests designates as it readily may a statue of glyptic workmanship it is uncertain if any of the discovered specimens actually represent the gnostic cultus and religious ceremonies although upon some may be seen an abrasax figure laying its hand upon a person kneeling as though for baptism or benediction
astrological groups the gnostics erred everything to astrology even the bardesenists located the inferior powers the seven twelve and thirty six among the planets in the zodiac and starry region as rulers of the celestial phenomena which influence the earth and its inhabitants birth and health wealth and allotment are considered to be mainly under their control other sects betray still stronger partiality for astrological conceits many of these specimens also are improperly ascribed to gnosticism but the gnostic origin of others is too manifest to allow of contradiction
inscriptions of which there are three kinds
those destitute of symbols or iconisms engraved upon stone iron lead and silver plates in greek latin coptic or other languages of amuletic import and in the form of prayers for health and protection
those with some symbol as a serpent in an oval form
those with iconisms at times very small but often made the prominent object so that the legend is limited to a single word or name sometimes the legends are as important as the images it is remarkable however that thus far none of the plates or medals found seem to have any of the forms or prayers reported by origen it is necessary to distinguish those specimens that belong to the proper gnostic period from such as are indisputably of later origin especially since there is a strong temptation to place those of more recent date among the older class

in a great majority of instances the name abraxas is associated with a singular composite figure having a  like appearance somewhat resembling a  or the greek primordial god  not to be confused with the greek titan  according to  as a pantheus ie all god he appears on the amulets with the head of a   or of a lion  or  the body of a man and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions types of the  in his right hand he grasps a club or a flail and in his left is a round or oval shield this form was also erred to as the  budge surmised that abrasax was a form of the  of the  and the primal man whom god made in his own image 
some parts at least of the figure mentioned above are s and the basilidian abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun j j bellermann has speculated that the whole represents the supreme being with his five great emanations each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem thus from the human body the usual form assigned to the deity forasmuch as it is written that god created man in his own image issue the two supporters nous and logos symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding as typified by the serpents for the same reason that had induced the old greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to pallas his head—a cocks—represents phronesis the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance his two hands bear the badges of sophia and dynamis the shield of wisdom and the scourge of powerparaphrased by  
in the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of gnostics during the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense gnostic or specially basilidian or connected with abrasax the subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes
 abrasax or stones of basilidian origin
 abrasaxtes or stones originating in ancient forms of worship and adapted by the gnostics
 abraxoïdes or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of basilides
while it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of gnostics there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin the fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock a lion or an ass and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what irenaeus says about the followers of basilides
incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid gnosticism planted in  and southern  at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth which  connects with basilides and which according to his epist lxxv used the name abrasax
it is theore not unlikely that some gnostics used amulets though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority  properly calls attention to the significant silence of  in the two passages in which he instructs the christians of  on the right use of rings and gems and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them paed 241 ff 287 ff but no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of gnostic mythology has had any success and abrasax is the only gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies the present state of the evidence theore suggests that their engravers and the basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown
having due regard to the  in which many of the unintelligible names of the abrasax stones reappear besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic
the magic papyri lect the same ideas as the abrasax gems and often bear hebraic names of god the following example is illustrative i conjure you by    abrasax and by the great god  name betzed betz hans dieter the greek magical papyri in translation including the demotic spells wessely neue zauberpapyri p 27 no 229  the patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities for which fact many instances may be adduced in the group iakoubia iaōsabaōth adōnai abrasax name betz  ibid p 44 no 715  the first name seems to be composed of  and ya similarly entities considered angels in judaism are invoked as gods alongside abrasax thus i conjure you by the god  by the god  by the god  by the god  by the god abrasax ablathanalba akrammachari name betz  
in text pgm v 96 172 abrasax is identified as part of the true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of israel of the headless one who created heaven and earth who created night and day osoronnophris whom none has ever seen awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit the name also includes iaō and adōnai name betz   osoronnophris represents egyptian    the perfect being name betz   another identification with osiris is made in pgm vii 643 51 you are not wine but the guts of osiris the guts of ablanathanalba akrammachamarei eee who has been stationed over necessity iakoub ia iaō sabaōth adōnai abrasax name betz   pgm viii 1 63 on the other hand identifies abrasax as a name of  ie  name betz   here the numerological properties of the name are invoked with its seven letters corresponding to the seven planets and its  value of 365 corresponding to the days of the year name betz   thoth is also identified with abrasax in pgm lxxix 1 7 i am the soul of darkness abrasax the eternal one michaēl but my true name is thōouth thōouth name betz  
one papyrus titled the monad or the eighth book of  pgm xiii 1 343 contains an invocation to a supreme creator god abrasax is given as being the name of this god in the language of the baboons name betz   the papyrus goes on to describe a cosmogonic myth about abrasax describing how he created the  by laughing his first laughter created light his second divided the  his third created the mind his fourth created fertility and procreation his fifth created fate his sixth created time as the sun and moon and his seventh and final laughter created the soul name betz   then from various sounds made by abrasax there arose the serpent  who foreknew all things the first man or  and the god  who is lord of all name betz   the man fought with iaō and abrasax declared that iaōs power would derive from both of the others and that iaō would take precedence over all the other gods name betz   this text also describes  as an archangel of god abrasax name betz  
the  recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon
the magic word ablanathanalba which reads in greek  also occurs in the abrasax stones as well as in the magic papyri this word is usually conceded to be derived from the hebrew aramaic meaning thou art our father אב לן את and also occurs in connection with abrasax the following inscription is found upon a metal plate in the carlsruhe museum

 fab 183 gives abrax aslo therbeeo as names of horses of the sun mentioned by us the passage is miserably corrupt but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make abraxas
the proper form of the name is evidently abrasax as with the greek writers hippolytus epiphanias didymus de trin iii 42 and theodoret also  and praedestinatus and in nearly all the legends on gems by a probably euphonic inversion the translator of irenaeus and the other latin authors have abraxas which is found in the magical papyri and even though most sparingly on engraved stones
the attempts to discover a derivation for the name greek hebrew coptic or other have not been entirely successful
  thought it egyptian but never gave the proofs which he promised
j j bellermann thinks it a compound of the egyptian words abrak and sax meaning “the honorable and hallowed word” or “the word is adorable”
  finds in it an egyptian invocation to the godhead meaning “hurt me not”
 abraham geiger sees in it a grecized form of ha berakhah “the blessing” a meaning which cw king declares philologically untenable
j b passerius derives it from abh “father” bara “to create” and a  negative—“the uncreated father”
giuseppe barzilai goes back for explanation to the first verse of the prayer attributed to rabbi  the literal rendering of which is “o god with thy mighty right hand deliver the unhappy people” forming from the initial and final letters of the words the word abrakd pronounced abrakad with the meaning “the host of the winged ones” ie angels but this extremely ingenious theory would at most explain only the mystic word abracadabra whose connection with abrasax is by no means certain
 wendelin discovers a compound of the initial letters amounting to 365 in numerical value of four hebrew and three greek words all written with greek characters ab ben rouach hakadōs sōtēria apo xylou “father son spirit holy salvation from the cross”
according to a note of isaac de beausobre’s  accepted the first three of these taking the four others for the initials of the greek anthrōpoussōzōn hagiōi xylōi “saving mankind by the holy cross”
  derives abrasax from the greek habros and saō “the beautiful the glorious savior”
perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by   “which belong to no known speech and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration”
yet we may with better reason suppose that it came originally from a foreign mythology and that the accident of its numerical value in greek merely caused it to be singled out at alexandria for religious use it is worth notice that  and  have the same value the egyptian author of the book  in reply to  vii 4 admits a perence of barbarous to vernacular names in sacred things urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations as the egyptians and  and origen contra cels i 24 ers to the potent names used by egyptian sages n  and indian s signifying deities in the several languages

abydos was occupied by the rulers of the  abydos ii 64  whose town temple and tombs have been found there the temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the  and the cemetery was used continuously
the pharaohs of the  were buried in abydos including  who is regarded as founder of the first dynasty and his successor wilkinson 1999 p 3  it was in this time period that the  were constructed some pharaohs of the second dynasty were also buried in abydos the temple was renewed and enlarged by these pharaohs as well funerary enclosures misinterpreted in modern times as great forts were built on the desert behind the town by three kings of the  the most complete is that of

 in the twenty sixth dynasty rebuilt the temple again and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite finely wrought the foundations of the successive temples were comprised within approximately  depth of the ruins discovered in modern times these needed the closest examination to discriminate the various buildings and were recorded by more than 4000 measurements and 1000 levellingspetrie abydos ii 
the latest building was a new temple of  built in the thirtieth dynasty from the  times of the greek occupancy of egypt that began three hundred years before the roman occupancy that followed the structure began to decay and no later works are knownpetrie abydos i and ii 
from earliest times abydos was a cult centre first of the local deity khentiamentiu and from the end of the old kingdom the rising cult of osiris and isis
a tradition developed that the  was the burial place of osiris and the tomb of  was reinterpreted as that of osiris
decorations in tombs throughout egypt such as the one displayed to the right record journeys to and from abydos as important pilgrimages made by individuals who were proud to have been able to make the vital trip
successively from the first dynasty to the  nine or ten temples were built on one site at abydos the first was an enclosure about  surrounded by a thin wall of unbaked bricks incorporating one wall of this first structure the second temple of about  square was built within a wall about  thick an outer temenos enclosure wall surrounded the grounds this outer wall was thickened about the second or  the old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty and a smaller building was erected behind it enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes
pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by  or cheops in his temple orms
at an undetermined date a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered has yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty a vase of  with purple  inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found the noble statuette of cheops in ivory found in the stone chamber of the temple gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh
the temple was rebuilt entirely on a larger scale by  in the  he placed a great stone gateway to the temenos an outer temenos wall and gateway with a colonnade between the gates his temple was about  inside with stone gateways front and back showing that it was of the processional type in the   added a colonnade and altars soon after  entirely rebuilt the temple laying a stone pavement over the area about  square and added subsidiary chambers soon thereafter in the twelfth dynasty  laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor a great temenos was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size
the temple of seti i was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described this surviving building is best known as the great temple of abydos being nearly complete and an impressive sight a principal purpose of the temple was that of a memorial temple to the king seti i as well as reverence of the early pharaohs which is incorporated within as part of the rite of the ancestors the long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties—recognized by seti—are carved on a wall and known as the  showing the  name of many dynastic pharaohs of egypt from the first  or  until his time  with the exception of those noted above there were significant names deliberately left out of the list so rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names the table of abydos re discovered by  has been called the rosetta stone of egyptian archaeology analogous to the  for egyptian writing beyond the  name autogenerated1misty cryer travellers in egypt   william john bankes 2006 travellersinegyptorg web http  wwwtravellersinegyptorg archives 2004 10 william_john_bankeshtml travegypt wjb re discovered table of abydos

acacia   or  known commonly as mimosa acacia thorntree or wattle name carr  is a  genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the   of the family  it was described by the  botanist  in 1773 based on the n species  many non australian species tend to be  whereas the majority of n acacias are not all species are  bearing with sap and leaves often bearing large amounts of s and s that historically found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives
the genus acacia constitutes in its traditional circumspection the second largest genus in fabaceae name thie   being the largest with roughly 1300  about 960 of them native to australia with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm  regions of both hemispheres including  africa southern  and the  see  the genus was divided into five separate genera under the tribe  the genus  represents the majority of the australian species and a few native to southeast asia  and  most of the species outside australia and a small number of australian species are classified into  and  the two final genera  and  each contain about a dozen species from the americas but see  below for the ongoing debate concerning their taxonomy
this article describes acacias in the broader sense
english botanist and gardener  adopted the name acacia in 1754 the generic name derives from   the name given by early greek botanist physician  middle to late first century to the medicinal tree  in his book   this name derives from the  word for its characteristic thorns   thorn  the species name nilotica was given by linnaeus from this trees best known range along the  river this became the  of the genus
the traditional circumscription of acacia eventually contained approximately 1300 species however evidence began to accumulate that the genus as described was not  queensland botanist les pedley proposed the subgenus phyllodineae be renamed  and published the binomial names name maslin  name bol  this was taken up in new zealand but generally not followed in australia where botanists declared more study was needed
 
eventually consensus emerged that acacia needed to be split as it was not monophyletic this led to australian botanists  and tony orchard pushing for the retypification of the genus with an australian species instead of the original african type species an exception to traditional rules of priority that required ratification by the international botanical congress name smith  that decision has been controversial name thie  name kull  and debate continues with some taxonomists and many other biologists deciding to continue to use the traditional acacia sensu lato circumscription of the genus name smith  in defiance of decisions by two consecutive international botanical congresses   when the genus is divided the traditional acacias of africa resort under genera  and  some of the american species are placed in  and  and the majority of species in genus  are confined to australia name acacia 
in common parlance the term acacia is occasionally applied to species of the genus  which also belongs in the  family  an american species locally known as black locust is sometimes called false acacia in  in the  and throughout europe
acacias in australia probably evolved their fire resistance about 20 million years ago when fossilised charcoal deposits show a large increase indicating that fire was a factor even then with no major mountain ranges or rivers to prevent their spread the wattles began to spread all over the continent as it dried and fires became more common they began to form dry open forests with species of the genera   and  cypress pines
the southernmost species in the genus are  silver wattle  coast wattle or sydney golden wattle  black wattle and  blackwood reaching 43°30 s in  australia
australian species are usually called wattles while african and american species tend to be known as acacias
the leaves of acacias are compound  in general in some species however more especially in the australian and  species the leaflets are suppressed and the leaf stalks  become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves these are known as s the vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves a few species such as  lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess  modified leaf like  stems functioning as leaves
the small flowers have five very small petals almost hidden by the long  and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters they are yellow or cream colored in most species whitish in some or even purple acacia purpureopetala or red  scarlet blaze acacia flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus  by their stamens which are not joined at the base also unlike individual  flowers those of acacia have more than ten stamens

in the  bullthorn acacias—  and  — some of the spiny stipules are large swollen and hollow these afford shelter for several species of  ants which feed on extra floral nectaries on the leaf stalk and small  rich food bodies at the tips of the leaflets called  in return the s add protection to the plant against s  some species of ants will also remove competing plants around the acacia cutting off the offending plants leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing them other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts
similar mutualisms with ants occur on acacia trees in africa such as the  acacia the acacias provide shelter for ants in similar swollen stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants such as crematogaster mimosae in turn the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem boring beetles that damage the plant

over 100000 american teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and s throughout mexico over  each year name stategov  the main reason students head to mexico is the 18 year old drinking age versus 21 for the united states something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean this has become attractive since the 1990s especially since more traditional spring break places such as  have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors this legislation has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of mexico with acapulco as one of the top destinations name leinwand 
in the late 1990s and early 2000s  had been favored as the spring break destination of choice however cancún has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event and students have been looking for someplace new this has led many more to choose acapulco in spite of the fact that for many travelers the flight is longer and more expensive than to cancún many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and acapulcos famous nightlife name msnbc  in 2008 22500 students came to acapulco for spring break hotels did not get that many in 2009 due mostly to the economic situation in the united states name crisis  and partially because of scares of drug related violence name autogenerated1 
in february 2009 the us state department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to acapulco  the warning—a result of violent activity springing from mexicos drug cartel débâcle—took college campuses by storm with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to mexico over spring break the new york times tracked the travels of a penn student on spring break in acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email while  devoted a segment of his show  to urge students to stay away from acapulco  in june 2009 a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government these included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets involving large caliber weapons and grenades  however no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported
from the us many airlines now fly to  year round in the city there are many buses and  services one can take to get from place to place but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations however an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized colectivo cab system these cabs cost 13  per person to ride but they are not private the driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available and will transport them to their destination based on first come first served rules the colectivos each travel a designated area of the city the three main ones being costera colosio coloso or a mixture of the three coloso cabs travel mainly to old acapulco colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of acapulco costera cabs drive up and down the coast of acapulco where most of the hotels for visitors are located but which includes some of old acapulco where a driver will take you is partly his choice some are willing to travel to the other designated areas especially during slow periods of the day
the bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider as far as transportation goes it is the cheapest form other than walking in acapulco the most expensive buses have  while the cheaper buses do not for tourists the acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with acapulco painted on the side of them these buses are not for tourists only but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems these buses travel the tourist section of acapulco driving up and down the coast there are buses with specific routes and destinations generally written on their s or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized with decals and home made interior designs that range from comic book scenes to  and even to  themes

apl named after the book a programming language name aplbook  is a  developed in the 1960s by  its central datatype is the  it uses a large range of special graphic symbols  to represent most operators leading to very concise code it has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling s   and computer math packages name mworks   it has also inspired several other programming languages name jinsp   name kinsp   name qinsp   it is still used today for certain applications  name prod 
the  for manipulating arrays which developed into the apl programming language was developed by iverson at  starting in 1957 and published in his a programming language in 1962 name aplbook  
the pace states its premise
blockquoteapplied mathematics is largely concerned with the design and analysis of explicit procedures for calculating the exact or approximate values of various functions such explicit procedures are called algorithms or programs because an effective notation for the description of programs exhibits considerable syntactic structure it is called a programming language
 blockquote
in 1960 he began work for  and working with  created apl based on the notation he had developed this notation was used inside ibm for short research reports on computer systems such as the  and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus s were being evaluated by ibm for upcoming computers
also in 1960 iverson used his notation in a draft of the chapter a programming language written for a book he was writing with  automatic data processing which would be published in 1963iverson kenneth e http  wwwsoftwarepreservationorg projects apl book iverson automaticdataprocessing colorpdf view automatic data processing chapter 6 a programming language 1960 draft copy for brooks and iverson 1963 book automatic data processing  iverson kenneth 1963 automatic data processing john wiley amp sons inc 
as early as 1962 the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after falkoff discussed with dr william c carter his work in the standardization of the instruction set for the machines that later became the  family
in 1963 herbert hellerman working at the ibm systems research institute implemented a part of the notation on an  computer and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation students tested their code in hellermans lab this implementation of a portion of the notation was called pat personalized array translatorhellerman h experimental personalized array translator system communications of the acm 7 433 july 1964 
in 1963 falkoff iverson and  all working at ibm used the notation for a formal description of the  series machine architecture and functionality which resulted in a paper published in  in 1964 after this was published the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system one of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of john l lawrence who had new duties with  an educational company bought by ibm in 1964 lawrence asked iverson and his group to help utilize the language as a tool for the development and use of computers in educationfalkoff adin d iverson kenneth e http  wwwjsoftwarecom papers aplevolhtm the evolution of apl acm sigplan notices 13 1978 08 
after  and  of stanford university joined the team at ibm research they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in  for a portion of the notation which had been done for the  computer running under the  operating system this work was finished in late 1965 and later known as ivsys iverson system the basis of this implementation was described in detail by abrams in a stanford university technical report an interpreter for iverson notation in 1966abrams philip s http  infolabstanfordedu tr cs tr 66 47html an interpreter for iverson notation technical report cs tr 66 47 department of computer science stanford university august 1966  this was formally supervised by  like hellermans pat system earlier this implementation did not include the apl character set but used special english reserved words for functions and operators the system was later adapted for a  system and by november 1966 it had been reprogrammed for the  computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at ibmhaigh thomas biographies kenneth e iverson ieee annals of the history of computing 2005 
a key development in the ability to use apl effectively before the widespread use of  terminals was the development of a special  interchangeable typeball with all the special apl characters on it this was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism such as the  and  terminal keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which apl characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck for the first time a programmer could actually type in and see real apl characters as used in iversons notation and not be forced to use awkward english keyword representations of them falkoff and iverson had the special apl selectric typeballs 987 and 988 designed in late 1964 although no apl computer system was available to use them name aplqq91breed larry http  portalacmorg citationcfmid 138094140933 the first apl terminal session apl quote quad association for computing machinery volume 22 number 1 september 1991 p2 4  iverson cited falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an ibm selectric typeball for the apl character sethttp  wwwcomputerhistoryorg tdih setdate 19 12 2009 adin falkoff   computer history museum iverson credited him for choosing the name apl and the introduction of the ibm golf ball typewriter with the replacement typehead which provided the famous character set to represent programs 
some apl symbols even with the apl characters on the typeball still had to be typed in by over striking two existing typeball characters an example would be the grade up character which had to be made from a delta shift h and a  shift m this was necessary because the apl character set was larger than the 88 characters allowed on the selectric typeball
the first apl interactive login and creation of an apl workspace was in 1966 by larry breed using an ibm 1050 terminal at the ibm mohansic labs near  the home of apl in  name aplqq91 
ibm was chiefly responsible for the introduction of apl to the marketplace apl was first available in 1967 for the  as apl\1130 http  bitsaversorg pdf ibm 1130 lang 1130 033001_apl_1130_may69pdf apl\1130 manual may 1969  it would run in as little as 8k 16 bit words of memory and used a dedicated 1 megabyte hard disk
apl gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late 1960s through the early 1980s in part because it would run on lower specification systems that were not equipped with  hardware  additional improvements in performance for selected  mainframe systems included the apl assist microcode in which some support for apl execution was included in the actual firmware as opposed to apl being exclusively a software product somewhat later as suitably performing hardware was finally becoming available in the mid  to late 1980s many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment
early ibm apl interpreters for ibm 360 and ibm 370 hardware implemented their own multi user management instead of relying on the host services thus they were timesharing systems in their own right first introduced in 1966 the apl\360 name ibm apl\360 1968falkoff adin iverson kenneth e http  bitsaversorg pdf ibm apl apl_360_users_manual_aug68pdf apl\360 users guide ibm research thomas j watson research center yorktown heights ny august 1968 http  bitsaversorg pdf ibm apl apl_360_terminal_system_mar67pdf apl\360 terminal system ibm research thomas j watson research center march 1967  name apl360  system was a multi user interpreter the ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged i beam functions using both  and  operationsfalkoff adin d iverson kenneth ehttp  wwwresearchibmcom journal rd 174 ibmrd1704fpdf the design of apl ibm journal of research and development volume 17 number 4 july 1973 these environmental defined functions were based on the use of still another class of functions—called i beams because of the shape of the symbol used for them—which provide a more general facility for communication between apl programs and the less abstract parts of the system the i beam functions were first introduced by the system programmers to allow them to execute system 360 instructions from within apl programs and thus use apl as a direct aid in their programming activity the obvious convenience of functions of this kind which appeared to be part of the language led to the introduction of the monadic i beam function for direct use by anyone various arguments to this function yielded information about the environment such as available space and time of day 
in 1973 ibm released aplsv which was a continuation of the same product but which offered s as a means to access facilities outside of the apl system such as operating system files in the mid 1970s the ibm mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the  desktop computer which had a small crt and an apl keyboard when most other small computers of the time only offered  in the 1980s the vsapl program product enjoyed widespread usage with     and  users
in 1973 1974 dr patrick e hagerty directed the implementation of the university of maryland apl interpreter for the  series mainframe computers  at the time sperry had nothing in 1974 student alan stebbens was assigned the task of implementing an internal function 
several timesharing firms sprang up in the 1960s and 1970s that sold apl services using modified versions of the ibm apl\360 name apl360   interpreter in north america the better known ones were    tsr and  tcc compuserve also entered the fray in 1978 with an apl interpreter based on a modified version of digital equipment corp and carnegie mellons which ran on decs ki and kl 36 bit machines compuserves apl was available both to its commercial market and the consumer information service  with the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the  and later the personal computer the timesharing industry had all but disappeared by the mid 1980s
sharp apl was available from  first on a timesharing basis in the 1960s and later as a program product starting around 1979 sharp apl was an advanced apl implementation with many language extensions such as packages the ability to put one or more objects into a single variable file system nested arrays and s
apl interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini computer manufacturers as well notably         and others

starting in the early 1980s ibm apl development under the leadership of dr  implemented a new version of the apl language that contained as its primary enhancement the concept of nested arrays where an array can contain other arrays as well as new language features which facilitated the integration of nested arrays into program workflow ken iverson no longer in control of the development of the apl language left ibm and joined  where one of his major contributions was directing the evolution of sharp apl to be more in accordance with his vision   
as other vendors were busy developing apl interpreters for new hardware notably  based s apl2 was almost always the standard chosen for new apl interpreter developments even today most apl vendors or their users cite apl2 compatibility as a selling point for those products  
apl2 for ibm mainframe computers is still available  ibm cites its use for problem solving system design prototyping engineering and scientific computations expert systems  for teaching mathematics and other subjects visualization and database access  and was first available for  and  in 1984  the apl2 workstation edition windows os 2 aix linux and solaris followed much later in the early 1990s

in the early 1980s the analogic corporation developed the apl machine which was an  computer designed to be programmed only in apl there were actually three processing units the users workstation an  where programs were entered and edited a  processor that ran the apl interpreter and the analogic array processor that executed the primitiveshttp  groupsyahoocom group apl l message 8180yahoo group apl l april 2003  at the time of its introduction the apl machine was likely the fastest apl system available although a technological success the apl machine was a marketing failure the initial version supported a single process at a time at the time the project was discontinued the design had been completed to allow multiple users as an aside an unusual aspect of the apl machine was that the library of workspaces was organized such that a single function or variable that was shared by many workspaces existed only once in the library several of the members of the apl machine project had previously spent a number of years with burroughs implementing apl\700
at one stage it was claimed by bill gates in his   planned to release a version of apl but these plans never materialized

various implementations of apl by aplx dyalog et al include extensions for  support for  xml array conversion primitives graphing operating system interfaces and 
unlike traditionally structured programming languages apl code is typically structured as chains of  or   and  name microaol_operators   acting on   apl has many nonstandard primitives functions and operators that are indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols all primitives are defined to have the same  and always associate to the right hence apl is read or best understood from 
early apl implementations circa 1970 or so did not have programming loop  such as do or while loops and if then else constructions instead they used array operations and use of  constructs was often not necessary since an operation could be carried out on an entire array in a single statement for example the iota function ι can replace for loop  ιn when applied to a scalar positive integer yields a one dimensional array vector 1 2 3  n more recent implementations of apl generally include comprehensive control structures so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated
the apl environment is called a workspace in a workspace the user can define programs and data ie the data values exist also outside the programs and the user can also manipulate the data without having to define a program  for example

apl is well known for its use of a set of non  symbols which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation having single character names for  vector functions is one way that apl enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing  in one line of code  in nearly all versions of apl it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression that is in one line of code

advocates of apl claim that the examples of so called write only code badly written and almost incomprehensible code are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes which can occur in any language advocates of apl also claim that they are far more productive with apl than with more conventional computer languages and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology apl lets an individual solve harder problems faster
they also may claim that because it is compact and terse apl lends itself well to larger scale software development and complexity because the number of lines of code can be dramatically reduced many apl advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as  and  as being comparatively tedious apl is often found where time to market is important such as with trading systems

gnu apl is a free implementation of iso standard 13751 and hence similar to apl2 it runs on gnu linux and on windows using  it uses  internally gnu apl was written by jürgen sauermann
apl programs are normally  and less often  in reality most apl compilers  source apl to a lower level language such as  leaving the machine specific details to the lower level compiler compilation of apl programs was a frequently discussed topic in conferences although some of the newer enhancements to the apl language such as nested arrays have rendered the language increasingly difficult to compile the idea of apl compilation is still under development today
in the past apl compilation was regarded as a means to achieve execution speed comparable to other mainstream languages especially on mainframe computers several apl compilers achieved some levels of success though comparatively little of the development effort spent on apl over the years went to perfecting compilation into machine code
as is the case when moving apl programs from one vendors apl interpreter to another apl programs invariably will require changes to their content depending on the compiler variable declarations might be needed certain language features would need to be removed or avoided or the apl programs would need to be cleaned up in some way some features of the language such as the execute function an expression evaluator and the various  and  functions from apl such as the ability to return a functions text or to materialize a new function from text are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation
a commercial compiler was brought to market by  in the mid 1980s as an add on to ibms vsapl program product unlike more modern apl compilers this product produced machine code that would execute only in the interpreter environment it was not possible to eliminate the interpreter component the compiler could compile many scalar and vector operations to machine code but it would rely on the apl interpreters services to perform some more advanced functions rather than attempt to compile them however dramatic speedups did occur especially for heavily iterative apl code
around the same time the book an apl compiler by  appeared in print this book detailed the construction of an apl translator written in  which performed certain optimizations such as  specific to the needs of an array language the source language was apl like in that a few rules of the apl language were changed or relaxed to permit more efficient compilation the translator would emit c code which could then be compiled and run outside of the apl workspace
the burroughs unisys aplb interpreter 1982 was the first to use   compilation to produce code for an apl specific  it recompiled on the fly as identifiers changed their functional meanings in addition to removing  and some error checking from the main execution path such compilation also streamlines the repeated entry and exit of user defined functional operands this avoids the stack setup and take down for function calls made by apls built in operators such as reduce and each
apex a research apl compiler is available under the  per snake island research inc apex compiles flat apl a subset of iso n8485 into  a functional array language with parallel semantics and currently runs under  apex generated code uses  and array contraction special case algorithms not generally available to interpreters eg upgrade of  to achieve a level of performance comparable to that of 
the aplnext visualapl system is a departure from a conventional apl system in that visualapl is a true net language which is fully interoperable with other net languages such as  and  visualapl is inherently object oriented and unicode based while visualapl incorporates most of the features of standard apl implementations the visualapl language extends standard apl to be net compliant visualapl is hosted in the standard microsoft visual studio ide and as such invokes compilation in a manner identical to that of other net languages by producing  cil code it utilizes the microsoft just in time compiler jit to support 32 bit or 64 bit hardware substantial performance speed ups over standard apl have been reported especially when optional strong typing of function arguments is used
an apl to  translator is available from causeway graphical systems this product was designed to allow the apl code translated to equivalent c# to run completely outside of the apl environment the causeway compiler requires a run time library of array functions some speedup sometimes dramatic is visible but happens on account of the optimisations inherent in microsofts net framework
apl was unique in the speed with which it could perform complicated matrix operations for example a very large matrix multiplication would take only a few seconds on a machine that was much less powerful than those today   and because it operates on arrays and performs operations like matrix inversion internally well written apl can be surprisingly fast   there were both technical and economic reasons for this advantage
 commercial interpreters delivered highly tuned linear algebra library routines
 very low interpretive overhead was incurred per array—not per element
 apl response time compared favorably to the runtimes of early optimizing compilers
 ibm provided  assist for apl on a number of ibm370 mainframes
phil abrams much cited paper an apl machine illustrated how apl could make effective use of  where calculations would not actually be performed until the results were needed and then only those calculations strictly required an obvious and easy to implement lazy evaluation is the j vector when a monadic iota is encountered in the code it is kept as a representation instead of being expanded in memory in future operations a j vectors contents are the loops induction register not reads from memory
although such techniques were not widely used by commercial interpreters they exemplify the languages best survival mechanism not specifying the order of scalar operations or the exact contents of memory as standardized in 1983 by   x3j10 apl remains highly  this gives language implementers immense freedom to schedule operations as efficiently as possible as computer innovations such as  and  execution became commercially available apl programs are ported with almost no extra effort spent re optimizing low level details
apl makes a clear distinction between functions and operators name microaol_operators    functions take arrays variables or constants or expressions as arguments and return arrays as results operators similar to s take functions or arrays as arguments and derive related functions for example the sum function is derived by applying the reduction operator to the addition function applying the same reduction operator to the maximum function which returns the larger of two numbers derives a function which returns the largest of a group vector of numbers in the j language iverson substituted the terms verb for function  and adverb or conjunction for  operator
apl also identifies those features built into the language and represented by a symbol or a fixed combination of symbols as primitives most primitives are either functions or operators coding apl is largely a process of writing non primitive functions and in some versions of apl operators however a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators most noticeably assignment
some words used in apl literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science

a design theme in apl is to define default actions in some cases that would produce syntax errors in most other programming languages
the hello world string constant above displays because display is the default action on any expression for which no action is specified explicitly eg assignment function parameter
another example of this theme is that exponentiation in apl is written as  which indicates raising 2 to the power 3 this would be written as  in some other languages and  in fortran and python however if no base is specified as with the statement  in apl or  in other languages most other programming languages one would have a syntax error apl however assumes the missing base to be the natural logarithm constant  271828 and so interpreting  as

the above does a lot concisely although it seems complex to a beginning apler  it combines the following apl functions also called primitives  and glyphs 
 the first to be executed apl executes from rightmost to leftmost is dyadic function  named deal when dyadic that returns a  consisting of a select number left argument 6 in this case of random integers ranging from 1 to a specified maximum right argument 40 in this case which if said maximum ≥ vector length is guaranteed to be non repeating thus generate create 6 random integers ranging from 1 40 
 this vector is then assigned code← code to the variable x because it is needed later
 this vector is then sorted in ascending order by a monadic ⍋ function which has as its right argument everything to the right of it up to the next unbalanced close bracket or close parenthesis the result of ⍋ is the indices that will put its argument into ascending order
 then the output of ⍋ is applied to the variable x which we saved earlier and it puts the items of x into ascending sequence

apl has been both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique non standard character set some who learn it become ardent adherents suggesting that there is some weight behind iversons idea that the notation used does make a difference in the beginning there were few terminal devices and even display monitors that could reproduce the apl character set—the most popular ones employing the  print mechanism along with a special apl type element one of the early apl  line mode operation only not full screen   was the texas instruments ti model 745 circa 1977 with full apl character set  which featured  s modes for interacting with an apl  service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job 
over time with the universal use of high quality graphic displays printing devices and  support the apl character font problem has largely been eliminated however entering apl characters requires use of s keyboard mappings virtual on screen apl symbol sets   or easy erence printed keyboard cards which can frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages   
in defense of the apl community apl requires less coding to type in and keyboard mappings become memorized over time also special apl keyboards are manufactured and in use today as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating system platforms such as microsoft windowsdyalog inc apl fonts and keyboards http  wwwdyalogcom apl font keyboardhtm  the reported productivity gains assume that one will spend enough time working in apl to make memorization of the symbols their semantics and keyboard mappings worthwhile
apl has long had a select mathematically inclined and curiosity driven user base who erence its powerful and symbolic nature one symbol character can perform an entire sort another can perform regression for example it was and still is popular in financial pre modeling applications and insurance applications in simulations and in mathematical applications apl has been used in a wide variety of contexts and for many and varied purposes including artificial intelligence   and robotics   a newsletter titled quote quad dedicated to apl has been published since the 1970s by the sigapl section of the association for computing machinery quote quad is the name of the apl character used for text input and outputhttp  wwwsigaplorg qqhtm quote quad newsletter  
before the advent of full screen systems and until as late as the mid 1980s systems were written such that the user entered instructions in his own business specific vocabulary apl  vendors delivered applications in this form on the  timesharing system a workspace called 39 magic offered access to financial and airline data plus sophisticated for the time graphing and reporting another example is the graphpak workspace supplied with ibms apl then apl2
because of its matrix operations apl was for some time quite popular for computer graphics programming where graphic transformations could be encoded as matrix multiplications one of the first commercial computer graphics houses  based in new york city produced an apl graphics product known as visions which was used to create television commercials and reportedly animation for the 1982 film  digital effects use of apl was informally described at a number of sigapl conferences in the late 1980s examples discussed included the early uk  tv logo ident
interest in apl has declined from a peak in the mid 1980s this appears partly due to lack of smooth migration pathways from higher performing memory intensive mainframe implementations to low cost personal computer alternatives   apl implementations for computers before the  released in the late 1980s were only suitable for small applications another important reason for the decline is the lack of  low cost standardized and robust compiled apl executables   usable across multiple computer hardware and os platforms there are several apl version permutations across various apl implementations particularly differences between ibms apl2 and apl2000s apl+ versions another practical limitation is that apl has fallen behind modern integrated computing environments with respect to debugging capabilities or test driven development consequently while apl remains eminently suitable for small to medium sized programs productivity gains for larger projects involving teams of developers would be questionable
the growth of end user computing tools such as  and  has indirectly eroded potential apl usage these are frequently appropriate platforms for what may have been apl applications in the 1970s and 1980s some apl users migrated to the  which offers some advanced features lastly the decline was also due in part to the growth of   and  these scientific computing array oriented platforms provide an interactive computing experience similar to apl but more closely resemble conventional programming languages such as fortran and use standard ascii other apl users continue to wait for a very low cost standardized broad hardware usable apl implementation  
notwithstanding this decline apl finds continued use in certain fields such as accounting research pre hardcoded modeling dna identification technology   symbolic mathematical expression and learning it remains an inspiration to its current user base as well as for other languages 
apl has been standardized by the   x3j10 and   joint technical committee 1 subcommittee 22 working group 3 the core apl language is specified in iso 84851989 and the extended apl language is specified in iso iec 137512001

algol short for algorithmic languagethe name of the family is sometimes given in mixed case http  wwwmasswerkat algol60 reporthtm algol 60 and sometimes in all uppercase http  wwwcsrunl ~hubbers courses sl1 rrpdf algol68 for simplicity this article uses algol  is a family of  computer s originally developed in the mid 1950s which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for  description used by the  in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty yearshttp  calgoacmorg  collected algorithms of the acm compressed archives of the algorithms  
in the sense that most modern languages are algol like  it was arguably the most successful of the four high level programming languages with which it was roughly contemporary   and  it was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with   using uppercase name because of the sentential context   and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages including      and  algol introduced code blocks and the codebegin code…codeend code pairs for delimiting them it was also the first language implementing  definitions with  moreover it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the  introduced  a principal notation for language design
there were three major specifications
  – originally proposed to be called ial for international algebraic language
  – first implemented as x1 algol 60 in mid 1960 – revised 1963  
  – revised 1973 name a68  – introduced new elements including flexible arrays slices parallelism operator identification and various extensibility features
 based his own  on algol 60 before developing  algol w for the ibm 360 was based on the proposal for the next generation algol but the algol 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified algol 60 the official algol versions are named after the year they were first published
algol 68 is substantially different from algol 60 and was not well received so that in general algol means algol 60 and dialects thereof  fragments of algol like  are sometimes still used as 
the  ial was extremely influential and generally considered the ancestor of most of the modern programming languages the so called algol like languages additionally in  algol object code was a simple and compact and stack based  mainly used in teaching  construction and other high order languages of which algol is generally considered the first
algol was developed jointly by a committee of european and american computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at  cf  it specified three different syntaxes a erence syntax a publication syntax and an implementation syntax the different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points commas vs periods for different languages
algol was used mostly by research computer scientists in the united states and in europe its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than  algol 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development
 developed the  method of describing programming languages specifically for algol 58 it was revised and expanded by  for algol 60 and at s suggestion renamed  
peter naur as editor of the algol bulletin i was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the european language design group in november 1959 in this capacity i was the editor of the algol 60 report produced as the result of the algol 60 meeting in paris in january 1960 name naur_acmhttp  awardsacmorg citationcfmid 1024454ampsrt allampaw 140ampao amturingampyr 2005 acm award citation   peter naur 2005 
the following people attended the meeting in paris from  1 to 16 january
       and  from europe
      and  from the usa
alan perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting the meetings were exhausting interminable and exhilarating one became aggravated when ones good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others nevertheless diligence persisted during the entire period the chemistry of the 13 was excellent
algol 60 inspired many languages that followed it  remarked here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successorshttp  wwweecsumichedu ~bchandra courses papers hoare_hintspdf hints on programming language design car hoare december 1973 page 27 this statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to  also involved in implementing the first algol 60    the  programming language a variant of  that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of algol also adopted the wording revised report on the algorithmic language scheme for its standards documents in homage to algol name r3rs 
as  noted the language algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the call by name  perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to  and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity reynoldss idealized algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call by name languages to be contrasted with the global effects used by call by value languages such as  the conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research along with  and ml and  1996 algol like languages birkhauser boston inc cambridge ma usa 
to date there have been at least 70 augmentations extensions derivations and sublanguages of algol 60

algol 60 as officially defined had no  facilities implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other in contrast algol 68 offered an extensive library of transput algol 68 parlance for input output facilities
algol 60 allowed for two  for  passing the common  and  call by name has certain effects in contrast to  for example without specifying the parameters as value or erence it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable section 75 and erences therein  think of passing a pointer to swapi ai in to a function now that every time swap is erenced its reevaluated say i   1 and ai   2 so every time swap is erenced itll return the other combination of the values 12 21 12 and so on a similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument
call by name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting s that are used to implement it  devised the  to separate compilers that correctly implemented  and non local erences this test contains an example of call by name
algol 68 was defined using a two level grammar formalism invented by  and which bears his name s use a  to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular algol 68 program notably they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled semantics and have to be expressed in ambiguity prone natural language prose and then implemented in compilers as ad hoc code attached to the formal language parser

the variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic 
 
algol 58 had no i o facilities
 
since algol 60 had no i o facilities there is no portable  in algol

   replace e by hello world
   writef  e
 end
a simpler program using an inline format
 begin
   file fkind remote
   writef hello world
 end
an even simpler program using the display statement
 begin displayhello world end
an alternative example using elliott algol i o is as follows  elliott algol used different characters for open string quote and close string quote
  program hifolks
  begin
     print ‘hello world’
  end
heres a version for the elliott 803 algol a104 the standard elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case  the code lacked any quote characters so £ uk pound sign was used for open quote and  question mark for close quote  special sequences were placed in double quotes eg ££l produced a new line on the teleprinter
   hifolks
   begin
      print £hello world£l
   end
the  algol i o version allowed input from paper tape or punched card  paper tape full mode allowed lower case  output was to a line printer the open and close quote characters were represented using  and  and spaces by % 
   begin
      write texthello%world
   end
 
algol 68 code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase but bolded or underlined
 begin
   printfglhello world
 end
in the language of the algol 68 report the input output facilities were collectively called the 
the algols were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly also the algols were defined so that only uppercase letters were required
1960  – the algol 60 language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems but unfortunately were not supported on most computing systems at the time for instance × ÷ ≤ ≥ ≠ ¬ ∨ ∧ ⊂ ≡ ␣ and ⏨
1961 september asciiampnbsp– the  character set then in an early stage of development had the  back slash character added to it in order to support algols  operators  and http  wwwbobbemercom bacslashhtm how ascii got its backslash bob bemer 
1962  – this character set included the unusual amp#x16ed    ᛭    iron runic crosshttp  wwwfileformatinfo info unicode char 16ed indexhtm  character and the ⏨ decimal exponent symbol name unicode1http  unicodeorg charts pdf u2300pdf  for floating point notation   lower 10 has no  51 equivalent      
1964  – the 1964 soviet standard  allowed the encoding of 4 bit 5 bit 6 bit and 7 bit characters in algol 
1968 the algol 68 report – used existing algol characters and further adopted → ↓ ↑ □ ⌊ ⌈ ⎩ ⎧ ○ ⊥ and ¢ characters which can be found on the  keyboard with golf ball print heads inserted such as the  golfball these became available in the mid 1960s while algol 68 was being drafted  the report was translated into russian german french and bulgarian and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets eg  alphabet of the soviet  all algols characters are also part of the  standard and most of them are available in several popular s

awk is an   designed for text processing and typically used as a  and reporting tool it is a standard feature of most  s
the awk language is a   consisting of a set of actions to be taken against  of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a  – for purposes of extracting or transforming text such as producing formatted reports the language extensively uses the   s that is arrays indexed by key strings and s while awk has a limited intended  and was especially designed to support s the language is  and even the early bell labs users of awk often wrote well structured large awk programs 
awk was created at  in the 1970shttp  citeseerxistpsuedu viewdoc summarydoi 1011311299 awk    a pattern scanning and processing language second edition 1978  and its name is derived from the s of its authors –   and  the acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird  which acts as an emblem of the language such as on https  booksgooglecom booksid 53ueqgaacaajampdq the+awk+programming+languageamphl enampsa xampei lxxxvfq0gmossawrpoc4bgampved 0ccyq6aewaa the awk programming language book cover – the book is often erred to by the abbreviation tapl when written in all lowercase letters as codeawk code it ers to the  or  program that runs scripts written in the awk programming language
awk was initially developed in 1977 by   and  from whose initials the language takes it name as one of the early tools to appear in  awk added computational features to a unix  besides the  the only scripting language available in a standard unix environment it is one of the mandatory utilities of the http  wwwunixorg version3 apis cuhtml the single unix specification version 3 utilities interface table  and is required by the  specificationhttp  specsfreestandardsorg lsb_400 lsb core generic lsb core generic commandhtml#aen32008 linux standard base core specification 40 chapter 15 commands and utilities 
awk was significantly revised and expanded in 1985–88 resulting in the  implementation written by   and  released in 1988 name robbins  gnu awk is the most widely deployed version because it is included with gnu based linux packages gnu awk has been maintained solely by  since 1994 name robbins  s  new awk source was first released in 1993 unpublicized and publicly since the late 1990s many bsd systems use it to avoid gpl license name robbins 
awk was preceded by  1974 both were designed for text processing they share the line oriented data driven paradigm and are particularly suited to writing s due to the implicit  and current line variables the power and terseness of early awk programs – notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables which facilitate one liners – together with the limitations of awk at the time were important inspirations for the  language 1987 in the 1990s perl became very popular competing with awk in the niche of unix text processing languages
blockquote
awk is a language for processing text files a file is treated as a sequence of records and by default each line is a record each line is broken up into a sequence of fields so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field the second word as the second field and so on an awk program is of a sequence of pattern action statements awk reads the input a line at a time a line is scanned for each pattern in the program and for each pattern that matches the associated action is executed   alfred v ahohttp  wwwcomputerworldcomau indexphp id1726534212pp2 the a z of programming languages awk 
 blockquote
an awk program is a series of pattern action pairs written as
source lang awk
condition { action }
 source
where condition is typically an expression and action is a series of commands the input is split into records where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines the program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn and executes the action for each expression that is true either the condition or the action may be omitted the condition defaults to matching every record the default action is to print the record this is the same pattern action structure as sed
in addition to a simple awk expression such as codefoo  awk commands  sample applications  1 nr % 4  1 is true for the 1st 5th 9th etc lines of input likewise nr % 4  1 { # the pattern was the only thing so force read from standard input used by book
        argc   2
        argv1    
    }
}
0 ~ pattern { print filename  0 }
 source
the codebegin code is necessary not only to extract the first argument but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the codebegin code block ends codeargc code the number of arguments is always guaranteed to be ≥1 as codeargv0 code is the name of the command that executed the script most often the string codeawk code also note that codeargvargc code is the empty string code code code# code initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line
note the codeif code block awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command this means that
 awk prog
only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before codeprog code is run if you explicitly set codeargc code to 1 so that there are no arguments awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files theore you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename code  code
on unix like operating systems self contained awk scripts can be constructed using the  syntax
for example a script called codehelloawk code that prints the string hello world may be built by creating a file named codehelloawk code containing the following lines
source lang awk
# usr bin awk  f
begin { print hello world }
 source
the code f code tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from which is the same flag that is used in sed both these programs default to executing a program given as a command line argument rather than a separate file – since they are often used for one liners – though most other interpreted languages default to reading a program from a file

in  asgard  enclosure of the  name lindow  is one of the  and home to the  tribe of  it is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a  riding the   according to   and his wife  are the rulers of asgard
one of asgards well known locations is  valhalla in which odin rules
the primary sources regarding asgard come from the  written in the 13th century by ic  and the  compiled in the 13th century from a basis of much older 
 the first poem of the work mentions many of the features and characters of asgard portrayed by snorri such as  and 
the  presents two views regarding asgard
 
in the prologue snorri offers an  and christian influenced interpretation of the myths and tales of his foathers as gard he conjectures is the home of the Æsir singular Ás in as ia making a  connection between the three as  that is the Æsir were men of asia not gods who moved from asia to the north and some of which intermarried with the peoples already there snorris interpretation of the 13th century foreshadows 20th century views of  migration from the east
snorri further writes that asgard is a land more fertile than any other blessed also with a great abundance of gold and jewels correspondingly the Æsir excelled beyond all other people in strength beauty and talent
snorri proposes the location of asgard as  the center of the earth about it were 12 kingdoms and 12 chiefs one of them múnón married s daughter tróán and had by her a son trór to be pronounced  in  the latter was raised in  at age 12 he was whiter than ivory had hair lighter than gold and could lift 10 bear skins at once he explored far and wide his father odin led a migration to the northern lands where they took wives and had many children populating the entire north with aesir one of the sons of odin was  founder of the  an early royal family of 
 
in  snorri presents the mythological version taken no doubt from his sources icelanders were still being converted at that time he could not present the myths as part of any current belief instead he resorts to a debunking device gylfi king of sweden before the Æsir travels to asgard and finds there a large hall  in section 2
within are three officials whom gylfi in the guise of gangleri is allowed to question about the asgard and the Æsir a revelation of the ancient myths follows but at the end the palace and the people disappear in a clap of thunder and gylfi finds himself alone on the plain having been deluded section 59
in gylfis delusion ancient asgard was ruled by the senior god the all father who had twelve names he was the ruler of everything and the creator of heaven and earth section 3 during a complex creation myth in which the cosmic cow licked  free from the ice the sons of buris son  who were   constructed the universe and put  in it as a residence for the first human couple  whom they created from driftwood trees in section 9
the sons of bor then constructed asgard to be identified with troy snorri insists in section 9 as a home for the Æsir who were divinities odin is identified as the all father asgard is conceived as being on the earth a rainbow bridge   connects it to heaven section 13 in asgard also is a temple for the 12 gods  and another for the 12 goddesses  the plain of  is the centre of asgard section 14
the gods hold court there every day at the  beneath an ash tree  debating the fates of men and gods the more immediate destinies of men are assigned by the  section 15 it also states thor is a god as well
long descriptions of the gods follow among the more memorable details are the  the battle maidens whom odin sends to allot death or victory to soldiers section 37 names 13 valkyries and states that the source as the poetic edda poem  odins residence is  to which he takes those slain in battle the  section 20 snorri quips there is a huge crowd there and there will be many more still  section 39 they amuse themselves every day by fighting each other and then going to drink in the big hall
toward the end of the chapter snorri becomes prophetic describing  the twilight of the gods much of it sounds like the  by which snorri a christian can hardly fail to have been influenced it will begin with three winters of snow with no summers in between wars will follow then earthquakes and tidal waves the sky will split open and out will ride the sons of  intent on universal destruction they will try to enter heaven but bifröst will break section 55  will blow his mighty horn gjöll and the Æsir and einherjar will ride out to battle most of the Æsir will die and asgard be destroyed snorri quotes his own source saying the sun will go black earth sink in the sea heaven be stripped of its bright stars section 56
afterwards the earth rises again from the sea is fairer than before and where asgard used to be a remnant of the Æsir gather some coming up from  and talk and play chess all day with the golden chessmen of the ancient Æsir which they find in the grass section 58
 
the 10th century skald  is quoted in  as stating
blockquote
thor has defended asgard and  odins people the gods with strength name lindow 
 blockquote
 
by the time of the  snorri had developed his concept of asgard further although the differences might be accounted for by his sources in the initial stanzas of the poem asagarth is the capital of asaland a section of asia to the east of the tana kvísl or vana kvísl river kvísl is fork which snorri explains is the  or  flowing into the  the river divides sweden the great a concession to the  point of view it is never called that prior to the vikings section 1
the river lands are occupied by the  and are called vanaland or vanaheim it is unclear what people snorri thinks the vanes are whether the proto   or the east germanic  who had been in that region at that time for well over 1000 years he does not say however the germanic names of the characters such as njord frey and vanlandi indicate he had the vandals in mind
odin is the chief of asagarth from there he conducts and dispatches military expeditions to all parts of the world he has the virtue of never losing a battle section 2 when he is away his two brothers  rule asaland from asagarth
on the border of sweden is a mountain range running from northeast to southwest south of it are the lands of the turks where odin had possessions thus the mountains must be the  on the north are the uninhabitable fells which must be the tundra taiga country apparently the vikings did not encounter the  or the s of the region snorri evidences no knowledge of them
there also is no mention of  which was not far from  capital of the  and militarily beyond the reach of the vikings troy cannot have been asagarth snorri realizes the reason being that the Æsir in asaland were unsettled by the military activities of the romans that is of the byzantine empire
as a result odin led a section of the Æsir to the north looking for new lands in which to settle they used the viking route up the don and the  through  viking  from there they went to saxland germany and to the lands of  in  section 5 the historical view of course is mainly fantastical the germanics were in germany and scandinavia during earliest mention of them in roman literature long before the romans had even conquered italy to what extent snorris presentation is poetic creation only remains unclear
demoted from his position as all father or king of the gods odin becomes a great sorcerer in the ynglinga saga he can shape shift speaks only in verse and lies so well that everything he says seems true he strikes enemies blind and deaf but when his own men fight they go   and cannot be harmed he has a ship that can be rolled up like a tablecloth when not used he relies on two talking ravens to gather intelligence and he consults the talking head of a dwarf for prophecy he carries it around long since detached from its body section 7
as a man however odin is faced with the necessity to die he is cremated and his possessions are burned with him so that he can ascend to   where if asgard is an earthly place not there snorri says at first it is valhalla and then adds the swedes now believed that he had gone to the old asagarth and would live there forever section 9 finally snorri resorts to heaven even though nothing in christianity advocates cremation and certainly the burning of possessions avails the christian nothing

the apollo program also known as project apollo was the third united states  program carried out by the  nasa which accomplished landing the first humans on the  from 1969 to 1972 first conceived during  as a three man spacecraft to follow the one man  which put the first americans in space apollo was later dedicated to  s national goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth by the end of the 1960s which he proposed in a may 25 1961 address to  project mercury was followed by the two man  1962–66 the first manned flight of apollo was in 1968
kennedys goal was accomplished on the  mission when astronauts  and  landed their  lm on july 20 1969 and walked on the lunar surface while  remained in  in the  csm and all three landed safely on earth on july 24 five subsequent apollo missions also landed s on the moon the last in december 1972 in these six spaceflights 
apollo ran from 1961 to 1972 and was supported by the two man  program which ran concurrently with it from 1962 to 1966 gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the apollo missions apollo used  as launch vehicles apollo saturn vehicles were also used for an  which consisted of  a  that supported three manned missions in 1973–74 and the  a joint earth orbit mission with the soviet union in 1975
the apollo program succeeded in achieving its goal of manned lunar landing despite the major setback of a 1967  cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a pre launch test after the first landing sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow on landings with a plan for extended lunar  and  exploration budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings but the  landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon which disabled the command spacecrafts propulsion and life support the crew returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as a lifeboat for these functions
apollo set several major  it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond   was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while the final  mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit the program returned  of lunar rocks and  to earth greatly contributing to the understanding of the moons composition and geological history the program laid the foundation for nasas current human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its  and  apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and  including  telecommunications and computers
the apollo program was conceived during the  administration in early 1960 as a follow up to  while the mercury  could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission apollo would carry three astronauts possible missions included ferrying crews to a  s  and eventual manned s the program was named after the  by nasa manager  who later said that i was naming the spacecraft like id name my baby p 55  silverstein chose the name at home one evening early in 1960 because he felt apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program name pressrelease 
in july 1960 nasa deputy administrator  announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of  conferences preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module piloting and re entry cabin and a propulsion and equipment module  on august 30 a feasibility study competition was announced and on october 25 three study contracts were awarded to   and the  name chariots_feasibility  meanwhile nasa performed its own in house spacecraft design studies led by  to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs name chariots_feasibility 
in november 1960 john f kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the  in the fields of  and  using aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige he warned of a  between the two nations pledging to make the us not first but first and first if but first period  despite kennedys rhetoric he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president he knew little about the technical details of the space program and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing pp 117–118  when kennedys newly appointed nasa administrator  requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency kennedy supported an acceleration of nasas large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue p 55 
on april 12 1961 soviet   became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union at a meeting of the us house  one day after gagarins flight many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up  kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news using to make a commitment on americas response to the soviets p 114 
on april 20 kennedy sent a memo to   asking johnson to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up name jfkmemo  http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history apollomon docshtm key apollo source documents  johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership name lbjmemo  http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history apollomon docshtm key apollo source documents  his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first name lbjmemo  
on may 25 1961 twenty days after the first us manned spaceflight  kennedy proposed the manned moon landing in a special message to the congress on urgent national needs
blockquotenow it is time to take longer strides   time for a great new american enterprise   time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earthbrbri believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important in the long range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish name special message   blockquote
at the time of kennedys proposal only one american had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and nasa had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit even some nasa employees doubted whether kennedys ambitious goal could be met pp 16–17  by 1963 kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint us ussr moon mission to eliminate duplication of effort 
with the clear goal of a manned landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights nasa had to hit the ground running and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of convair ge and martin and proceed with fagets command   service module design the mission module was now an unnecessary luxury they used fagets design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids
landing men on the moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity and the largest commitment of resources 24 billion ever made by any nation in peacetime at its peak the apollo program employed 400000 people and required the support of over 20000 industrial firms and universities 
nasa already had a head start on the manned landing with the july 1 1960 establishment of the  in alabama which was working on the design of heavy lift class  which would be required for apollo but two more major nasa centers had to be built to accommodate the program
it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of s  which had been directing the nations manned space program from nasas  so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center the  msc a site was chosen in  texas on land donated by  and administrator webb announced the conversion on september 19 1961 name tno 12  it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its  launch facilities in florida so a new  would be included in the msc
in september 1962 by which time two project mercury astronauts had orbited the earth gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in houston and construction of the msc facility was under way kennedy visited rice to reiterate his challenge in a 
blockquotebut why some say the moon why choose this as our goal and they may well ask why climb the highest mountain why 35 years ago fly the atlantic  br
we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win   name rice speech   blockquote
the msc was completed in september 1963 it was renamed by the us congress in honor of lyndon johnson soon after his death in 1973 
it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the  and  rockets at the northernmost end  and  but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission so land acquisition was started in july 1961 for a launch operations center loc immediately north of canaveral at  the design development and construction of the center was conducted by  a member of dr s original  engineering team debus was named the locs first director name nasa2  construction began in november 1962 upon kennedys death president johnson issued an executive order on november 29 1963 to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy 
the loc included  a  and a 130 million cubic foot 37 million cubic meter  vab in which the space vehicle launch vehicle and spacecraft would be assembled on a  and then moved by a  to one of several launch pads although at least three pads were planned only two designated a and b were completed in october 1965 the loc also included an  ocb to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two s capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to  which is nearly a vacuum  
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization so he recruited dr  for a high management job mueller accepted on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo webb then worked with associate administrator later deputy administrator  to reorganize the office of manned space flight omsf name secretofapollo  on july 23 1963 webb announced muellers appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight to replace then associate administrator  on his retirement effective september 1 under webbs reorganization the directors of the manned spacecraft center gilruth  von braun and the launch operations center debus effectively reported to mueller http  historynasagov sp 4206 p443htm appendix g   nasa organization during apollo saturn november 1963 p 443 
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high ranking officers in the  so he got webbs permission to recruit general  who gained a reputation for his effective management of the  program as omsf program controller phillips superior officer  agreed to loan phillips to nasa along with a staff of officers under him on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director mueller agreed and phillips managed apollo from january 1964 until it achieved the first manned landing in july 1969 after which he returned to air force duty 
    this probably completes this section the intent of which is to keep the narrative flow of webbs big 1963 reorganization these remainders should be highlighted probably as appropriate in later sections

once kennedy had defined a goal the apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life cost and demands on technology and astronaut skill four possible mission modes were considered
  the spacecraft would be launched as a unit and travel directly to the moon and land it would return leaving its landing stage on the moon this design would have required development of the extremely powerful  launch vehicle
  eor multiple rocket launches up to 15 in some plans would carry parts of a direct ascent spacecraft and propulsion units for  tli these would be assembled into a single spacecraft in earth orbit
  lor a single  could launch a spacecraft that was composed of a  which would remain in orbit around the moon while a smaller two stage  would carry two astronauts to the surface return to dock with the mother ship and then be discarded landing only a small part of the spacecraft on the moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the earth
 lunar surface rendezvous two spacecraft would be launched in succession the first an automated vehicle carrying propellant for the return to earth would land on the moon to be followed some time later by the manned vehicle propellant would have to be transferred from the automated vehicle to the manned vehicle
in early 1961 direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa many engineers feared that a rendezvous —let alone a docking— neither of which had been attempted even in  would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit dissenters including  at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach throughout 1960 and 1961 houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option bypassing the nasa hierarchy he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans while acknowledging that he spoke somewhat as a voice in the wilderness houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question chapter 34 http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history sp 4205 ch3 4html early reaction to lor p 71

space historian james hansen concludes that
the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen a 1964 msc study concluded the  as lifeboat  was finally dropped because no single reasonable  failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the letterman p 404 james lovell explosion on apollo 13 april 1970 from the earth to the moon and back lovell writes naturally im glad that view didnt prevail and im thankful that by the time of apollo 10 the first lunar mission carrying the lm the lm as a lifeboat was again being discussed  ironically just such a failure happened on  when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power the lunar module provided propulsion electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely name ksc apollo_13 
maxime fagets preliminary apollo design employed a cone shaped command module supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power sized appropriately for the space station cislunar and lunar landing missions once kennedys moon landing goal became official detailed design began of a command service module csm in which the crew would spend the entire direct ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip after being soft landed by a larger landing propulsion module the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csms role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew along with a new spacecraft the lunar excursion module lem later shortened to lunar module lm which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm name summaryreport  
the  cm was the conical crew cabin designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs its exterior was covered with an  and had its own  rcs engines to  and steer its  path parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown the module was  tall  in diameter and weighed approximately  name abtn_lv2 
a cylindrical  sm supported the command module with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants and a fuel cell power generation system with  and  reactants a high gain  antenna was used for long distance communications on the lunar flights on the extended lunar missions an orbital scientific instrument package was carried the service module was discarded just before re entry the module was  long and  in diameter the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately  fully fueled while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over  name abtn_lv2 
 won the contract to build the csm and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off of the moon and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight p 167  also there was no provision for docking with the lunar module a 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing while block ii the actual lunar spacecraft would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development name summaryreport 
the lunar module lm was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module not designed to fly through the earths atmosphere or return to earth its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages each with its own engine the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant surface stay consumables and surface exploration equipment the ascent stage contained the crew cabin ascent propellant and a reaction control system the initial lm model weighed approximately  and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours an extended lunar module weighed over  and allowed surface stays of over 3 days name abtn_lv2 http  historynasagov sp 4029 apollo_18 12_launch_vehicle spacecraft_key_factshtm launch vehicle spacecraft key facts   2nd table 
the contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded to  and the project was overseen by  
before the apollo program began wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles the  and the even larger  series in the midst of these plans von braun was transferred from the army to nasa and made director of the marshall space flight center the initial direct ascent plan to send the three man apollo command service module directly to the lunar surface on top of a large descent rocket stage would require a nova class launcher with a lunar payload capability of over  chapter 22 http  historynasagov sp 4206 ch2htm aerospace alphabet abma arpa msfc p 50  the june 11 1962 decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova and the msfc proceeded to develop the  for apollo chapter 3 http  historynasagov sp 4206 ch3htm missions modes and manufacturing p 60 
since apollo like mercury would require a  les in case of a launch failure a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system a size bigger than the naa  would be required so the  was built by   after an august 1963  p 14  four les test flights  through  were made at the  between may 1964 and january 1966 p 22 
   too big for some reason  
since apollo like project mercury used more than one launch vehicle for space missions nasa used spacecraft launch vehicle combination series numbers as 10x for saturn i as 20x for saturn ib and as 50x for saturn v compare   to designate and plan all missions rather than numbering them sequentially as in project gemini this was changed by the time manned flights began name missionnumbers  
saturn i the first us heavy lift launch vehicle was initially planned to launch partially equipped csms in low earth orbit tests the  first stage burned  with liquid oxygen lox oxidizer to produce  of thrust the  second stage used six liquid hydrogen fueled  engines with  of thrust a planned  s v third stage with two rl 10 engines never flew on saturn i p 85 see footnote 61 
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc 34 with only live first stages carrying dummy upper stages filled with water the first flight with a live s iv was launched from lc 37 this was followed by five launches of  csms designated  through  into orbit in 1964 and 1965 the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying  satellites which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of  impacts chapter 76 http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history sp 4205 ch7 6html portents for operations 
in september 1962 nasa planned to launch four manned csm flights on the saturn i from late 1965 through 1966 concurrent with project gemini the  payload capacity    original url for document on ntrs server http  ntrsnasagov archive nasa casintrsnasagov 19710065502_1971065502pdf      would have severely limited the systems which could be included so the decision was made in october 1963 to use the uprated  for all manned earth orbital flights 
the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i the  first stage increased the thrust to  and the second stage replaced the s iv with the  powered by a single  engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox to produce  of thrust a restartable version of the s ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v the saturn ib could send over  into low earth orbit sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm  saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as 200 series number as indicating apollo saturn and the 2 indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family
the three stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon it was  in diameter and stood  tall with its  lunar payload its capability grew to  for the later advanced lunar landings the  first stage burned rp 1 lox for a rated thrust of  which was upgraded to   the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen and the third stage was a modified version of the s ivb with thrust increased to  and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a  name abtn_lv1 http  historynasagov sp 4029 apollo_18 11_launch_vehicle spacecraft_key_factshtm launch vehicle spacecraft key facts   1st table

nasas director of flight crew operations during the apollo program was  one of the original  astronauts who was medically grounded in september 1962 due to a heart murmur slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments 
thirty two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the apollo program twenty four of these left earth’s orbit and flew around the moon between december 1968 and december 1972 three of them twice half of the 24 walked on its surface though none of them returned to the moon after landing once one of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist of the 32   and  were killed during a ground test in preparation for their apollo 1 mission name missionnumbers  
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans plus from two later astronaut groups all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans crews on all development flights except the earth orbit csm development flights through the first two landings on apollo 11 and  included at least two sometimes three gemini veterans dr  a geologist was the first  to fly in space and landed on the moon on the last mission apollo 17 schmitt participated in the  training of all of the apollo landing crews 
nasa awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor the  given for distinguished service ability or courage and personal contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom white and chaffee in 1969 then to the crews of all missions from  onward the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission    and  were awarded the lesser  because of discipline problems with the s orders during their flight the nasa administrator in october 2008 decided to award them the distinguished service medals by this time posthumously to schirra and eisele name apollo crew honored 2008

after apollo 12 placed the second of several s on the moon the s ivbs on subsequent missions were deliberately crashed on the moon instead of being sent to solar orbit as an active seismic experiment to induce vibrations in the moon
the first three lunar missions apollo 8  and apollo 11 used a  keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit which would allow a return to earth in case the sm engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change which required a course change maneuver soon after tli and eliminated the free return option
on later landing flights the sm engine was used instead of the lm engine to begin powered descent in order to allow a greater fuel reserve for landing
on apollo 12 and later missions the jettisoned lm ascent stages were deliberately crashed on the moon at known locations as another active seismic experiment the only exceptions to this were the apollo 13 lm which burned up in the earths atmosphere and  where a loss of  after jettison prevented making a targeted impact

a third saturn ib test  launched from pad 37 went into orbit to support design of the s ivb upper stage restart capability needed for the saturn v it carried a nosecone instead of the apollo spacecraft and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors and a tv camera this flight occurred on july 5 before as 202 which was delayed because of problems getting the apollo spacecraft ready for flight name nasareport 
two manned orbital block i csm missions were planned as 204 and as 205 the block i crew positions were titled command pilot senior pilot and pilot the senior pilot would assume navigation duties while the pilot would function as a systems engineer the astronauts would wear 
after an unmanned lm test flight as 206 a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as 207 208 or as 278 each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib the block ii crew positions were titled commander cdr command module pilot cmp and lunar module pilot lmp the astronauts would begin wearing a new  designed to accommodate lunar  eva the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear fishbowl type for greater visibility and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water cooled undergarment
 the grounded  who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs selected the first apollo crew in january 1966 with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie  as pilot but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the  and had to undergo surgery on january 27 slayton replaced him with chaffee  nasa announced the final crew selection for as 204 on march 21 1966 with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans  and  with rookie  mercury gemini veteran  eisele and rookie  were announced on september 29 as the prime crew for as 205
in december 1966 the as 205 mission was canceled since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the 14 day first flight and as 205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission now redesignated as 205 208 or as 258 planned for august 1967 mcdivitt scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as 258 crew and schirra eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo 1 backup crew chapter 87 http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history sp 4205 ch8 7html preparations for the first manned apollo mission 
 
the spacecraft for the as 202 and as 204 missions were delivered by north american aviation to the kennedy space center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight these delays caused the launch of as 202 to slip behind as 203 and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as november 1966 concurrently with the last gemini mission eventually the planned as 204 flight date was pushed to february 21 1967 name sp4029 http  historynasagov sp 4029 apollo_01a_summaryhtm apollo 1 the fire 27ampnbspjanuary 1967 
north american aviation was prime contractor not only for the apollo csm but for the saturn v  second stage as well and delays in this stage pushed the first unmanned saturn v flight as 501 from late 1966 to november 1967 the initial assembly of as 501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage 
the problems with north american were severe enough in late 1965 to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a  to investigate north americans problems and identify corrections phillips documented his findings in a december 19 letter to naa president  with a strongly worded letter by mueller and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamansnasa never volunteered the tiger team findings to the us congress in the course of its regular oversight but its existence was publicly disclosed as the phillips report in the course of the senate investigation into the apollo 204 fire  
meanwhile  was also encountering problems with the lunar module eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 not long after the first manned csm flights chapter 74 http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history sp 4205 ch7 4html the lem test program a pacing item 
 
grissom white and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center a plugs out test was planned for january which would simulate a launch countdown on lc 34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad supplied to internal power if successful this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february 21 launch with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled name sea4 
the plugs out test began on the morning of january 27 1967 and immediately was plagued with problems first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch then communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown during this hold an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure 100% oxygen atmosphere pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area frustrating attempts to rescue the crew the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened name sea5 
nasa immediately convened an accident review board overseen by both houses of congress while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex the review board concluded that deficiencies existed in command module design workmanship and quality control name sea5   at the insistence of nasa administrator webb north american removed  as command module program manager  webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office aspo manager  replacing him with  name keypersonnelchange p 119 
to remedy the causes of the fire changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures the most important of which were use of a nitrogen oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i  hatch cover with a quick release outward opening door nasa discontinued the manned block i program using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights crew members would also exclusively wear modified fire resistant block ii space suits and would be designated by the block ii titles regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not
 
on april 24 1967 mueller published an official apollo mission numbering scheme using sequential numbers for all flights manned or unmanned the sequence would start with  to cover the first three unmanned flights while retiring the apollo 1 designation to honor the crew per their widows wishes name missionnumbers  part 1h 
in september 1967 mueller approved a  which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary theore letters were used instead of numbers the a missions were unmanned saturn v validation b was unmanned lm validation using the saturn ib c was manned csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib d was the first manned csm lm flight this replaced as 258 using a single saturn v launch e would be a higher earth orbit csm lm flight f would be the first lunar mission testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing a dress rehearsal and g would be the first manned landing the list of types covered follow on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings i for lunar orbital survey missions and j for extended stay lunar landings name 3q1967 p 157 
the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man rating the lm and saturn v apollo 4 as 501 was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v carrying a block i csm on november 9 1967 the capability of the command modules heat shield to survive a trans lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth orbital reentry speed this was followed on april 4 1968 by  as 502 which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast the intent of this mission was to achieve trans lunar injection followed closely by a simulated direct return abort using the service module engine to achieve another high speed reentry the saturn v experienced  a problem caused by non steady engine combustion which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages two s ii engines shut down prematurely but the remaining engines were able to compensate the damage to the third stage engine was more severe preventing it from restarting for trans lunar injection mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo 4 based on the good performance of apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo 6 problems nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men cancelling a third unmanned test chapter 105 http  wwwhqnasagov office pao history sp 4205 ch10 5html apollo 6 saturn vs shaky dress rehearsal

in november 1969 gemini veteran  and rookie  made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the  unmanned lunar probe which had landed in april 1967 on the  the command module pilot was gemini veteran  conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun they made two evas totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes on one they walked to the surveyor photographed it and removed some parts which they returned to earth 
the contracted batch of 15 saturn vs were enough for lunar landing missions through apollo 20 nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions along with the payload capacity of the saturn v these final missions would combine the i and j types in the 1967 list allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days these missions would also carry the  lrv increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm also the block ii spacesuit was  to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander with two rookies apollo 13 launched lovell  and  in april 1970 headed for the  but two days out a liquid oxygen tank exploded disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a life boat to return to earth another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications name ksc apollo_13   apollo was grounded again for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added
 
about the time of the first landing in 1969 it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre built on the ground replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches this eliminated apollo 20 nasas yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming  by 1971 the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19 the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the  on merritt island florida  in  alabama  in  louisiana and  in houston texas
the cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions  had been planned to be the last of the h series missions but since there would be only two subsequent missions left it was changed to the first of three j missions

the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth as measured by  techniques they range in age from about 32 billion years for the ic samples derived from the  to about 46 billion years for samples derived from the  crust pp 5 001 – 5 234  as such they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the  that are largely absent on earth one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the  retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo 15 mission this  rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium rich feldspar mineral  and is believed to be representative of the highland crust a geochemical component called  was discovered which has no known terrestrial counterpart kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten see 
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects many samples appear to be pitted with  impact craters which is never seen on earth rocks due to the thick atmosphere many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events some of the returned samples are of impact melt materials melted near an impact crater all samples returned from the moon are highly ted as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events
analysis of composition of the lunar samples supports the  that the moon was created through impact of a large astronomical body with the earth p 431 
when president kennedy first chartered the moon landing program a preliminary cost estimate of 7 billion was generated but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely and james webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to 20 billion before giving it to vice president johnson name butts 
when kennedy made his 1962 speech at rice university the annual space budget was 54 billion and he described this cost as 40 cents per person per week somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year but that the moon program would soon raise this to more than 50 cents a week for every man woman and child in the united states name rice speech 
webbs estimate shocked many at the time including the president but ultimately proved to be reasonably accurate in january 1969 nasa prepared an itemized estimate of the run out cost of the apollo program the total came to 239 billion itemized as follows p 67 
apollo spacecraft 79450 million
saturn i launch vehicles 7671 million
saturn ib launch vehicles 11312 million
saturn v launch vehicles 68711 million
launch vehicle engine development 8542 million
mission support 14323 million
tracking and data acquisition 6641 million
ground facilities 18303 million
operation of installations 24206 million
the final cost of apollo was reported to congress as 254 billion in 1973 p 1271   it took up the majority of nasas budget while it was being developed for example in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of nasas total 52 billion budget  a single saturn v launch in 1969 cost up to 375 million compared to the s fiscal year 1970 budget of 440 million chapter 2 http  historynasagov sp 4221 ch2htm nasas uncertain future p 73 
in 2009 nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly 170 billion this included all  costs the procurement of 15 saturn v rockets 16 command service modules 12 lunar modules plus program support and management costs construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading and costs for flight operations this was based on a  report a budgetary analysis of nasas new vision for space september 2004 name butts  the space review estimated in 2010 the cost of apollo from 1959 to 1973 as 204 billion or 109 billion in 2010 dollars name lafleur20100308 
looking beyond the manned lunar landings nasa investigated several post lunar applications for apollo hardware the apollo extension series apollo x proposed up to 30 flights to earth orbit using the space in the  sla to house a small orbital laboratory workshop astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s ivb saturn upper stage and grew into the apollo applications program aap the workshop was to be supplemented by apollo telescope missions which would replace the lms descent stage equipment and engine with a solar telescope observatory the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a 
the s ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board dubbed  it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a saturn v it was equipped with an  the solar telescope that would have been used on the apollo telescope missions skylabs last crew departed the station on february 8 1974 and the station itself re entered the atmosphere in 1979 by which time it had become the oldest operational apollo saturn component
in september 2007 the  and  announced the  to be awarded for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close up images of the apollo lunar modules and  
in 2008 s  probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo 15 lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface  in 2009 nasas   while orbiting  above the moon photographed the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed   all of the u s flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing with the exception of the one left during the apollo 11 mission which was blown over during that missions lift off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown 
in a november 16 2009 editorial  opined
the apollo program has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history   apollo stimulated many areas of technology the  design used in both the lunar and command modules was along with the  the driving force behind early research into s  was first used in the fabrication of apollo structural components
the crew of apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth and read from the creation story in the  on christmas eve 1968 this was believed to be the most widely watched television broadcast until that time the mission and christmas provided an inspiring end to 1968 which had been a troubled year for the us marked by  protests race riots and the assassinations of civil rights leader  and senator 
an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the apollo 11 moonwalk p 429 
an effect of the apollo program is the view of earth as a fragile small planet captured in photographs taken by the astronauts during the lunar missions the most famous taken by the apollo 17 astronauts is 
many astronauts and cosmonauts have commented on the profound effects that seeing earth from space has had on them  the  are the only humans to have observed earth from beyond low earth orbit and have traveled farther from earth than anyone else to date
according to  apollo succeeded in accomplishing president kennedys goal of taking on the soviet union in the  and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement and thereby showcased the superiority of the capitalistic free market system as represented by the us the publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast centralized government bureaucracy 
as part of apollo 11s 40th anniversary in 2009 nasa spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the missions live televised moonwalk  after an exhaustive three year search for missing tapes of the original video of the apollo 11 moonwalk nasa concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased name npr_tapes 
the moon landing data was recorded by a special  which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast tv this resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes during the following years a magnetic tape shortage prompted nasa to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the  to be recorded over with newer satellite data stan lebar who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at  also worked with nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes name npr_tapes 
with a budget of 230000 the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo 11 was compiled by nafzger and assigned to  for restoration the video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy name moon footage restore  the images were from tapes in  the  archive and  recordings made at johnson space center the restored video remaining in black and white contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements name moon footage restore

in  assault is harmful or offensive contact with a person 
an assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent present ability to cause the harm it is both a crime and a tort and theore may result in either criminal and or civil liability generally the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law there is however an additional criminal law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful battery the term is often confused with  which involves physical contact the specific meaning of assault varies between countries but can er to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of forcearkansas code title 5 chapter 13 subchapter 2 § 205–207 california penal code part 1 chapter 9 § 240  assault in many us jurisdictions and  is defined more broadly still as any intentional physical contact with another person without their consent but in  and in most  other  jurisdictions in the world this is defined instead as  some jurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the definition of the crime making it a criminal assault intentionally to cause another person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact
in common law criminal assault often accompanies  see  the elements of battery are 1 a volitional actan act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to lexive or involuntary see dennis j baker glanville williams textbook of criminal law london sweet amp maxwell 2012 at p 901 for example a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep the contact although harmful would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful  2 done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and 3 which causes such contacta criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant  thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person and is an assault if the rock misses
 assault is in some jurisdictions a stronger form of assault usually using a   a person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to
 cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon name baker 
 cause  to another person such as rape or kidnapping
 have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent
 cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a  often erred to as either vehicular assault or aggravated assault with a motor vehicle
aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants
although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault
exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as  harm assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others
 may be a complete or partial defense to assault in some jurisdictions most notably england it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assaultrvg  6 1980 see   this can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual  the most notable case being the  case legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery activities within the rules of a game    or  bodily adornment r v wilson or horseplay jones and others however any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent in scottish law consent is not a defense for assaulthttp  wwwbailiiorg scot cases scothc 1975 1975_jc_30html smart v h m advocate 1975nowiki nowiki scothc hcj_1 1975 slt 65 1975 jc 30 
 and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an  or generally carrying out their official duties thus a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary
in some jurisdictions such as   is part of the  the officers who administer the punishment have  from prosecution for assault
in the united states the united kingdom australia and canada  is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable what constitutes reasonable varies in both statutory law and  unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for 
many countries including some us states also permit the use of less severe corporal punishment for  in  s58  limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 
this may or may not involve self defense in that using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence
some jurisdictions allow force to be used in  to prevent damage either in its own right or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime in english law under s5  it may be argued that the defendant has a lawful excuse to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3  subject to the need to deter s and excessive self help furthermore some jurisdictions such as ohio allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder the resident merely needs to assert to the court that he felt threatened by the intruders presence
this defense is not universal in new zealand for example homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars
assault is an offence under s 265 of the  canadian  name 1985 46  there is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur generally an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent it can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force or threatens to do so without the consent of the other person an injury need not occur for an assault to be committed but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force it can be an assault to tap pinch push or direct another such minor action toward another but an accidental application of force is not an assault
the potential punishment for an assault in canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed the criminal code defines assault as a dual offence indictable or summary offence police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the publics interest to do so notwithstanding s4952d of the code name 1985 46  this public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim
some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include
 assault the offence is defined by section 265 of the code name 1985 46 
 assault with a weapon section 267a of the code name 1985 46 
 assault causing bodily harm see  section 267b of the code name 1985 46 
 aggravated assault section 268 of the code name 1985 46 
 assaulting a peace officer etc section 270 of the code name 1985 46 
 sexual assault section 271 of the code name 1985 46 
 sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm section 272 of the code name 1985 46 
 aggravated sexual assault see 
an individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm aggravated assault or any sexual assault consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused r v paice r v jobidon a person cannot consent to serious bodily harm
the indian penal code covers the punishments and types of assault in chapter 16  sections 351 through 358
the code further explains that mere words do not amount to an assault but the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault assault is in indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force with criminal force being described in s350 the attempt itself has been made an offence in india as in other states
the criminal code act chapter 29 of part v sections 351 to 365 creates a number of offences of assault  assault is defined by section 252 of that act assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her or who indecently assaults another or who commits other more serious variants of assault as defined in the act are guilty of a felony and longer prison terms are provided for

alfheim  land of the fairies also called ljosalfheim ljósálfaheimr  home is one of the  and home of the  in 
Álfheim as an abode of the fairies is mentioned only twice in  texts
the   describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanzaampnbsp5 with
blockquote call they ampnbsp ampnbsp the place where br 
a hall for himself hath setbr 
and Álfheim the gods ampnbsp ampnbsp to  once gavebr 
as a tooth gift in ancient times blockquote
a tooth gift was a gift given to an  on the cutting of the first tooth
in the 12th century eddic prose   relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven
blockquotethat which is called Álfheim is one where dwell the peoples called  light elves but the  dark elves dwell down in the earth and they are unlike in appearance but by far more unlike in nature the light elves are fairer to look upon than the sun but the dark elves are blacker than pitch
 blockquote
the account later in speaking of a hall in the highest heaven called  that shall survive when heaven and earth have died explains
blockquoteit is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one and it is called  andlangr endlong but the third heaven is yet above that and it is called  vídbláinn wide blue and in that heaven we think this abode is but we believe that none but light elves inhabit these mansions now blockquote
it is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct some texts read vindbláin vindbláinn wind blue instead of vídbláin
modern commentators speculate or sometimes state as fact that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds heima mentioned in stanzaampnbsp2 of the eddic poem

in  ask and embla from  askr ok embla—male and female respectively—were the first two humans created by the gods the pair are attested in both the  compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources and the  written in the 13th century by  in both sources  gods one of whom is  find ask and embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts a number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures and there are occasional erences to them in popular culture
 askr literally means  but the  of embla is uncertain and two possibilities of  the meaning of embla are generally proposed the first meaning  is problematic and is reached by deriving elm la from almilōn and subsequently to almr elm name simek74simek 200774  the second suggestion is  which is reached through ambilō which may be related to the  term ámpelos itself meaning vine  name simek74simek 200774  the latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories
according to   says the word embla emla signifies a busy woman from amr ambr aml ambl assiduous labour the same relation as  the  names of the first man and woman who were also formed from trees name thorpe337thorpe 1907337 
in stanza 17 of the poetic edda poem  the  reciting the poem states that   and  once found ask and embla on land the völva says that the two were capable of very little lacking in  and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods

the meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations theore vary name schach93schach 198593 
according to chapter 9 of the prose edda book  the three brothers  and odin are the creators of the first man and woman the brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there they took the wood and from it created the first human beings ask and embla one of the three gave them the breath of life the second gave them movement and intelligence and the third gave them shape speech hearing and sight further the three gods gave them clothing and names ask and embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of  name byock18byock 200618 
a  basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of embla meaning vine in indo european societies an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and  vines were used as a flammable wood where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood resulting in fire further evidence of ritual making of fire in  has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a    name simek74 
 comments that ancient myths teem with trite first couples of the type of  in indo european tradition these range from the vedic yama and yamī and the iranian mašya and mašyānag to the icelandic askr and embla with trees or rocks as perred raw material and s teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure name puhvel 284puhvel 1989 1987284 
in his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in indo european society anders hultgård observes that myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient europe and indo europe and indo european speaking peoples of asia minor and iran by contrast the cultures of the near east show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive mans origin from clay earth or blood by means of a divine creation act name hultgaard 62hultgård 200662 
two wooden figures—the —of more than human height were unearthed from a  at  in   the figures depict a nude male and a nude female  comments that these figures may represent a lord and lady of the  a group of norse gods and that another memory of these wooden deities may survive in the tradition of the creation of ask and embla the man and woman who founded the human race created by the gods from trees on the seashore name davidson 88 89davidson 197588—89 
a figure named   ash tree appears as the son of  in the  genealogy for the kings of  this has resulted in an amount of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre norse  name orchard8orchard 19978 
connections have been proposed between ask and embla and the  kings assi and ambri attested in s 7th century ad work  there the two ask the god  odin for victory the name ambri like embla likely derives from ambilō name simek74 
a preceding stanza to the account of the creation of ask and embla in völuspá provides a catalog of  and stanza 10 has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth this may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans and that the three gods gave them life name lindow62 63lindow 200162—63  carolyne larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in old norse works examples include trees of jewellery for women and trees of battle for men due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees ask and embla name larrington279larrington 1999279 
ask and embla have been the subject of a number of erences and artistic depictions a sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern swedish city of  created in 1948 by stig blomberg ask and embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the  in   by  name oslokommune  in 2003  artist  included a depiction of the couple in his series of faroe islands stamps

alain de lille or alanus ab insulis  1128 – 1202 1203 was a french  and  he was born in  some time before 1128 his exact date of death remains unclear as well with most research pointing toward it being between april 14 1202 and april 5 1203 
little is known of his life however it is clear that alan entered the schools no earlier than the late 1140s first attending the school at  and then at  he probably studied under masters such as   and  this is known through the writings of  who is thought to have been a near exact contemporary student of alan of lille name auto1   his earliest writings were probably written in the 1150s and probably in paris name auto2   alan spent many years teaching at the school in paris and he attended the  in 1179 though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in paris and taught there as well as some time in southern france into his old age he afterwards inhabited  he is sometimes called alanus de montepessulano lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister and finally retired to  where he died in 1202
he had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge more varied than profound caused him to be called doctor universalis many of alan’s writings are unable to be exactly dated and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well however it does seem clear that his first notable work  was completed somewhere between 1155 and 1165 with the most conclusive date being 1160 and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in paris name auto1   among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the  of the  one of these the de planctu naturae is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity  he created the allegory of grammatical conjugation which was to have its successors throughout the middle ages  the anticlaudianus a treatise on morals as  the form of which recalls the pamphlet of claudian against rufinus is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity
as a theologian alain de lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against the   his  however is far from being as absolute as that of the   in the anticlaudianus he sums up as follows reason guided by prudence can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith  this rule is completed in his treatise ars catholicae fidei as follows theology itself may be demonstrated by reason  alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the   this bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection    etc that gives his treatise its apparent originality
alan’s philosophy was a sort of mixture of  and  philosophy the platonist seemed to outweigh the aristotelian in alan but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much aristotelian logic combined with  mathematics name auto1  
one of alans most notable works was one he modeled after ’  to which he gave the title  or the plaint of nature and which was most likely written in the late 1160s name auto2   in this work alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of god name auto2   he also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality has defiled itself from nature and god in  another of his notable works alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man she has only the ability to create a soulless body and thus she is “persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul” and “the seven liberal arts produce a chariot for her the five senses are the horses”  the anticlaudianus was translated into french and german in the following century and toward 1280 was re worked into a musical anthology by a j creighton anticlaudien a thirteenth century french adaptation washington 1944 andrew hughes the ludus super anticlaudianum of adam de la bassée journal of the american musicological society 231 1970 1–25  one of alan’s most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching  or the art of preaching this work shows how alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be “used as a practical manual” when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching 
alan wrote three very large theological textbooks one being his first work  another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus is his  dated somewhere between 1185 to 1200 alan sets out to ute heretical views specifically that of the  and  name auto2   in his third theological textbook  he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules this was typical of the followers of  of which alan could be associated name auto2   other than these theological textbooks and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry alan of lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects primarily including    and various collections of poems
alain de lille has often been confounded with other persons named alain in particular with another alanus  alan abbot of tewkesbury alain de podio etc  certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him as well as some of their works thus the life of st bernard should be ascribed to alain of auxerre and the commentary upon merlin to   alan of lille was not the author of a memoriale rerum difficilium published under his name nor of  nor of the satirical  once attributed to him and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the dicta alani de lapide philosophico really issued from his pen  on the other hand it now seems practically demonstrated that alain de lille was the author of the ars catholicae fidei and the treatise contra haereticos
in his sermons on capital sins alain argued that  and homicide are the most serious sins since they call forth the wrath of god which led to the destruction of  his chief work on penance the liber poenitenitalis dedicated to  exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the  alains identification of the sins against nature included   oral and anal intercourse   and  in addition to his battle against moral decay alan wrote a work against   and christian heretics dedicated to william viii of

in 496 the alemanni were  by  leader  and incorporated into his   mentioned as still  allies of the  franks the alemanni were gradually christianized during the 7th century the  is a record of their customary law during this period until the 8th century frankish suzerainty over alemannia was mostly nominal but after an uprising by    executed the alamannic nobility and installed frankish dukes 
during the later and weaker years of the  the alemannic counts became almost independent and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the  the chief family in alamannia was that of the counts of  who were sometimes called margraves and one of whom    established the  which was recognized by  in 919 and became a  of the 
the area settled by the alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where  dialects remain spoken including german  and  french   and austrian 
according to  quoted in the mid 6th century by byzantine historian  their name means all men it indicates that they were a conglomeration drawn from various germanic tribes this was the derivation of alemanni used by  in his decline and fall of the roman empire  and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of  published in 1753 who noted that it was the name used by outsiders for those who called themselves the histoire de lacadémie royale des inscriptions et belles lettres avec les mémoires de littérature tirés des registres de cette académie depuis lannée mdccxliv jusques et compris lannée mdccxlvi vol xviii paris 1753 pp49–71  excerpts are on line at http  wwweliohsunifiit testi 700 freret vueshtml#notaed eliohs   this etymology has remained the standard derivation of the termit is cited in most etymological dictionaries such as the  large edition under the root http  wwwbartlebycom 61 roots ie295html man  
 a monk of the  writing in the 9th century remarked in discussing the people of switzerland and the surrounding regions that only foreigners called them the alemanni but that they gave themselves the name of suebi
the name of germany and the german language in several languages is derived from the name of this early germanic tribal alliance for details see 
the alemanni were first mentioned by  describing the campaign of  in 213 at that time they apparently dwelt in the basin of the  to the south of the 
 78134 portrays the alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor  they had asked for his help says dio but instead he colonized their country changed their place names and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid when he became ill the alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him 78152 caracalla it was claimed tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits
in retribution caracalla then led the  against the alemanni who lost and were pacified for a time the legion was as a result honored with the name germanica the 4th century fictional  life of antoninus caracalla relates 105 that caracalla then assumed the name alemannicus at which helvius pertinax jested that he should really be called geticus maximus because in the year before he had murdered his brother   not on good terms with caracalla geta had been invited to a family reconciliation at which time he was ambushed by centurions in caracallas army and slain in his mother julias arms true or not caracalla pursued by devils of his own left rome never to return
caracalla left for the frontier where for the rest of his short reign he was known for his unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations if he had any reasons of state for such actions they remained unknown to his contemporaries whether or not the alemanni had been previously neutral they were certainly further influenced by caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of rome
this mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the roman writers persisted in calling the alemanni barbari savages the archaeology however shows that they were largely romanized lived in roman style houses and used roman artifacts the alemannic women having adopted the roman fashion of the  even earlier than the men
most of the alemanni were probably at the time in fact resident in or close to the borders of  although dio is the earliest writer to mention them  used the name to er to germans on the  in the time of s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed c 98 99 at that time the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time trees from the earliest fortifications found in  are dated by  to 99 100 ad  shortly afterwards trajan was chosen by  to be his successor adopted with public fanfare in absentia by the old man shortly before his death by 100 ad trajan was back in rome as emperor instead of merely being a consul
ammianus relates http  wwwgmuedu departments fld classics ammianus17html xvii111 that much later the emperor  undertook a  against the alemanni who by then were in alsace and crossed the main latin menus entering the forest where the trails were blocked by felled trees as winter was upon them they reoccupied a
fortification which was founded on the soil of the alemanni that trajan wished to be called with his own namemunimentum quod in alamannorum solo conditum traianus suo nomine voluit appellari 
in this context the use of alemanni is possibly an anachronism but it reveals that ammianus believed they were the same people which is consistent with the location of the alemanni of caracallas campaigns
the early detailed source the  of  has sometimes been interpreted in such a way as to provide yet other historical problems in http  wwwsacred textscom cla tac g01040htm chapter 42 we read of the  a tribe certainly located in the region that later became  tacitus stated that they traded with  which in ptolemy is located across the danube from  a logical conclusion to draw is that the hermunduri extended over later  and theore the alemanni originally derived from the hermunduri
however no hermunduri appear in ptolemy though after the time of ptolemy the hermunduri joined with the  in the wars of 166–180 against the empire a caul reading of tacitus provides one solution he says that the source of the  is among the hermunduri somewhat to the east of the upper  he places them also between the  varisti whose location at the very edge of the ancient  is well known and the  and  moreover the hermunduri were broken in the  and made a separate peace with rome the alemanni thus were probably not primarily the hermunduri although some elements of them may have been present in the mix of peoples at that time that became alemannian
before the mention of alemanni in the time of caracalla you would search in vain for alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern germany in claudius  written in greek in the mid 2nd century it is likely that at that time the people who later used that name were known by other designationsptolemys description has some limitations upper germany and lower germany are mentioned by name but only as specific districts of gallia belgica 28 the border between them was an unidentified river the obruncus the region is repeated again under germany but this time he does not list roman boundaries germania superior the agri decumates and the limes are not to be found there even though they certainly existed at the time germania magna is found within the rhine danube vistula and shores of the oceanus germanicus most of the tribes are missing or listed without name the main is not there nor lake constance the danube runs from the alps the rhine does not bend to the south next to swabia ptolemys germania is like a surreal image of itself accurate only if you follow certain known lines but the overall shape is greatly distorted 
nevertheless some conclusions can be drawn from ptolemy germania superior is easily identified following up the rhine one comes to a town mattiacum which must be at the border of the roman germany vicinity of  upstream from it and between the rhine and  in the  are the     and  some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before on the other side of the northern black forest were the  about where  is today on the lower main
historic swabia was eventually replaced by todays  but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval  comprising all germania superior and territory east to  it did not include the upper main but that is where caracalla campaigned moreover the territory of germania superior was not originally included among the alemannis possessions
however if we look for the peoples in the region from the upper main in the north south to the danube and east to the  where the  and  were located ptolemy does not give any tribes there are the  just south of the  and at the other end of what was then the black forest the  whose location is known one possible reason for this distribution is that the population perred not to live in the forest except in troubled times the region between the forest and the  on the other hand included about a dozen settlements or cantons
ptolemys view of germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the black forest region and was replaced by a canton structure the tribes stayed in the roman province perhaps because the romans offered stability also caracalla perhaps felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe such as the chatti or  against whom rome had suffered grievous losses by caracallas time the name alemanni was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army the war bands
the term suebi has a double meaning in the sources on the one hand tacitus germania tells us http  wwwsacred textscom cla tac g01030htm chapters 38 39 that they occupy more than half of germany use a distinctive hair style and are spiritually centered on the  on the other hand the suebi of the upper danube are described as though they were a tribe
the solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the agri decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of germans there are probably to be found in the german attack on the gallic fortified town of  in 58 bc the upper rhine and danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at vesontio

the gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the romans in 53 bc the  broke their alliance and attempted to break free of rome caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the germans he crossed the rhine to forestall that event a successful strategy remembering their expensive defeat at the battle of vesontio the germans withdrew to the black forest concentrating there a mixed population dominated by suebi as they had left their tribal homes behind they probably took over all the former celtic cantons along the danube
   this material will be going back in as soon as i set up for it the alemanni emerged from the  other groups included the     and perhaps the  close allies of the alemanni were the east germanic   or suabi hence  the hermunduri had apparently belonged to the suebi but it is likely enough that reinforcements from new suebic tribes had now moved westward in later times the names alemanni and suebi seem to become synonymous although some of the suebi later migrated to  and established an independent kingdom there that endured well into the 6th century   
the alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the  in the 3rd and 4th centuries they launched a major invasion of  and northern  in 268 when the romans were forced to denude much of their german frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the  from the east their raids throughout the three parts of gaul were traumatic  died ca 594 mentions their destructive force at the time of  and  253–260 when the alemanni assembled under their king whom he calls  who by the advice it is said of his wicked mother and overran the whole of the gauls and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times and coming to  he set on fire overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call vasso galatae in the gallic tongue martyring many christians http  wwwfordhamedu halsall basis gregory histhtml#book3 historia francorum book i32–34 thus 6th century gallo romans of gregorys class surrounded by the ruins of s and public buildings attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the alemanni

their most famous battle against rome took place in   in 357 where they were defeated by  later emperor of rome and their king  was taken prisoner to rome
on january 2 366 the alemanni yet again crossed the frozen  in large numbers to invade the gallic provinces this time being defeated by valentinian see  in the great mixed invasion of 406 the alemanni appear to have crossed the  a final time conquering and then settling what is today  and a large part of the  the crossing is described in s historical novel eagle in the snow s chronicle gives the account at alba augusta  the devastation was so complete that the christian bishop retired to  but in gregorys account at mende in  also deep in the heart of gaul bishop privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated  it is thought this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence

the kingdom  of alamannia between strasbourg and augsburg lasted until 496 when the alemanni were conquered by  at the  the war of clovis with the alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of clovis briefly treated by  http  wwwfordhamedu halsall source gregory clovisconvhtml#n30 book ii31 subsequently the alemanni formed part of the  dominions and were governed by a frankish duke
in 746  ended an uprising by summarily executing all alemannic nobility at the  and for the following century alemannia was ruled by frankish dukes following the  of 843 alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of  the precursor of the  the duchy persisted until 1268
the german spoken today over the range of the former alemanni is termed  and is recognised among the subgroups of the  alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the  are among the earliest testimonies of 
the  is thought to have originated around the 5th century either in alemannia or among the  before that the dialect spoken by alemannic tribes was little different from that of other west germanic peoples
alemannia lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when  absorbed it into the frankish empire early in the 8th century today alemannic is a linguistic term erring to  encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of  german state in western  german state in  austrian state  in switzerland and the  of the  france
the alemanni established a series of territorially defined pagi cantons on the east bank of the rhine the exact number and extent of these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time
pagi usually pairs of pagi combined formed kingdoms regna which it is generally believed were permanent and hereditary ammianus describes alemanni rulers with various terms reges excelsiores ante alios paramount kings reges proximi neighbouring kings reguli petty kings and regales princes this may be a formal hierarchy or they may be vague overlapping terms or a combination of bothdrinkwater 2007 118 120  in 357 there appear to have been two paramount kings chnodomar and westralp who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings reges their territories were small and mostly strung along the rhine although a few were in the hinterlanddrinkwater 2007 223 map  it is possible that the reguli were the rulers of the two pagi in each kingdom underneath the royal class were the nobles called optimates by the romans and warriors called armati by the romans the warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free menspeidel 2004  each nobleman could raise an average of c 50 warriorsdrinkwater 2007 120 
the  of the alemanni took place during  times 6th to 8th centuries we know that in the 6th century the alemanni were predominantly pagan and in the 8th century they were predominantly christian the intervening 7th century was a period of genuine  during which christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence
some scholars have speculated that members of the alemannic elite such as king  due to  influence may have been converted to  even in the later 5th centuryschubert hans 1909 das älteste germanische christentum oder der sogenannte arianismus der germanen tübingen jcb mohr pg32 cf also bossert g alemanni in jackson sm ed new schaff herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge vol 1 pg 114 the alamannic prince gibuld was an arian probably converted by goths 
in the mid 6th century the byzantine historian  records in the context of the wars of the goths and franks against byzantium that the alemanni fighting among the troops of frankish king  were like the franks in all respects except religion since
he also spoke of the particular ruthlessness of the alemanni in destroying christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries agathias expresses his hope that the alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the franks which is by all appearances in a manner of speaking what eventually happenedr keydell agathiae myrinaei historiarum libri quinque corpus fontium historiae byzantinae series berolinensis 2 berlin de gruyter 1967 p 18f
 
apostles of the alemanni were  and his disciple   records that columbanus was active in  where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to  despite these activities for some time the alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities with only superficial or  christian elements in particular there is no change in burial practice and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout merovingian times syncretism of traditional germanic animal style with christian symbolism is also present in artwork but christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century unlike the later christianization of the saxons and of the slavs the alemanni seem to have adopted christianity gradually and voluntarily spread in emulation of the merovingian elite
from c the 520s to the 620s there was a surge of  about 70 specimens have survived roughly half of them on  others on belt buckles see   and other jewelry and weapon parts use of runes subsides with the advance of christianity
the  early 7th century clearly records pagan theonyms logaþorewodanwigiþonar  read as  wodan and donar are magicians sorcerers but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities or a christian protective charm against them name düwel 
a runic inscription on a fibula found at  lects christian pious sentiment and is also explicitly marked with a christian cross reading god fura dih deofile ᛭ god for before you theophilus or alternatively god before you devil dated to between ad 660 and 690 it marks the end of the native alemannic tradition of runic literacy bad ems is in  on the northwestern boundary of alemannic settlement where frankish influence would have been strongestwolfgang jungandreas god fura dih deofile † in zeitschrift für deutsches altertum und deutsche literatur 101 1972 pp 84–85 
the establishment of the bishopric of  cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by columbanus himself before 612 in any case it existed by 635 when  appointed  bishop constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands and did not look back on late roman church history unlike the raetian bishopric of  established 451 and  which was an episcopal seat from 740 and which continued the line of bishops of  see  the establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history in the early 7th century  hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church while s  of 720 has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone

labors constitution states the australian labor party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features in these fields name d3n8a8pro7vhmxcloudfrontnethttp  d3n8a8pro7vhmxcloudfrontnet australianlaborparty pages 121 attachments original 1365135867 labor_national_platformpdf1365135867 australian labor party national platform retrieved 11 december 2014  this socialist objective was introduced in 1921 but has since been qualified by two further objectives maintenance of and support for a competitive non monopolistic private sector and the right to own private property labor governments have not attempted the democratic socialisation of any industry since the 1940s when the chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks and in fact have  several industries such as aviation and banking labors current national platform describes the party as a modern social democratic party the party of opportunity and security for working people and a party of active government name d3n8a8pro7vhmxcloudfrontnet 
the alp was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the  in 1901 nevertheless it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various australian colonies by the emerging  formally beginning in 1892 labor is thus the countrys oldest political party colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891 and federal seats following  at the  labor was the first party in australia to win a majority in either house of the australian parliament at the  the alp pre dates both the  and the  in party formation government and policy implementation  internationally the alp is a member of the  network of social democratic parties  having previously been a member of the

the present australian labor party has its origins in the labour parties founded in the 1890s in the australian colonies prior to federation labor tradition ascribes the founding of queensland labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree the  in  in 1891 the  branch of the party claims to be the oldest in australia labour as a parliamentary party dates from 1891 in new south wales and south australia 1893 in queensland and later in the other colonies
the first election contested by labour candidates was the  when labour candidates then called the labor electoral league of new south wales won 35 of 141 seats the major parties were the  and  parties and labour held the  it offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions  the  was founded in 1891 and three candidates were that year elected to the  name pha  the first successful  candidate was  at the   however was elected as an independent labor candidate at the  while he was the first labor member of the house of assembly he was not a member of the newly formed ulp
at the  the ulp was immediately elevated to  status with 10 of 54 lower house seats the liberal government of  was formed with the support of the ulp ousting the conservative government of  so successful less than a decade later at the   would form the worlds first stable labor government  led labor to form the states first of many s at the 
in 1899  formed a minority labour   do not change spelling it is correct in historical context    government in  the first in the world which lasted one week while the  regrouped after a split
the colonial labour   do not change spelling it is correct in historical context    parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the  some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution claiming  that the senate as proposed was too powerful similar to the anti ormist colonial upper houses and the  they feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces the first labour   do not change spelling it is correct in historical context    leader and prime minister  however was a supporter of federation
 was contested by each state labour party in total they won 14 of the 75 seats in the house of representatives and the labour members now met as the federal parliamentary labour   do not change spelling it is correct in historical context    party informally known as the  on 8 may 1901 at  the meeting place of the first federal parliament the caucus decided to support the protectionist government against the opposition free trade party it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level labour    do not change spelling is correct in historical context   under  more than doubled its vote to 23 at the  and continued to hold the balance of power in april 1904 however watson and deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the  and  bill to cover state public servants the fallout causing deakin to resign free trade leader  declined to take office which saw watson become the first labour   do not change spelling is correct in historical context     and the worlds first labour head of government at a national level  had led a short lived labour government in queensland in december 1899 though his was a  that lasted only four months he was aged only 37 and is still the youngest prime minister in australias history name adbwatson 
 then formed another minority government 1908–09 at the  fisher led labor to victory forming australias first elected federal  australias first elected  majority the worlds first  majority government at a national level and after the 1904  minority government the worlds second labour party government at a national level it was the first time a labour party had controlled any house of a legislature and the first time the party controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature name adbfisher  the state branches were also successful except in  where the strength of  liberalism inhibited the partys growth the state branches formed their first majority governments in  and south australia in 1910 in western australia in 1911 in  in 1915 and in  in 1925 such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years
analysis of the early nsw labor caucus reveals a band of unhappy amateurs made up of blue collar workers a squatter a doctor and even a mine owner indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed labor is untrue in addition many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies – in the first grouping of state mps 17 of the 35 were free traders
in the aftermath of  and the  support for socialism grew in trade union ranks and at the 1921 all australian trades union congress a resolution was passed calling for the socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange the 1922  adopted a similarly worded socialist objective which remained official policy for many years the resolution was immediately qualified however by the  amendment which said that socialisation was desirable only when was necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features in practice the socialist objective was a dead letter only once has a federal labor government attempted to nationalise any industry s bank nationalisation of 1947 and that was held by the  to be unconstitutional the commitment to nationalisation was dropped by  and s government carried out many free market orms including the floating of the dollar and  of state enterprises such as  airways and the 
the labor party is commonly described as a  party and its constitution stipulates that it is a  party  the party was created by and has always been influenced by the trade unions and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement thus at the first federal election 1901 labors platform called for a  a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes labor has at various times supported high s and low tariffs  and  white australia and   and   and internationalism
historically labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the  which banned all non european migration to australia this policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about  and by fears of economic competition from low wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of australians and all major political parties in practice the party opposed all migration on the grounds that immigrants competed with australian workers and drove down wages until after  when the  launched a major immigration program the partys opposition to non european immigration did not change until after the retirement of  as leader in 1967 subsequently labor has become an advocate of  although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels

between the 2007 federal election and the  labor was in government nationally as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures this was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the act and the nt gained self governmentin 1969–1970 before the act and nt achieved self government the liberal and national coalition was in power federally and in all six states http  electionsuwaeduau  university of wa elections database  labor narrow lost government in western australia at the 2008 state election and victoria at the  these losses were further compounded by landslide defeats in new south wales in  queensland in  the northern territory in  federally in  and tasmania in   labor secured a good result in the australian capital territory in  and despite losing its majority the party retained government in south australia in  
however most of these reversals proved only temporary with labor returning to government in victoria in  and in queensland in  after spending only one term in opposition in both states  furthermore after winning the  by five votes from a 73 percent swing the labor government in south australia went from minority to majority government 
the policy of the australian labor party is contained in its national platform which is approved by delegates to labors national conference held every three years according to the labor partys website the platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees local branches unions state and territory governments and individual party members the platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal labor government 
the platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future labor government would follow but does not commit the party to specific policies it maintains that labors traditional values will remain a constant on which all australians can rely while making it clear that labor is fully committed to a market economy it says that labor believes in a strong role for national governmentampnbsp– the one institution all australians truly own and control through our right to vote labor will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands or located only in privileged communities the benefits must be shared by all australians and all our regions the platform and labor believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential for labor government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by ensuring equal opportunity removing unjustifiable discrimination and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth income and status further sections of the platform stress labors support for equality and human rights labour rights and democracy
in practice the platform provides only general policy guidelines to labors federal state and territory parliamentary leaderships the policy labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the cabinet if the party is in office or the shadow cabinet if it is in opposition in consultation with key interest groups within the party and is contained in the parliamentary leaders policy speech delivered during the election campaign when labor is in office the policies it implements are determined by the cabinet subject to the platform generally it is accepted that while the platform binds labor governments how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus it is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the partys parliamentary leadership as well as the factions however where there is a direct contradiction with the platform labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy for example privatisation legislation under the hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform
the  is the chief administrative authority of the australian labor party subject only to labors  the executive is responsible for organising the triennial national conference carrying out the decisions of national conference interpreting the national constitution the national platform and decisions of national conference and directing federal members 
the party holds a national conference every three years which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches many coming from affiliated trade unions although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference the national conference decides the partys platform elects the  and appoints office bearers such as the national secretary who also serves as national campaign director during elections the current national secretary is  the most recent national conference was the 47th conference held from 24 to 26 july 2015alp https  lab15orgau welcome to the 47th australian labor party national conference 
the head office of the alp the national secretariat is managed by the national secretary it plays a dual role of administration and national campaign strategy it acts as a permanent secretariat to the national executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party as the national secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections it is also responsible for national campaign strategy and organisation
the elected members of the labor party in both houses of the national parliament meet as the  besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics the caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders until 2013 the parliamentary leaders were elected by the caucus from among its members the leader has historically been a member of the house of representatives since october 2013 a ballot of both the caucus and by the labor partys rank and file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader  when the labor party is in government the party leader is the  and the deputy leader is the  if a labor prime minister resigns or dies in office the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected members of the ministry are also chosen by caucus though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers
 
the australian labor party is a federal party consisting of eight branches from each state and territory while the national executive is responsible for national campaign strategy each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal state and local elections state and territory branches consist of both individual members and s who between them decide the partys policies elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office
members join a state branch and pay a membership fee which is graduated according to income  the majority of  are affiliated to the party at a state level union affiliation is direct and not through the  affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership union affiliation fees make up a large part of the partys income another source of funds for the party are  and 
members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year although there are differences in the rules from state to state in practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings many members are only active during election campaigns
the members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences usually held annually although more frequent conferences are often held these conferences decide policy and elect state or territory executives a state or territory president an honorary position usually held for a one year term and a state or territory secretary a full time professional position however  directly elects its president the larger branches also have full time assistant secretaries and organisers in the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state however under recent national orms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches
in some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates in others it does not perring to allow its members to run as non endorsed candidates the process of choosing candidates is called  candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories in some they are chosen by ballots of all party members in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference in still others by a combination of these two
 
australian young labor is the youth wing of the australian labor party where all members under age 26 are automatically members it is the peak youth body within the alp former presidents of ayl have included former nsw premier bob carr federal manager of opposition business tony burke former special minister of state senator john faulkner former australian workers union national secretary and current member for maribyrnong and federal labor leader bill shorten as well as dozens of state ministers and mps the current national president is ben rillo from the south australian right
the labor party has always had a left wing and a right wing but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee the two largest factions are  on the right and the  labor unity generally supports free market policies and the us alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues the national left although it seldom openly espouses socialism favours more state intervention in the economy is generally less enthusiastic about the us alliance and is often more liberal on social issues the factions are themselves divided into sub factions primarily state based
labor affiliated trade unions are also factionally aligned the largest unions supporting the right are the  awu the  sda and the  twu important unions supporting the left include the  amwu  the  cfmeu the  asu and the  mua these affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent in some cases different union branches may have different factional alignments on other issues such as opposition to the s industrial relations policy most unions are in agreement
s are usually conducted along factional lines although sometimes a non factional candidate will be given perential treatment this happened with  in 1998 and again with  in 2004 deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place preselections particularly for safe labor seats can sometimes be strongly contested a particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of  signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots  multiple voting and on occasions fraudulent electoral enrolment trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections but party rules changes have stamped out this practice preselection results are sometimes challenged and the  is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes
the australian labor party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party examples of such groups include the   rainbow laborhttp  wwwrainbowlabororg pages   and labor for refugees  the tasmanian branch of the australian labor party recently gave these groups known as policy action caucuses voting and speaking rights at their state conference

the dodo is a  appearing in chapters 2 and 3 of the book  by  charles lutwidge dodgson the dodo is a caricature of the author a popular but unsubstantiated belief is that dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer and thus would accidentally introduce himself as do do dodgson name dead as a 
in this passage lewis carroll incorporated erences to the original boating expedition of 4 july 1862 during which alices adventures were first told with  as herself and the others represented by birds the  was lorina liddell  was edith liddell the dodo was dodgson and the  was rev   in order to get dry after a swim the dodo proposes that everyone run a caucus race — where the participants run in patterns of any shape starting and leaving off whenever they like so that everyone wins  at the end of the race alice distributes  from her pocket to all as prizes however this leaves no prize for herself  the dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket  as she has only a  the dodo requests it from her and then awards it to alice as her prize  the caucus race as depicted by carroll is a  on the   system mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness
in the disney film the dodo plays a much greater role in the story he is merged with the character of  which leads to him sometimes being nicknamed pat the dodo but this name is never mentioned in the film the dodo is also the leader of the caucus race a role originally held by the  he has the appearance and personality of a sea captain the dodo is voiced by  and animated by 
dodo is first seen as  is floating on the sea in a bottle dodo is seen singing but when alice asks him for help he does not notice her on shore dodo is seen on a rock organizing a caucus race this race involves running around until one gets dry but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves
dodo is later summoned by the  when the rabbit believes a monster actually alice having magically grown to a giant size is inside his home dodo brings  and attempts to get him to go down the chimney bill uses at first but dodo is able to convince him otherwise however the soot causes alice to sneeze sending bill high up into the sky dodo then decides to burn the house down much to the chagrin of the white rabbit he begins gathering wood such as the furniture for this purpose however alice is soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house
the white rabbit soon leaves while dodo asks for matches not realizing that the situation has been resolved he then asks alice for a match but when she doesnt have any dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire
the dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film conducting another caucus race
in s adaptation of  the dodos appearance retains the subtle apparent nature from s illustration he bears a down of brilliant blue and wears a blue coat and white spats along with glasses and a cane he is one of alices good willed advisers taking first note of her abilities as the true alice he is also one of the oldest inhabitants his name is uilleam and he is portrayed by michael gough he goes with the   and  to take alice to  to decide whether alice is the real one he is later captured by the s forces when alice came to the red queens castle he was seen at the red queens castle yard as a caddy for the queens croquet game after the red queen orders the release of the  he is then seen briefly running from it when the tweedles went to hide from it and escaped
his name may be based on a lecture on  from chapter three of the original novel the character is voiced by  in his final feature film role before his death in 2011 gough came out of retirement to appear in the film but the character only speaks three lines so gough managed to record in one day unlike most of the other creatures the dodo bird doesn’t appear in the end battle scene
in the anime and manga series  dodo is the chain of rufus barma one of the four dukedoms

albert of prussia 17 may 1490 – 20 march 1568 was the last  of the  who after converting to  became the first monarch of the  the secularized state that emerged from the former  albert was the first european ruler to establish lutheranism and thus  as the official  of his lands he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades 1510–1568
a member of the  branch of the  alberts election as grand master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the teutonic knights  he was a skilled political administrator and leader and did indeed reverse the decline of the teutonic order however albert who was sympathetic to the demands of  rebelled against the  and the  by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm the duchy of prussia for which he did homage to his uncle the  the arrangement was confirmed by the  in 1525 albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs
alberts rule in prussia was fairly prosperous although he had some trouble with the peasantry the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court he was active in imperial politics joining the  in 1526 and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor  after the issue of the  in may 1548 albert established schools in every town and founded  in 1544 he promoted culture and arts patronising the works of  and  alberts final years were clouded by peasant resentment of heavy taxes a step he felt compelled to take due to there no longer being any church land available to confiscate in prussia the intrigues of court favourites  and  also caused various religious and political disputes albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at  on 20 march 1568 his son  succeeded him as duke of prussia
alberts dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia paving the way for the rise of the house of hohenzollern he is theore often seen as the father of the prussian nation and even as indirectly responsible for the 
albert was born in  in  as the third son of  his mother was  daughter of  grand duke of  and king of  and his wife  he was raised for a career in the  and spent some time at the court of   who appointed him canon of the 
not only was he quite religious he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories his career was forwarded by the church however and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advance
turning to a more active life albert accompanied emperor  to  in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the 
 grand master of the  died in december 1510 albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle  grand duke of lithuania and king of poland would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern  which had been held by the order under polish  since the 
the new grand master aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy used to submit to the crown of poland as war over the orders existence appeared inevitable albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with emperor maximilian i the ill feeling influenced by the ravages of members of the order in poland culminated in  which began in december 1519 and devastated prussia albert was granted a four year truce early in 1521
the dispute was erred to emperor  and other princes but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war for this purpose he visited the  in 1522 where he made the acquaintance of the   by whose influence albert was won over to 
the grand master then journeyed to  where he was advised by  to abandon the rules of his order to marry and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself this proposal which was understandably appealing to albert had already been discussed by some of his relatives but it was necessary to proceed cautiously and he assured  that he was anxious to orm the order and punish the knights who had adopted  doctrines luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians while alberts brother margrave  laid the scheme before their uncle  of poland
after some delay sigismund assented to the offer with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a  albert pledged a  to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 february 1525
the  of the land then met at  and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther this transition did not however take place without protest summoned before the imperial court of justice albert used to appear and was proscribed while the order elected a new grand master  who received prussia as a fief at the imperial  as the german princes were experiencing the tumult of the reformation the  and the  they did not enforce the ban on the duke and agitation against him soon died away
in imperial politics albert was fairly active joining the  in 1526 he acted in unison with the protestants and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the  in may 1548 for various reasons however poverty and personal inclination among others he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period
the early years of alberts rule in prussia were fairly prosperous although he had some trouble with the peasantry the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life in 1544 in spite of some opposition he founded  where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in 1549 albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical  compiled by  and the first maps of prussia by 
this step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of alberts reign osianders divergence from luthers doctrine of  by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with  who had adherents in königsberg and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town the duke strenuously supported osiander and the area of the quarrel soon broadened there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles the burden of taxation was heavy and alberts rule became unpopular
after osianders death in 1552 albert favoured a preacher named  who with an adventurer named  exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of alberts early death and the need should that happen to appoint a  as his only son  was still a mere youth the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander and the climax came in 1566 when the  appealed to king  of poland alberts cousin who sent a commission to königsberg skalić saved his life by flight but funck was executed the question of the regency was settled and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers
virtually deprived of power the duke lived for two more years and died at  on 20 march 1568 of the plague along with his wife  designed his tomb within mühlpfordt p 73 
albert was a voluminous letter writer and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time
although albert has received relatively little recognition in german history his dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia which would eventually become arguably the most powerful german state and instrumental in uniting the whole of germany albert is theore often seen as the father of the prussian nation and even as indirectly responsible for the  he was a skilled political administrator and leader and effectively reversed the decline of the teutonic order until he betrayed it by transforming the orders lands into his own duchy secularizing it in the process
albert was the first german noble to support luthers ideas and in 1544 founded the  the albertina as a rival to the roman catholic  it was the second lutheran university in the german states after the 
a  of albert over the renaissance era portal of s southern wing was created by andreas hess in 1551 according to plans by christoph römer name m90mühlpfordt p 90  another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertinas original campus this depiction which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder was the popular albertus the symbol of the university the original was moved to  to protect it from the elements while the sculptor  created a duplicate for the wall name m90  another version of the albertus by lothar sauer was included at the entrance of the  name m90 
in 1880  created a sandstone bust of albert at the regierungsgebäude the administrative building for  on 19 may 1891 reusch premiered a famous statue of albert at  with the inscription albert of brandenburg last grand master first duke in prussiamühlpfordt p 82   also designed an equestrian statue of albert located at the new campus of the albertina  contains a statue of albert
albert was oft honored in the quarter  in northern königsberg its main street was named herzog albrecht allee in 1906 its town square könig ottokar platz was renamed herzog albrecht platz in 1934 to match its church the mühlpfordt p 133

agate  is a  variety of  chiefly  characterised by its fineness of grain and brightness of color although agates may be found in various kinds of rock they are classically associated with  rocks and can be common in certain  name wilder 
the stone was given its name by  a   and  who discovered the stone along the shore line of the river   in present day   sometime between the 4th and 3rd centuries bc   colorful agates and other  were obtained over 3000 years ago from the achates river now called 
agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of  and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites indicating its widespread use in the ancient world for example archaeological recovery at the  site on  illustrates its role in   culturec michael hogan 2007 http  wwwthemodernantiquariancom site 10854 knossoshtml#fieldnotes knossos fieldnotes modern antiquarian 
most agates occur as  in  rocks or ancient s in former cavities produced by  in the original molten mass which were then filled wholly or partially by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses such agates when cut  exhibit a succession of  lines often of extreme  giving a banded appearance to the section such stones are known as banded agate riband agate and striped agate
in the formation of an ordinary agate it is probable that waters containing  in solution—derived perhaps from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself—percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous coating on the interior of the  variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers so that bands of  often alternate with layers of crystalline  several vapour vesicles may unite while the rock is still  and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size thus a ian  lined with  and weighing 35ampnbsptons was exhibited at the  of 1902 perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by moxon cited below
the first deposit on the wall of a cavity forming the skin of the agate is generally a dark greenish mineral substance like   or  which are rich in  probably derived from the decomposition of the  in the enclosing volcanic rock this green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown   producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate nodule the outer  of an agate freed from its matrix is often pitted and rough apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating the first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the priming and upon this base  minerals may be deposited
many agates are hollow since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of  sometimes ine having the  of the s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal lined cavity or geode
when the matrix in which the agates are embedded disintegrates they are set free the agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the  or are deposited as  in streams and along shorelines
a mexican agate showing only a single eye has received the name of cyclops agate included matter of a green golden red black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth gives rise to dendritic or  dendritic agates have fern like patterns in them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides other types of included matter deposited during agate building include sagenitic growths radial mineral crystals and chunks of entrapped detritus such as sand ash or mud occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance  contains tiny inclusions of water sometimes with air bubbles
turritella agate is formed from silicified   erroneously considered  shells e tenera are spiral freshwater s having elongated spiral shells composed of many whorls similarly   and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized agatized coral is often erred to as  or agate
greek agate is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in  back to 400 bc the greeks used it for making jewelry and beads even though the stone had been around centuries and was known to both the sumerians and the egyptians both who used the gem for decoration and for playing important parts in their religious ceremonies any agate of this color from sicily once an ancient greek colony is called greek agate
another type of agate is brazilian agate which is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules these occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray quartz forms within these nodules creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis it is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes
certain stones when examined in s by transmitted light show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands whence they are termed rainbow agates often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process
other forms of agate include  carnelian agate has reddish hues botswana agate blue lace agate plume agate  tube agate with visible flow channels or pinhole sized tubes fortification agate with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts  showing internal flash or fire the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite and mexican crazy lace agate which often exhibits a brightly colored complexly banded pattern also called rodeo agate and rosetta stone depending on who owned the mine at the time
polyhedroid agate is agate which has grown in a flat sided shape similar to a plodowski g and werner r achate kleine senckenberg reihe no 12 1981 p 34 fig 20  when sliced it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric s polyhedroid agate is thought to be found only in  state brazil it has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling in of spaces between pre existing crystals which have since dissolvedodonoghue m quartz butterworth heinemann 1987 p 82 isbn 978 0408014625 
industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack it has traditionally been used to make knife edge bearings for s and precision pendulums and sometimes to make  to crush and mix chemicals it has also been used for centuries for  tools
the decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as  es or other types of  paper knives s  and  agate is also still used today for decorative displays cabochons beads carvings and  art as well as face polished and tumble polished specimens of varying size and origin  was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the european market this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century idar oberstein imported large quantities of agate from brazil as ships ballast making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes they produced colored beads that were sold around the globehttp  wwwfarlangcom art 2007 04 157721093142 background article on idar oberstein  agates have long been used in arts and crafts the sanctuary of a presbyterian church in  has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches

aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a  heart attack  one trial found that among those likely having a  aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30 day death rate from 118% to 94% name qu2009  there was no difference in major bleeding but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin name qu2009

studies have not found an overall benefit in the general population of healthy people although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past  one study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1667 from having a non fatal heart attack or stroke but caused 1 in 3333 to have a non fatal bleeding event however the people looked at were at relatively higher risk than most people who have never had a heart attack or stroke 
aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke—for instance those without a history of these events or with pre existing disease some studies recommend aspirin on a case by case basis name pmid19293073  name uspstf aspirin  while others have suggested the risks of other events such as gastrointestinal bleeding were enough to outweigh any potential benefit and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely  aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a  for prevention of cardiovascular disease name pmid16100022  name pmid16603580

reaction mechanism
formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like   because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions yielding salicylic and acetic acids 
 or the ability of a substance to form more than one  is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph for a long time only one crystal structure for aspirin was known that aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s the elusive second polymorph was first discovered by vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005  and fine structural details were given by bond et al  a new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and  from hot  the form ii is only stable at 100 and reverts to form i at ambient temperature in the unambiguous form i two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric  through the acetyl groups with the acidic  proton to  s and in the newly claimed form ii each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one with respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the  groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures
    
in 1971 british   then employed by the  in london showed aspirin suppressed the production of s and s   for this discovery he was awarded the 1982  jointly with  and   in 1984 he was made a 
aspirins ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the  cox officially known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ptgs enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a  residue in the active site of the ptgs enzyme this makes aspirin different from other nsaids such as  and  which are reversible inhibitors
low dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of  in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet 8–9 days this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks  40ampnbspmg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane asub2 sub release provoked acutely with the prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected however higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition 
prostaglandins local s produced in the body have diverse effects including the transmission of pain information to the brain modulation of the  thermostat and inflammation thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form  heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction
at least two different types of cyclooxygenase occur cox 1 and cox 2 aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox 1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox 2 cox 2 normally produces prostanoids most of which are proinflammatory aspirin modified ptgs2 produces lipoxins most of which are anti inflammatory  newer nsaid drugs s coxibs have been developed to inhibit only ptgs2 with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects name cox3article  
however several of the new cox 2 inhibitors such as  vioxx have been withdrawn in the last decade after evidence emerged that ptgs2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke   endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express ptgs2 and by selectively inhibiting ptgs2 prostaglandin production specifically pgi2 prostacyclin is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels as ptgs1 in platelets is unaffected thus the protective anticoagulative effect of  is removed increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems since platelets have no dna they are unable to synthesize new ptgs once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme an important difference with reversible inhibitors
aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action it uncouples  in cartilaginous and hepatic mitochondria by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix where it ionizes once again to release protons name somasundarams  in short aspirin buffers and transports the protons when high doses of aspirin are given it may actually cause fever owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses in addition aspirin induces the formation of no radicals in the body which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation this reduced leukocyte adhesion which is an important step in immune response to infection however evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection  more recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through   nf κb a  complex plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation
aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid which itself has anti inflammatory antipyretic and analgesic effects in 2012 salicylic acid was found to activate  which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin   the acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets acetylation of cellular proteins is a well established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post translational level aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to cox isoenzymes   these acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin
acetylsalicylic acid is a  and very little of it is  in the  after oral administration acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through cell membrane in the  conditions of the stomach the increased  and larger surface area of the  causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there as more of it is ionised owing to the formation of concretions aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose and  concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion name rk ferguson  name fl kaufman  name g levy 
about 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to  while the rest remains in the active ionized state protein binding is concentration dependent saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity the volume of distribution is 01–02 l kg acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates name g levy 
as much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is  in the  conjugation with  forms  and with  to form two different gluconuride esters the conjugate with the acetyl group intact is erred to as the acyl gluconuride the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic gluconuride these metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to  with large salicylate doses the kinetics switch from first order to zero order as s become saturated and  excretion becomes increasingly important name g levy 
salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid 75% free salicylic acid 10% salicylic phenol 10% and acyl glucuronides 5%   1% and 23 dihydroxybenzoic acid is a product of human aspirin metabolism martin grootveld and barry halliwell biochemical pharmacology volume 37 issue 2 15 january 1988 pages 271–280   when small doses less than 250ampnbspmg in an adult are ingested all pathways proceed by first order kinetics with an elimination half life of about 20 to 45 hours name o hartwig  name ak done  when higher doses of salicylate are ingested more than 4 g the half life becomes much longer 15–30 hours name chyka2007  because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated  renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated because it is extremely sensitive to changes in  ph a 10  to 20 fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine ph is increased from 5 to 8 the use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination name emergmed2002 dargan 
plant extracts including   and  of which salicylic acid was the  had been known to help alleviate headaches pains and fevers since antiquity the father of modern medicine  circa 460 – 377 bc left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms 
in 1763 edward stone at oxford isolated the active ingredient of aspirin in his discovery of salicylic acid a french chemist  was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853 in the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various s he mixed  with a  salt of salicylic acid  a vigorous reaction ensued and the resulting melt soon solidified name gerhardt  see especially pages 162 163  since no  existed at that time gerhardt called the compound he obtained salicylic acetic anhydride wasserfreie salicylsäure essigsäure this preparation of aspirin salicylic acetic anhydride was one of the many reactions gerhardt conducted for his paper on anhydrides and he did not pursue it further
six years later in 1859 von gilm obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid which he called acetylierte salicylsäure acetylated salicylic acid by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride name gilm  in 1869 schröder prinzhorn and kraut repeated both gerhardts from sodium salicylate and von gilms from salicylic acid syntheses and concluded both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid they were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygensee especially pages 9 13 the structural formula of acetylsalicylic acid appears on p 12 
in 1897 chemists working at bayer ag produced a synthetically altered version of  derived from the species  meadowsweet which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid the identity of the lead chemist on this project is a matter of controversy bayer states the work was done by  but the jewish chemist  later claimed he was the lead investigator and records of his contribution were expunged under the  regime name referencea   the new drug formally acetylsalicylic acid was named aspirin by bayer ag after the original  name for meadowsweet spiraea ulmaria derived from acetyl and spirsäure an old german name for salicylic acid derived from the latin spiraea ulmaria  by 1899 bayer was selling it around the world name jeffreys_73  the popularity of aspirin grew over the first half of the 20th century spurred by its supposed effectiveness in the wake of the  of 1918 however recent research suggests that the high death toll of the  though this is controversial and not universally accepted  
this theory gained support when a recent repetition of the 1918 flu outbreak with the same virus had a low fatality rate

in the  abner  אבנר avner meaning father of or is a light is cousin to  and commander in chief of his army 1 samuel 1450 2025 he is often erred to as abner ben ner meaning the son of 
abner is only erred to incidentally in sauls history 1 samuel 1755 265 first appearing as the commander who introduced  to saul following davids killing of  he is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous  when sauls power was crushed  seizing the youngest but only surviving of sauls sons  abner set him up as king over  at  east of the   who was accepted as king by  alone was meanwhile reigning at  and for some time war was carried on between the two parties
the only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at  between twelve chosen men from each side in which the whole twenty four seem to have perished 2 samuel 212  in the general engagement which followed abner was defeated and put to flight  he was closely pursued by  brother of  who is said to have been light of foot as a wild roe 2 samuel 218  as asahel would not desist from the pursuit though warned abner was compelled to slay him in self defence  this originated a deadly  between the leaders of the opposite parties for joab as next of kin to asahel was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood however according to josephus in antiquities book 7 chapter 1 joab had forgiven abner for the death of his brother asahel the reason being that abner had slain asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned asahel and had no other choice but to kill him out of self defense this battle was part of a civil war between david and ish bosheth the son of saul after this battle abner switched to the side of david and granted him control over the tribe of benjamin this act put abner in davids favor the real reason that joab killed abner was that he became a threat to his rank of general he then justifies it later by mentioning his brother
for some time afterward the war was carried on the advantage being invariably on the side of david  at length ish bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing abner of sleeping with  cf 2 samuel 37 one of sauls s an alliance which according to contemporary notions would imply pretensions to the  cf 2 samuel 1621ff
abner was indignant at the rebuke and immediately opened negotiations with david who welcomed him on the condition that his wife  should be restored to him this was done and the proceedings were ratified by a feast  almost immediately after however joab who had been sent away perhaps intentionally returned and slew abner at the gate of hebron  the ostensible motive for the  was a desire to avenge asahel and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time the conduct of david after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators 2 samuel 331 39 cf 1 kings 231ff
david had abner buried in  as it states in 2 samuel 331 32 and david said to all the people who were with him rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth and wail before abner and king david went after the bier and they buried abner in hebron and the king raised his voice and wept on abners grave and all the people wept and avner was buried in hevron and the king raised his voice and wept over avners grave and the whole nation cried  soon after abners death ish bosheth was assassinated as he slept 2 samuel 4 and david became king of the reunited kingdoms 2 samuel 5
the site known as the tomb of abner is located not far from the  in hebron and receives visitors throughout the year many travelers have recorded visiting the tomb over the centuries
 who began his journeys in 1165 wrote in the journal the valley of eshkhol is north of the mountain upon which hebron stood and the cave of makhpela is east thereof a bow shot west of the cave is the sepulchre of abner the son of ner 
a rabbi in the 12th century records visiting the tomb as reprinted in s book jewish travellers in the middle ages 19 firsthand accounts  the account states i jacob the son of r nathaniel ha cohen journeyed with much difficulty but god helped me to enter the holy land and i saw the graves of our righteous patriarchs in hebron and the grave of abner the son of ner adler postulates that the visit must have occurred prior to s capture of  in 1187
rabbi  records visiting the tomb in 1522 he states abners grave is in the middle of hebron the muslims built a mosque over it   another visitor in the 1500s states that at the entrance to the market in hebron at the top of the hill against the wall abner ben ner is buried in a church in a cave this visit was recorded in sefer yihus ha tzaddiqim book of genealogy of the righteous a collection of  from 1561 abraham moshe lunz reprinted the book in 1896 
menahem mendel of kamenitz   considered the first hotelier in the land of israel   wrote about the tomb of abner is his 1839 book korot ha itim which was translated into english as the book of the occurrences of the times to jeshurun in the land of israel he states here i write of the graves of the righteous to which i paid my respects hebron – described above is the character and order of behavior of those coming to pray at the cave of ha machpelah i went there between the stores over the grave of avner ben ner and was required to pay a yishmaeli – the grave was in his courtyard – to allow me to enter  
the author and traveler  mentioned visiting the tomb in his book eight years in asia and africa 1859 hanover he states on leaving the sepulchre of the patriarchs and proceeding on the road leading to the jewish quarter to the left of the courtyard is seen a turkish dwelling house by the side of which is a small grotto to which there is a descent of several steps this is the tomb of abner captain of king saul it is held in much esteem by the arabs and the proprietor of it takes care that it is always kept in the best order he requires from those who visit it a small gratuity  
the british scholar  wrote in his 1912 book the book of delight and other papers hebron was the seat of david’s rule over judea abner was slain here by joab and was buried here – they still show abner’s tomb in the garden of a large house within the city by the pool at hebron were slain the murderers of ishbosheth  
over the years the tomb fell into disrepair and neglect it was closed to the public in 1994 in 1996 a group of 12 israeli women filed a petition with the supreme court requesting the government to reopen the tomb of abner  more requests were made over the years   and eventually arrangements were made to have the site open to the general public on ten days throughout the year corresponding to the ten days that the isaac hall of the cave of the patriarchs is open  in early 2007 new  were affixed to the entrance of the site

due to the widespread violence of the jelali revolts a great number of people had fled their villages and a lot of villages were destroyed some military chiefs had claimed these abandoned villages as their property this deprived the porte of tax income and on 30 september 1609 ahmed i issued a letter guaranteeing the rights of the villagers he then worked on the resettlement of abandoned villages name islamans 
the new grand vizier nasuh pasha did not want to fight with the safavids the safavid shah also sent a letter saying that he was willing to sign a peace with which he would have to send 200 loads of silk every year to constantinople on 20 november 1612 the treaty of nasuh pasha signed which ceded all the lands the ottoman empire had gained in the war of 1578–90 back to persia and returned to the 1555 boundaries name islamans 
however the peace ended in 1615 when the shah did not send the 200 loads of silk on 22 may 1615 grand vizier  was assigned to organize an attack on persia mehmed pasha delayed the attack till the next year until when the safavids made their preparations and attacked ganja in april 1616 mehmed pasha left aleppo with a large army and marched to yerevan where he failed to take the city and withdrew to erzurum he was removed from his post and replaced by  halil pasha went for the winter to diyarbekir while the khan of crimea  attacked the areas of ganja nakhichevan and  name islamans 
ahmed i renewed trade treaties with england france and venice in july 1612 the first ever trade treaty with the  was signed he expanded the  given to france specifying that merchants from       and  could trade under the french flag name islamans 
ahmed is mother was   an ethnic  who was originally named helena he was born at  palace he succeeded his father  r 15951603 in 1603 at age 13 he broke with the traditional fratricide and sent his brother mustafa to live at the old palace at bayezit along with their grandmother safiye sultan he was known for his skills in fencing poetry horseback riding and fluency in numerous languages a half brother of ahmed  resented his accession to the ottoman throne in 1603 and spent his life scheming to become sultan
ahmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name bahti but while supportive of poetry he displayed an aversion to artistry and continued his fathers neglect of   this was connected to a devout religiosity that declared depiction of living things in art an immoral rivalry to s creation name heilbrunn  accordingly ahmed patronized scholars calligraphers and pious men hence he commissioned a book entitled the quintessence of histories to be worked upon by calligraphers he also attempted to enforce conformance to islamic laws and traditions restoring the old regulations that prohibited alcohol and he attempted to enforce attendance at  and paying alms to the poor in the proper way
he was responsible for the destruction of the musical clock organ that  sent to the court during the reign of his father name jardine  the reason for this may have been ahmeds religious objection to figurative art or the fact that the complex organ served as a daily reminder of the waxing influence and power of the west

ahmed ii  احمد ثانى aḥmed i us uānī span dir ltrfebruary 25 1643 – february 6 1695 span was the  of the  from 1691 to 1695 ahmed ii was born at   the son of sultan  164048 by   and succeeded his brother  168791 in 1691
during his short reign sultan ahmed ii devoted most of his attention to the wars against the habsburgs and related foreign policy governmental and economic issues of these the most important were the tax orms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system malikane see tax farming ahmed’s reign witnessed major military defeats against the austrian habsburgs in the long hungarian war of 1683–99 several devastating fires in istanbul and the emergence of ayan or local magnates which further weakened the central government’s hold over the provinces
among the most important features of ahmed’s reign was his reliance on köprülüzade fazıl mustafa pasha following his accession to the throne sultan ahmed ii confirmed köprülüzade fazıl mustafa pasha in his office as grand vizier in office from 1689 fazıl mustafa pasha was from the famous köprülü family of grand viziers and like most of his köprülü predecessors in the same office was an able administrator and military commander like his father köprülü mehmed pasha grand vizier 1656–61 before him he ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself he overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars he also ormed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the balkans and anatolia in october 1690 he recaptured belgrade northern serbia a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers danube and sava in ottoman hands since 1521 the fortress had been conquered by the habsburgs in 1688
fazıl mustafa pasha’s victory at belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the ottomans hope that the military debacles of the 1680s—which had led to the loss of hungary and transylvania an ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro istanbul hungarian princes— could be reversed however ottoman success proved ephemeral on august 19 1691 fazıl mustafa pasha suffered a devastating defeat at slankamen northwest of belgrade at the hands of ludwig wilhelm von baden the habsburg commander in chief in hungary fittingly nicknamed “türkenlouis” louis the turk for his splendid victories against the ottomans in the confrontation recognized by contemporaries as “the bloodiest battle of the century” the ottomans suffered heavy losses 20000 men including the grand vizier with him the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the köprülü family who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the ottoman military
under fazıl mustafa pasha’s successors the ottomans suffered further defeats in june 1692 the habsburgs conquered várad oradea romania the seat of an ottoman governor beylerbeyi since 1660 although the best habsburg forces were elsewhere fighting french invaders along the german rhine—part of the holy roman empire ruled by the austrian habsburgs—the ottomans were unable to regain their hungarian possessions in 1694 they tried to recapture várad but to no avail on january 12 1695 they gave up the fortress of gyula the center of an ottoman sancak or subprovince since 1566 with the fall of gyula the only territory still in ottoman hands in hungary was to the east of the river tisza and to the south of the river maros with its center at temesvár three weeks later on february 6 1695 ahmed ii died in  worn out by disease and sorrow
he married  and had two sons and two daughters

during the  1601–1868 the ainu became increasingly involved in trade with japanese who controlled the northern portion of the island that is now called hokkaido the  feudal government granted the  exclusive rights to trade with the ainu in the northern part of the island later the matsumae began to lease out trading rights to japanese merchants and contact between japanese and ainu became more extensive throughout this period ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by japanese and suffered from epidemic diseases such as  name brett l walker 2001 pages 49 56

the ainu were distributed in the northern and central islands of japan from sakhalin island in the north to the kuril islands and the island of hokkaido and northern honshū although some investigators place their former range as throughout honshū and as far north as the southern tip of the  in what is now  the island of hokkaido was known to the ainu as ainu moshir and was formally annexed by the japanese at the late date of 1868 partly as a means of preventing the intrusion of the russians and partly for imperialist reasons

during tsarist times the ainu living in russia were forbidden from identifying themselves as such since imperial japanese officials claimed that all the regions inhabited by the ainu in the past or present belonged to japan the terms kurile kamchatka kurile etc were used to identify the ethnic group during soviet times people with ainu surnames were sent to gulags and labor camps as they were often mistaken for japanese as a result large numbers of ainu changed their surnames to slavic ones after world war ii most of the ainu living in sakhalin were deported to japan of the 1159 ainu only around 100 remained in russia of those who remained only the elderly were full blooded ainu others were either mixed race or married to ethnic russians the last of the ainu households disappeared in the late 1960s when yamanaka kitaro committed suicide after the death of his wife the couple was childless  to eradicate ainu identity soviet authorities removed the ethnic group from the list of nationalities which could be mentioned in a soviet passport due to this children born after 1945 were not able to identify themselves as ainu the last known deportation of ainu to japan occurred in 1982 when keizo nakamura a full blooded northern kuril ainu was deported to hokkaido after serving 15 years hard labor in the province of  his wife tamara timofeevna pikhteevoi was of mixed sakhalin ainu and gilyak ancestry after the arrest of keizo in 1967 tamara and her son alexei nakamura were expelled from kamchatka krai and sent to the island of sakhalin to live in the city of  
unlike the other ainu clans currently living in russia there is considerable doubt whether the nakamura clan of kamchatka should be identified as northern kuril ainu southern kuril ainu or as kamchatka ainu this is due to the fact that the clan originally immigrated to kamchatka from  in 1789 the ainu of kunashir are south kuril ainu they settled down near  which was inhabited by the kamchatka ainu and north kuril ainu in 1929 the ainu of  fled to the island of  after an armed conflict with the soviet authorities at that time paramushir was under japanese rule during the  akira nakamura bampnbsp1897 was captured by the soviet army and his elder son takeshi nakamura 1925–45 was killed in the battle akiras only surviving son keizo bampnbsp1927 was taken prisoner and joined the soviet army after his capture after the war keizo went to  to work in the local harbor in 1963 he married tamara pikhtivoi a member of the sakhalin ainu tribe their only child alexei was born in 1964 the descendants of tamara and alexei are found in kamchatka and sakhalin
in 1979 the ussr removed the term ainu from the list of living ethnic groups of russia an act by which the government proclaimed that the ainu as an ethnic group were extinct in its territory according to the 2002 russian federation census no responders gave the ethnonym ainu in boxes 7 or 92 in the k 1 form of the censushttp  wwwperepis2002ru ct doc english 4 2xls 42 national composition of population for regions of the russian federation http  wwwperepis2002ru ct doc english 4 3xls 43 population by nationalities and knowledge of russian http  wwwperepis2002ru indexhtmlid 87 Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года   bot generated title     though some still might exist during the 2010 census of russia the authorities rejected the claim from a group of mostly mixed race ainu living in kamchatka that they were not extinct
the only ainu speakers remaining besides perhaps a few partial speakers live solely in japan there they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of hokkaido
due to intermarriage with the japanese and ongoing absorption into the predominant culture there are no truly ainu settlements existing in japan today the town of   niputay in hidaka area hokkaido pecture has a number of ainu households and a visit to some of the ainu owned craft shops close to the ainu museums there are two of them in nibutani is an opportunity to interact with the ainu people many authentic ainu villages advertised in hokkaido such as  and  are tourist attractions and provide an opportunity to see and meet ainu people
today it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remainhohmann s 2008 the ainus modern struggle in world watch vol 21 no 6 pp 20–24  while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers the language has been classified as “endangered” 1993 a reconstruction of proto ainu brill p 3  as a result of this the study of the ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research
although there have been attempts to show that the ainu language and the japanese language are related modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact such as the mutual borrowing of words between japanese and ainu in fact no attempt to show a relationship with ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance and ainu is currently considered to be a  name shibatani  
words used as prepositions in english such as to from by in and at are postpositional in ainu they come after the word that they modify a single sentence in ainu can be made up of many added or d sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas
the ainu language has had no system of writing and has historically been transliterated by the japanese  or   today it is typically written in either  or  the unwieldy nature of the japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent  consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original ainu for example some words such as kor meaning to hold are now pronounced with a terminal vowel sound as in koro
many of the ainu dialects even from one end of hokkaido to the other were not mutually intelligible however the classic ainu language of the  or ainu epic stories was understood by all without a writing system the ainu were masters of narration with the yukar and other forms of narration such as the  uwepeker tales being committed to memory and related at gatherings often lasting many hours or even daysomniglot 2009 ainu retrieved august 2 2009 http  wwwomniglotcom writing ainuhtm   ethnologue data is incorrect see

instead of using furniture they sat on the floor which was covered with two layers of mats one of rush the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves  whose english names include water flag and for beds they spread planks hanging mats around them on poles and employing skins for coverlets the men used s when eating the women had wooden s  is not commonly eaten outside ainu communities there are only a few ainu run restaurants in japan all located in tokyo or hokkaido serving primarily japanese fare

the ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer the reasons for this were among others that in late autumn  salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered a village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory iwor heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory the ainu hunted bear ezo deer a subspecies of  rabbit fox  and other animals ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the ainu as were  they also hunted s such as s  and other birds the ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers which they used in trade with the japanese the ainu hunted with s and s with poison coated points they obtained the  called  from the roots and stalks of  the recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family they enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dogs bane boiled juice of mekuragumo matsumomushi tobacco and other ingredients they also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers they hunted in groups with dogs before the ainu went hunting for animals like bear in particular they prayed to the  and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch and safe hunting to the god of mountains
the ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw at that time bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens when they hunted bear in summer they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow called an amappo the ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer also they often used traps including spring traps loaded with arrows also they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows for a large catch a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death

cise or cisey houses in a kotan were made of   s etc the length lay east to west or parallel to a river a house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom the house had three windows including the rorun puyar a window located on the side facing the entrance at the east side through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out the ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it a house had a fireplace near the entrance the husband and wife sat on the fireplaces left side called shiso  children and guests sat facing them on the fireplaces right side called harkiso the house had a platform for valuables called iyoykir behind the shiso the ainu placed shintoko hokai and ikayop quivers there
outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ashinru and for women called menokoru a pu storehouse for food a heper set cage for young bear and drying racks for fish and wild plants an altar nusasan faced the east side of the house rorunpuyar the ainu held such ceremonies there as  a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods

in   aeneas     aineías possibly derived from greek  meaning praised was a   the son of the prince  and the goddess  aphrodite his father was the  of king  of troy making aeneas priams second cousin once removed he is a character in  and is mentioned in s  aeneas receives full treatment in  most extensively in s  where he is an ancestor of  he became the first true hero of rome
the story of the birth of aeneas is told in the hymn to aphrodite one of the major  aphrodite has caused the other gods especially  to fall in love with mortal women in retaliation zeus puts desire in her heart for anchises who is tending his cattle among the hills near  when aphrodite sees him she is smitten she adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him he is overcome by her beauty believing that she is a goddess but aphrodite identifies herself as a n princess after they make love aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison aphrodite assures him that he will be protected and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called aeneas however she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess when aeneas is born aphrodite takes him to the s of mount ida she directs them to raise the child to age five then take him to anchiseshomeric hymn to aphrodite trans by gregory nagy university of houston  according to other sources anchises later brags about his encounter with aphrodite and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by zeus thereafter he is lame in that foot so that aeneas has to carry him from the flames of troyvirgil the aeneid 
aeneas is a minor character in the  where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as yet unknown destiny but is a warrior in his own right having held back from the fighting aggrieved with priam because in spite of his brave deeds he was not given his due share of honour he leads an attack against idomeneus to recover the body of his brother in law alcathous at the urging of http  wwwgutenbergorg files 2199 2199 h 2199 hhtm homer the iliad book xiii samuel butler trans  he is the leader of the trojans ian allies as well as a third cousin and principal lieutenant of  son of the trojan king  aeneass mother  frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield and he is a favorite of  aphrodite and apollo rescue aeneas from combat with  of  who nearly kills him and carry him away to  for healing even  who normally favors the greeks comes to aeneass rescue after he falls under the assault of  noting that aeneas though from a junior branch of the royal family is destined to become king of the trojan people bruce louden presents aeneas as a type in the tradition of   and  the just man spared the general destructionhttps  camwsorg meeting 2006 abstracts loudenhtml louden bruce aeneas in the iliad the one just man 102nd annual meeting of camws classical association of the middle west and south 2006  apollodorus explains that the greeks let him alone on account of his pietyhttp  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textdoc perseus%3atext%3a1999010022%3atext%3depitome%3abook%3de%3achapter%3d5%3asection%3d21 apollodorus epitome james g frazer ed chapv 21 
the roman mythographer  c 64 bce – ce 17 in his fabulaehyginus  115  credits aeneas with killing 28 enemies in the trojan war aeneas also appears in the trojan narratives attributed to  and 
 tells of the trojans in the prologue to his http  heimskringlano wiki prologus  he tells of a king of troja  or  who marries the daughter of the high king yfirkonungr  called  they got a son  who as snorri tells is identical to  it is interesting that in the same prologue snorri tells of the world as parted in three continents   and the third part is called  and enea as well thus it is possible to identify or equate the norse Æsir  with aeneas even to argue that snorri sturlason does so
the history of aeneas was continued by roman authors one influential source was the account of romes founding in s   the aeneas legend was well known in virgils day and appeared in various historical works including the roman antiquities of the greek historian  relying on   by  probably dependent on  fl 200 bce and  now extant only in an epitome by 
the aeneid explains that aeneas is one of the few trojans who were not killed or enslaved when troy fell aeneas after being commanded by the gods to flee gathered a group collectively known as the  who then traveled to  and became progenitors of  the aeneads included aeneass trumpeter  his father  his friends   and  the healer  the helmsman  and his son  also known as iulus julus or ascanius julius he carried with him the  and  the statues of the household gods of troy and transplanted them to italy
several attempts to find a new home failed one such stop was on  where in  on the islands western coast his father anchises died peacefully
after a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at s request aeneas and his fleet made landfall at  after six years of wanderings  aeneas had a year long affair with the carthaginian queen  also known as elissa who proposed that the trojans settle in her land and that she and aeneas reign jointly over their peoples a marriage of sorts was arranged between dido and aeneas at the instigation of juno who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the trojans descendants aeneass mother  the roman adaptation of aphrodite realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come however the messenger god  was sent by  and venus to remind aeneas of his journey and his purpose compelling him to leave secretly when dido learned of this she uttered a curse that would forever pit carthage against rome an enmity that would culminate in the  she then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave aeneas when they first met
after the sojourn in carthage the trojans returned to sicily where aeneas organized  to honor his father who had died a year before the company traveled on and landed on the western coast of italy aeneas descended into the underworld where he met dido who turned away from him to return to her husband and his father who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of rome
 king of the latins welcomed aeneass army of exiled trojans and let them reorganize their lives in  his daughter  had been promised to  king of the  but latinus received a prophecy that lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land ampmdash namely aeneas latinus heeded the prophecy and turnus consequently declared war on aeneas at the urging of juno who was aligned with king  of  and queen  of the latins aeneass forces prevailed turnus was killed and virgils account ends abruptly
the rest of aeneass biography is gleaned from other ancient sources including livy and ovids metamorphoses according to livy aeneas was victorious but latinus died in the war aeneas founded the city of  named after his wife he later welcomed didos sister  who then committed suicide after learning of lavinias jealousy after aeneass death venus asked jupiter to make her son immortal jupiter agreed the river god  cleansed aeneas of all his mortal parts and venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar making him a god aeneas was recognized as the god http  mcadamsposcmuedu txt ah livy livy01html titus livius the history of rome rev canon roberts trans vol i j m dent amp sons ltd london 1905 
continuations of trojan matter in the middle ages had their effects on the character of aeneas as well the 12th century french  addresses aeneass sexuality though virgil appears to deflect all homoeroticism onto  making his aeneas a purely heterosexual character in the middle ages there was at least a suspicion of homoeroticism in aeneas the roman denéas addresses that charge when  opposes aeneass marrying  claiming that aeneas loved boys 
medieval interpretations of aeneas were greatly influenced by both virgil and other latin sources specifically the accounts by dares and dictys which were reworked by 13th century italian writer  in  colored many later readings from guido for instance the  and other english writers get the suggestion name tolkien  that aeneass safe departure from troy with his possessions and family was a reward for treason for which he was chastised by   in  late 14th century the pearl poet like many other english writers employed aeneas to establish a genealogy for the foundation of britain name tolkien  and explains that aeneas was impeached for his perfidy proven most true line 4 in marie boroffs translation edited by laura howes the treacherous knight of line 3 is identified as  incorrectly as tolkien argues

amaranthus collectively known as amaranth  is a   of  or short lived s some amaranth species are cultivated as s s and s most of the species from amaranthus are summer annual weeds and are commonly erred to as  name   benschbensch et al 2003 interference of redroot pigweed amaranthus retroflexus palmer amaranth a palmeri and common waterhemp a rudis in soybean weed science 51 37 43 
 like  of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn  approximately 60  are recognized with s and foliage ranging from purple and red to green or gold members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus 
amaranth derives from    amarantos unfading with the greek word for flower ἄνθος anthos factoring into the words development as amaranth the more accurate amarant is an archaic variant
amaranthus shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species although the family  is distinctive the  has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included name multiple  this complicates  and amaranthus has generally been considered among systematists as a difficult genus name   costea 
formerly sauer 1955 classified the genus into two subgenera differentiating only between  and  species acnida l aellen ex kr robertson and amaranthus name costea   although this classification was widely accepted further infrageneric classification was and still is needed to differentiate this widely diverse group
currently amaranthus includes three recognized subgenera and 70 species although species numbers are questionable due to  and species conceptsjudd et al 2008 plant systematics a phylogenetic approach third edition sinauer associates inc sunderland ma  infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence flower characters and whether a species is monoecious dioecious as in the sauer 1955 suggested classification name multiple   a modified infrageneric classification of amaranthus was published by mosyakin amp robertson 1996 and includes three subgenera acnida amaranthus and albersia the taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera

in  agamemnon   from Ἀγαμέδμων from ἄγαν very much and  think on etymological dictionary of greek brill 2009 p 8  very steadfast was the son of king  and queen  of  the brother of  the husband of  and the father of   or laodike Λαοδίκη  and  iliad 9145  mythical legends make him the king of mycenae or  thought to be different names for the same area when  the wife of menelaus ran off with   agamemnon commanded the united greek armed forces in the ensuing 
upon agamemnons return from troy he was murdered according to the oldest surviving account  11409–11 by  the lover of his wife clytemnestra in old versions of the story the scene of the murder when it is specified is usually the house of aegisthus who has not taken up residence in agamemnons palace and it involves an ambush and the deaths of agamemnons followers as wellaeschylus 1986 choephori introduction by a f garvie oxford u p p x  in some later versions clytemnestra herself does the killing or they do it together in his own home
 sources mention  ruler of  land of ns in the 14th century bcsteiner gerd https  securepeeters leuvenbe poj downloadpdfphpticket_id 47d8d1970ea7b the case of wiluša and ahhiyawa bibliotheca orientalis lxiv no 5 6 september–december 2007   this is a possible prototype of the agamemnon of mythology
 agamemnons father murdered the children of twin brother  and fed them to thyestes after discovering thyestes  with his wife aerope thyestes fathered  with his own daughter  and this son vowed gruesome revenge on atreus children aegisthus successfully murdered atreus and restored his father to the throne aegisthus took possession of the throne of mycenae and jointly ruled with thyestes 
during this period agamemnon and his brother  took uge with  king of  there they respectively married tyndareus daughters  and helen  agamemnon and clytemnestra had four children one son  and three daughters   and  
menelaus succeeded tyndareus in sparta while agamemnon with his brothers assistance drove out aegisthus and thyestes to recover his fathers kingdom he extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in greece
agamemnons family history had been tarnished by    and  consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor  and then of a curse placed upon  son of  by  whom he had murdered thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the  until atoned by  in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods
agamemnon gathered the reluctant greek forces to sail for  preparing to depart from  which was a port in  agamemnons army incurred the wrath of the goddess  there are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath in  play  artemis is angry for the young men who will die at troy whereas in   agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to artemis and subsequently boasted that he was artemis equal in hunting misfortunes including a  and a lack of wind prevented the army from sailing 
finally the prophet  announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of agamemnons daughter  
classical dramatisations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to  but agamemnon did eventually sacrifice iphigenia her death appeased artemis and the greek army set out for troy several alternatives to the  have been presented in greek mythology 
other sources such as  claim that agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter but that artemis accepted a deer in her place and whisked her away to  in the   said she became the goddess 
agamemnon was the  of the greeks during the trojan war during the fighting agamemnon killed  and fifteen other trojan soldiers  114  the  tells the story about the quarrel between agamemnon and  in the final year of the war following one of the achaean armys raids  daughter of  one of apollos priests was taken as a war prize by agamemnon chryses pleaded with agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success chryses then prayed to apollo for the safe return of his daughter which apollo responded to by unleashing a plague over the achaean army after learning from the prophet calchas that the plague could be dispelled by returning chryseis to her father agamemnon reluctantly agreed and released his prize however as compensation for his lost prize agamemnon demanded a new prize as a result agamemnon stole an attractive slave called  one of the spoils of war from achilles homer iliad translated by robert fagles penguin classics 1998 
achilles the greatest warrior of the age withdrew from battle in response to agamemnons supposedly evil deed and allegedly put the greek armies at risk of losing the war agamemnon having realized achilless importance in winning the war against the trojan army sent ambassadors begging for achilles to return offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage but achilles used only being spurred back into action when his closest friend patroclus is killed in battle 
although not the equal of achilles in bravery agamemnon was a representative of kingly authority as commander in chief he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle he was the sole fighter on the field and he fought on until he was wounded and forced to withdraw to his tent
his chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness an over exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult  and achilles thereby bringing great disaster upon the greeks
after the capture of troy  the doomed prophetess and daughter of  fell to agamemnons lot in the distribution of the prizes of war
after a stormy voyage agamemnon and cassandra either landed in  or were blown off course and landed in aegisthus country  agamemnons wife had taken  son of  as a lover  
when agamemnon came home he was slain by either aegisthus in the oldest versions of the storyhomer  3266  or clytemnestra 
according to the accounts given by  and the tragedians agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone a blanket of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistanceaeschylus agamemnon 1389  clytemnestra also killed cassandra her jealousy of cassandra and her wrath at the sacrifice of iphigenia and at agamemnons having gone to war over helen of troy are said to have been the motives for her crime 
aegisthus and clytemnestra then ruled agamemnons kingdom for a time aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for agamemnons father atreus having fed thyestes his own children thyestes then crying out so perish all the race of pleisthenesaeschylus agamemnon 1602  thus explaining aegisthus action as justified by his fathers curse 
agamemnons son  later avenged his fathers murder with the help or encouragement of his sister  by murdering aegisthus and clytemnestra his own mother thereby inciting the wrath of the   the furies winged goddesses who tracked down egregiously impious wrongdoers with their hounds noses and drove them to insanity
 tells a tale of how agamemnon mourned the loss of his friend argynnus when he drowned in the  river name argynnusld  he buried him honored with a tomb and a shrine to  argynnisthe deipnosophists of  book xiii concerning women 80d p 603  this episode is also found in clement of alexandria  ii382  in  kopai and argunnos and in  iii with minor variationsbutler harold edgeworth amp barber eric arthur eds 1933 the elegies of propertius oxford clarendon press p 277 
 
the fortunes of agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous  ancient and modern the most famous being the  of  in the legends of the  agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch and in  he was worshipped under the title of  his tomb was pointed out among the ruins of mycenae and at 
another account makes him the son of  the son or father of  who is said to have been aeropes first husband
in works of art there is considerable resemblance between the representations of  king of the gods and agamemnon king of men he is generally depicted with a  and  conventional attributes of kings
agamemnons mare was named aetha  she was also one of two horses driven by  at the funeral games of  description of greece 583  amores 21 
following his death at the hands of aegisthus agamemnon made an appearance in homers odyssey within the kingdom of hades there the former king met odysseus and explained just how he was murdered before he offered odysseus a warning about the dangers of trusting a woman homer odyssey 11 485 486 
agamemnon is the subject of two novels by  warrior in bronze 1977 about agamemnons rise to the throne of mycenae and its sequel the king in splendour 1979 about agamemnon and the trojan war
agamemnon is portrayed as the treacherous king of mykene in the troy trilogy of david gemmell

agathon   gen Ἀγάθωνος c 448  c 400 bc was an  tragic poet whose works have been lost  he is best known for his appearance in s  which describes the  given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first  at the  in 416  he is also a prominent character in  comedy the 
agathon was the son of tisamenus name ocd  and the lifelong companion of  with whom he appears in both the symposium and platos pierre leveque agathon paris societe dedition les belles lettres 1955 pp 163 4   together with pausanias he later moved to the court of  king of  who was recruiting playwrights it is here that he probably died around 401 bc agathon introduced certain innovations into the greek theater  tells us in the  1456a that the characters and plot of his  were original and not following athenian dramatic orthodoxy borrowed from mythological subjectsaristotle poetics 9   agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays
agathon is portrayed by plato as a handsome young man well dressed of polished manners courted by the fashion wealth and wisdom of athens and dispensing hospitality with ease and inement the  speech in praise of love which agathon recites in the symposium is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of   in the symposium agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet aristophanes but this alleged friendship did not prevent aristophanes from harshly criticizing agathon in at least two of his comic plays the thesmophoriazousae and the now lost gerytades  in the later play frogs aristophanes softens his criticisms but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on agathons name ἁγαθός good that he makes dionysus call him a good poet
agathon was also a friend of  another recruit to the court of archelaus of macedon
agathons extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources the historian w rhys roberts observes that ὁ καλός Ἀγάθων ho kalos agathon has become almost a stereotyped phrase   the most detailed surviving description of agathon is in the thesmophoriazousae in which agathon appears as a pale clean shaven young man dressed in womens clothes  scholars are unsure how much of aristophanes portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention
after a close reading of the thesmophoriazousae the historian jane mcintosh snyder observed that agathons costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet  as he is portrayed in early 5th century vase paintings  snyder theorizes that agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow poet although by agathons time such clothing especially the κεκρύφαλος kekryphalos an elaborate covering for the hair had long fallen out of fashion for men  according to this interpretation agathon is mocked in the thesmophoriazousae not only for his notorious effeminacy but also for the pretentiousness of his dress he seems to think of himself in all his elegant finery as a rival to the old ionian poets perhaps even to anacreon himself 
agathon has been thought to be the subject of lovers lips an  attributed to plato
kissing agathon i had my soul upon my lips for it rose poor wretch as though to cross over
a looser translation reads
kissing agathon i found my soul at my lips poor thing it went there hoping  to slip across
although the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries it was probably not composed for agathon the tragedian nor was it composed by plato  stylistic evidence suggests that the poem with most of platos other alleged epigrams was actually written some time after plato had died its form is that of the hellenistic erotic epigram which did not become popular until after 300 bc  according to 20th century scholar walther ludwig the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of plato sometime between 250 bc and 100 bc and adopted by later writers from this source

agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the  shortly after 398 bc name dgrbm   then in 396 bc agesilaus crossed into asia with a force of 2000  freed  and 6000 allies including 30 spartiates to liberate  cities from  dominion  on the eve of sailing from  he attempted to offer a sacrifice as  had done before the  expedition but the  intervened to prevent it an insult for which he never forgave them  on his arrival at  a three months truce was concluded with  the  of  and  but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless and on its termination agesilaus raided  where he easily won immense booty from the satrap  tissaphernes could offer no assistance as he had concentrated his troops in caria in these campaigns agesilaus also benefited from the aid of the  a mercenary army who marched through miles of persian territory to reach the black sea after spending the winter organizing a  force  he made a successful incursion into  in the spring of 395 bc   was sent to replace tissaphernes who paid with his life for his continued failure  an armistice was concluded between tithraustes and agesilaus who left the southern y and again invaded  which he ravaged until the following spring  he then came to an agreement with pharnabazus and once more turned southward name dgrbm 
during these campaigns  attempted to manipulate agesilaus into ceding his authority agesilaus the former passive lover of lysander would have nothing of this and reminded lysander who was only a spartan general who was king he had lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the  this dominating move by agesilaus earned the respect of his men at arms and of lysander himself who remained emotionally close with agesilaus name referencea 
in 394 bc while encamped on the  he was planning a campaign in the interior or even an attack on  himself when he was recalled to  owing to the war between  and the combined forces of     and several minor states  a rapid march through  and ia brought him to  where he repulsed the thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him  reinforced by  and  troops and a spartan army he met the confederate forces at  in  and in a  was technically victorious however the spartan baggage train was ransacked and agesilaus himself was injured during the fighting resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of  to the  shortly before this battle the spartan  of which he had received the supreme command was totally defeated off  by a powerful persian fleet under  and  name livius 
during these conflicts in mainland greece  perished while attacking the walls of   the second king of sparta see  for more information on spartas dual monarchy was supposed to provide lysander with reinforcements as they marched into  yet failed to arrive in time to assist lysander likely because pausanias disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the spartan royalty and government pausanias failed to fight for the bodies of the dead and because he retrieved the bodies under truce a sign of defeat he was disgraced and banished from sparta name referencea 
in 393 bc agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of   in 392 bc he took a prominent part in the  making several successful expeditions into corinthian territory and capturing  and   the loss however of a battalion mora destroyed by  neutralized these successes and agesilaus returned to sparta  in 389 bc he conducted a campaign in  but two years later the  warmly supported by agesilaus put an end to hostilities  in this interval agesilaus declined command over spartas aggression on  and justified  seizure of the theban  so long as the outcome provided glory to sparta name dgrbm  name referencea 
when war broke out afresh with thebes agesilaus twice invaded  in 378 bc and 377 bc although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness  in the congress of 371 bc an altercation is recorded between him and the theban general  and due to his influence thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace and orders given for  to march against thebes in 371 bc  cleombrotus was defeated at  and the spartan supremacy overthrown name livius 
in 370 bc agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to  and reassured the spartans with an invasion of   he preserved an un walled sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of s  and even other spartans and against external enemies with four different armies led by  penetrating  that same year again in 362 bc epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march  the  in which agesilaus took no part was followed by a general peace sparta however stood aloof hoping even yet to recover her supremacy  according to  agesilaus ii 26 27  agesilaus in order to gain money for prosecuting the war supported the   in his revolt against  in 364 bc  and in 361 bc he went to  at the head of a  force to aid the king  and his regent  against persia  he soon transferred his services to teoss cousin and rival  who in return for his help gave him a sum of over 200   on his way home agesilaus died in  around the age of 84 after a reign of some 41 years  his body was embalmed in wax and buried at sparta name dgrbm 
agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance and was lame from birth these facts were used as an argument against his succession an  having warned sparta against a lame reign  most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in  alert and quick yet cautious—a man moreover whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time  of his courage temperance and hardiness many instances are cited and to these were added the less spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend  as examples there is the story of his riding across a stick horse made of stick with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children and because of the affection of his son  for  he saved  cleonymus father from execution for his incursion into the  and dishonorable retreat in 378 bc name dgrbm   modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of agesilaus reputation and achievements reckoning him an excellent soldier but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and  name ocd 
as a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies  agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in asia and in extreme age maintaining his prostrate country  other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to spartan decline notably his unremitting hatred of thebes which led to spartas humiliation at the  and thus the end of spartan hegemony name ocd 
other historical accounts paint agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader his awareness thoughtfulness and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic greek commander these historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by lysander in the former athenian empire and the failures of spartan leaders such as pausanias and kleombrotos for the eventually suppression of spartan power the ancient historian  was a huge admirer and served under agesilaus during the campaigns into  name referencea

vipsania agrippina most commonly known as agrippina major or agrippina the elder major latin for the elder  smallagrippina•germanici small edd prosopographia imperii romani saeculi i ii et iii pir berlin 1933   v 463  14 bce – 17 october 33 was a distinguished and prominent  woman of the first centuryampnbspce agrippina was the wife of the general and statesman  and a relative to the  
she was the second granddaughter of the emperor  name salisbury2001  sister in law stepdaughter and daughter in law of the emperor  mother of the emperor  maternal second cousin and sister in law of the emperor  and the maternal grandmother of the emperor 
agrippina was born as the second daughter and fourth child to roman statesman and augustus’ ally  and  agrippina’s mother julia was the only natural child born to augustus from his second marriage to noblewoman 
her father’s marriage to julia was his third marriage from agrippa’s previous two marriages agrippina had at least two half sisters  and  agrippina although suet div aug 63 implies more vipsania agrippina was agrippa’s second child from his first marriage to  known from nep att 19 she became tiberiuss first wife and was the mother of his natural son 
vipsania agrippina later married senator and consul  after tiberius was forced to divorce her and marry   less well known is agrippa’s oldest daughter   vipsania marcella  she was the first wife   agrippa likely had more children some of whom did not survive from his second marriage to augustus’ niece and paternal cousin to julia the elder  major  no son is attested but a daughter is possibly the mother of dec haterius agrippa cos ce 22 called a relative of germanicus by tac ann 249
her mother’s marriage to agrippa was her second marriage as julia the elder was widowed from her first marriage to her paternal cousin  and they had no children from the marriage of julia and agrippa agrippina had four full blood siblings a sister  and three brothers   and  agrippina was born in  as in the year of her birth agrippa was in that city completing official duties on behalf of augustus her mother and her siblings had traveled with agrippa later agrippina’s family returned to 
in 12 bce agrippina’s father died  augustus had forced his first stepson tiberius to end his happy first marriage to vipsania agrippina to marry julia the elder the marriage of julia and tiberius was not a happy one in 2 bce augustus exiled agrippina’s mother on the grounds that she had committed adultery thereby causing a major scandal julia was banished for her remaining years and agrippina never saw her again  tiberius had left rome for the  island of  ca 6 bce allegedly to avoid any scandal  in his absence augustus arranged the divorce between tiberius and julia and sent word of it to rhodes
with her siblings agrippina was raised in rome by her maternal grandfather and maternal step grandmother  drusilla livia was the first roman empress and was augustus’ second or third wife augustus briefly had a child bride livia had two sons by her first marriage to praetor   the future emperor tiberius and the general 
according to  as a member of the imperial family agrippina was expected to display frugality chastity and domesticity all traditional virtues for a noble roman woman agrippina and augustus had a close relationship
between 1 bce 5 agrippina married her second maternal cousin  name salisbury2001  germanicus was the first son born to  and  antonia minor was the second daughter born to  and triumvir  hence antonia’s maternal uncle was augustus germanicus was a popular general and politician augustus ordered tiberius to adopt germanicus as his son and heir name salisbury2001  germanicus was always favored by his great uncle and hoped that he would succeed tiberius who had been adopted by augustus as his heir and successor agrippina and germanicus were devoted to each other she was a loyal affectionate wife who supported her husband the roman historian  states that agrippina had an ‘impressive record as wife and mother’
agrippina and germanicus in their union had nine children of whom three died young the six children who survived to adulthood were the sons   and  gaius julius caesar germanicus and the daughters  julia agrippina  and  caligula would become future roman emperor agrippina the younger would become a future roman empress and mother to the later emperor nero their children were born at various places throughout the roman empire and agrippina acquired a well deserved reputation for successful childbearing eventually agrippina was proud of her large family and this was a part of the reason she was popular with roman citizens
according to suetonius who had cited from  agrippina had borne to germanicus a son called gaius julius caesar who had a lovable character this son died young the child was born at treveri near the village of ambitarvium just before the junction of the  and the  river modern  germany at this spot there were local altars inscribed as a dedication to agrippina “in honor of agrippina’s ”
germanicus was a candidate for future succession and had won fame campaigning in  and  during the military campaigns agrippina accompanied germanicus with their children agrippina’s actions were considered unusual as for a roman wife because a conventional roman wife was required to stay home agrippina had earned herself a reputation as a heroic woman and wife during her time in germania agrippina had proved herself to be an efficient and effective diplomat agrippina had reminded germanicus on occasion of his relation to augustus
a few months before augustus’ death in 14 the emperor wrote and sent a letter to agrippina mentioning a child who must be future emperor caligula because at that time no other child had this name
the letter reads
agrippina and germanicus travelled to the  in 19 incurring the displeasure of  germanicus quarreled with  the governor of  and died in  in mysterious circumstances it was widely suspected that germanicus had been poisoned or perhaps on the orders of tiberius with agrippina believing he was assassinated name salisbury2001  agrippina was in grief when germanicus died she returned with her children to  with germanicus’ ashes the roman citizens had great sympathy for agrippina and her family she returned to rome to avenge his death and boldly accused piso of the murder of germanicus according to tacitus annals 3141 the prosecution could not prove the poisoning charge but other charges of treason seemed likely to stick and piso committed suicide
from 19 to 29 agrippina lived on the  in rome her remaining children were raised between her  drusilla and germanicus’ mother  agrippina had become lonely distressed physically ill and many of her relatives had died agrippina had a hasty uncomfortable relationship with tiberius and possibly with tiberius’ mother livia she became involved in politics in tiberius’ imperial court became an advocate for her sons to succeed tiberius and opposed tiberius’ natural son and natural grandson  for succession
she was unwise in her complaints about germanicus’ death to tiberius tiberius took agrippina by her hand and quoted the greek line “and if you are not queen my dear have i then done you wrong”
agrippina became involved in a group of roman senators who opposed the growing power and influence of the notorious  lucius aelius  tiberius began to distrust agrippina in 26 agrippina requested tiberius to allow her to marry her brother in law roman senator gaius asinius gallus saloninus however tiberius didn’t allow her to marry saloninus because of political implications the marriage could have
tiberius caully staged to invite agrippina to dinner at the imperial palace at dinner tiberius offered agrippina an apple name salisbury2001  as a test of agrippina’s feelings for the emperor agrippina had suspected that the apple could be poisoned and used to taste the apple name salisbury2001  this was the last time that tiberius invited agrippina to his dinner table name salisbury2001  agrippina later stated that tiberius tried to poison her
in 29 agrippina and her sons  and  were arrested on the orders of tiberius tiberius falsely accused agrippina of planning to take sanctuary besides the image of augustus or with the roman army abroad agrippina and her sons were put on trial by the  she was banished on tiberius’ orders to the island of pandataria now called  in the  off the coast of  this was the island where her mother was banished
in prison at pandataria agrippina protested violently on one occasion tiberius ordered a guard to  her during the flogging agrippina would lose an eye name salisbury2001  refusing to eat agrippina was force fed but later starved herself to death name salisbury2001  tacitus however leaves open the possibility that she was deprived of nourishment while in prison and her death was not voluntary name tac1tacitus the annals   be that as it may she expired on 17 october 33 name tac1  agrippina’s son drusus died of starvation while imprisoned in rome and nero committed suicide soon after the trial name salisbury2001  the notorious guard sejanus was murdered in 31 on the orders of tiberius tiberius suspected sejanus of plotting to overthrow the emperor
after her death tiberius slandered her name and had the senate declare that her birth date was a date of bad  name salisbury2001 
in march 37 tiberius died and agrippina’s remaining son caligula succeeded as emperor after caligula delivered tiberius’ eulogy caligula sailed to pandataria and the  and returned with the ashes of his mother and brother nero caligula returned with their ashes in urns in his own hands
as proof of devotion to his family caligula arranged the most distinguished soldiers available to carry the urns of his mother and two brothers in two biers at noon in rome when the streets were at their busiest to the  a bronze medal on display in the  shows agrippina’s ashes being brought back to  by caligula
caligula had a posthumous struck of his mother agripinna the elder a sestertii bronze coin minted at rome struck under gaius caligula 37 41 ad the image with the draped bust of agrippina right wearing hair in long plait text around agrippina m f germanici caesaris a covered carriage of the carpentum on the reverse the perfection and beauty of this specific striking was a work of art created under caligula by the finest artisans of the rome 86m this  specimen of agrippina senior the elder being one of the world’s most remarkable and valuable coins front cover of women of the caesars
caligula appointed an annual day each year in rome for people to offer funeral sacrifices to honor their late relatives as a dedication to agrippina caligula set aside the circus games to honor the memory of his late mother on the day that the circus games occurred caligula had a statue made of agrippina’s image to be paraded in a covered carriage at the games
after the circus games caligula ordered written evidence of the court cases from tiberius’ treason trials to be brought to the forum to be burnt first being the cases of agrippina and her two sons
according to suetonius caligula nursed a rumor that augustus and julia the elder had an incestuous union from which agrippina the elder had been born according to tacitus agrippina’s eldest daughter  had written memoirs for posterity one memoir was an account of her mother’s life a second memoir was about the fortunes of her mother’s family and the last memoir recorded the misfortunes casus suorum of the family of agrippina and germanicus unfortunately these memoirs are now lost
agrippina is regarded in ancient and modern historical sources as a roman matron with a reputation as a great woman who had an excellent character and had outstanding roman morals she was a dedicated supporting wife and mother who looked out for the interests of her children and the future of her family
her personality and conduct did however receive a certain amount of criticism her practice of accompanying germanicus on campaigns was considered inappropriate and her tendency to take command in these situations was viewed with suspicion as subversively masculine tacitus described her as “determined and rather excitable”   agrippina knew no feminine weaknesses intolerant of rivalry thirsting for power she had a mans preoccupations throughout her life agrippina always prized her descent from augustus upbraiding tiberius for persecuting the blood of his predecessor tacitus in writing of the occasion believed this behaviour to be part of the beginning of the chain of events leading to agrippinas end
she was the first roman woman of the roman empire to have travelled with her husband to roman military campaigns to support and live with the roman legions agrippina was the first roman matron to have more than one child from her family to reign on the roman throne apart from being the late maternal grandmother of nero she was the late paternal grandmother of princess  the child of caligula through nero agrippina was the paternal great grandmother of  neros only child through his second marriage to 
from the memoirs written by agrippina the younger  used the memoirs to extract information regarding the family and fate of agrippina the elder when tacitus was writing the annals there is a surviving portrait of agrippina the elder in the  in

germanicus death caused much public grief in rome and gave rise to rumors that he had been ed by  and  on the orders of tiberius as his widow agrippina the elder returned to rome with his ashes agrippina the younger was thereafter supervised by her mother her paternal grandmother antonia minor and her great grandmother  all of them notable influential and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive she lived on the  in  her great uncle tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of augustus in 14
after her thirteenth birthday in 28 tiberius arranged for agrippina to marry her paternal second cousin  and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in tac ann 475  domitius came from a distinguished family of  through his mother  domitius was a great nephew of augustus first cousin to claudius and second cousin to agrippina and caligula he had two sisters  and  domitia lepida the younger was the mother of the empress 
antonia major was the elder sister to antonia minor and the first daughter of octavia minor and mark antony according to suetonius domitius was a wealthy man with a despicable and dishonest character who according to suetonius was a man who was in every aspect of his life detestable and served as consul in 32 agrippina and domitius lived between  modern  and paola brandizzi vittucci antium anzio e nettuno in epoca romana roma bardi 2000  and rome not much is known about the relationship between them
tiberius died on march 16 37 and agrippinas only surviving brother  became the new emperor being the emperors sister gave agrippina some influence
agrippina and her younger sisters  and  received various honors from their brother which included but were not limited to
 they were given the rights of the s like the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium
 coins were issued depicting images of caligula and his sisters roman coins like these were never issued beforehand the coins depicted caligula on one side and his sisters on the opposite
 caligula added his sisters names to motions in loyalty oaths it was i will not value my life or that of my children less highly than i do the safety of the emperor and his sisters or if in consular motions good fortune attend to the emperor and his sisters
around the time that tiberius died agrippina had become pregnant domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child in the early morning hours in antium of december 15 37 agrippina gave birth to a son agrippina and domitius named their son lucius domitius ahenobarbus after the domitius recently deceased father this child would grow up to become the emperor  nero was agrippinas only natural child suetonius states that domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son whereupon he replied i dont think anything produced by me and agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people
caligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships on june 10 38 drusilla died possibly of a fever rampant in rome at the time he was particularly fond of drusilla claiming to treat her as he would  even though drusilla had a  following her death caligula showed no special love or respect toward the surviving sisters and was said to have gone insane
in 39 agrippina and livilla with their maternal cousin drusillas widower  were involved in a failed plot to murder caligula a plot known as the plot of the three daggers which was to make lepidus the new emperor lepidus agrippina and livilla were accused of being lovers not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it at the trial of lepidus caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him
lepidus was executed agrippina and livilla were exiled by their brother to the  caligula sold their furniture jewellery slaves and freedmen in january 40  domitius died of  dropsy at pyrgi lucius had gone to live with his second paternal aunt  after caligula had taken his inheritance away from him

claudius had lucius inheritance reinstated lucius became more wealthy despite his youth shortly after  divorced lucius aunt  lucius first paternal aunt so that crispus could marry agrippina they married and crispus  became a step father to lucius crispus was a prominent influential witty wealthy and powerful man who served twice as consul he was the adopted grandson and biological great great nephew of the historian  little is known on their relationship but crispus soon died and left his estate to nero
in the first years of claudius reign claudius was married to the infamous empress  although agrippina was very influential she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor messalina was agrippinas second paternal cousin among the victims of messalinas intrigues were agrippinas surviving sister livilla who was charged with having adultery with  seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to nero
messalina considered agrippinas son a threat to her sons position and sent assassins to strangle lucius during his siesta the assassins fled in terror when they saw a snake suddenly dart from beneath lucius pillow—but it was only a sloughed off snake skin in his bed near his pillow
in 47 crispus died and at his funeral the rumor spread around that agrippina poisoned crispus to gain his estate after being widowed a second time agrippina was left very wealthy later that year at the  at the performance of the troy pageant messalina attended the event with her son britannicus agrippina was also present with lucius agrippina and lucius received greater applause from the audience than messalina and  did many people began to show pity and sympathy to agrippina due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family casus suorum and wrote an account of her mothers life
after messalina was executed in 48 for conspiring with  to overthrow her husband claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time around this time agrippina became the mistress to one of claudius advisers the former greek freedman  at that time claudius advisers were discussing which noblewoman claudius should marry claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded in more recent times it has been suggested that the senate may have pushed for the marriage between agrippina and claudius to end the feud between the julian and claudian branchesscramuzza 1940 ppampnbsp91–92 see also tac ann xii 6 7 suet claud 26  this feud dated back to agrippinas  actions against tiberius after the death of germanicus actions which tiberius had gladly punished
regardless for agrippinas seduction it was a help that she had the nieces privilege of kissing and caressing her paternal uncle claudius was seduced by her passions claudius made erences to her in his speeches my daughter and foster child born and bred in my lap so to speak when claudius decided to marry her he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest in roman society an uncle claudius marrying his niece agrippina was considered incestuous and obviously immoral
 
agrippina and claudius married on new years day 49 this marriage caused widespread disapproval this was a part of agrippinas scheming plan to make lucius the new emperor her marriage to claudius was not based on love but on power she quickly eliminated her rival  in 49 shortly after marrying claudius agrippina charged paulina with  paulina did not receive a hearing her property was confiscated  she left italy and on agrippinas orders committed suicide
in the months leading up to her marriage to claudius agrippinas maternal second cousin the   was betrothed to claudius daughter  this betrothal was broken off in 48 when agrippina scheming with the consul  the father of the future emperor  falsely accused silanus of incest with his sister  agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between octavia and her son consequently claudius broke off the engagement and forced silanus to resign from public office
silanus committed suicide on the day that agrippina married her uncle and calvina was exiled from  in early 49 calvina was called back from exile after the death of agrippina towards the end of 54 agrippina would order the murder of silanus eldest brother  without neros knowledge so that he would not seek revenge against her over his brothers death
on the day that agrippina married her uncle claudius as her third husband his fourth wife she became an empress and the most powerful woman in the  she also was a stepmother to  claudius daughter and only child from his second marriage to  and to the young  and  claudius children with valeria messalina agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court who she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late messalina she also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son one of her victims being lucius second paternal aunt and messalinas mother 
in 49 agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the  king  bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor in 50 agrippina was granted the honorific title of  a title which up until this point no other imperial woman had ever received in the lifetime of her husband she was only the third roman woman  drusilla and  received this title and only the second living roman woman the first being antonia to receive this title
also that year claudius had founded a roman colony and called the colony colonia claudia ara agrippinensis or agrippinensium today known as  after agrippina who was born there this colony was the only roman colony to be named after a roman woman in 51 she was given a carpentum which she used a carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests such as the s and sacred statues that same year she appointed  as the head of the  replacing the previous head of the praetorian guard 
ancient sources claim that agrippina successfully manipulated and influenced claudius into adopting her son and having him become his successor lucius domitius ahenobarbus in 50 was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather lucius name was changed to  claudius caesar drusus germanicus and he became claudiuss adopted son heir and recognised successor agrippina and claudius betrothed nero to octavia and agrippina arranged to have  return from exile to tutor the future emperor claudius chose to adopt nero because of his julian and claudian lineagetacitus annals xii25 
agrippina deprived britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible for instance in 51 agrippina ordered the execution of britannicus tutor sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by claudius adoption of nero and his choice of nero as successor instead of choosing his own son britannicussome compare this to when tiberius had chosen caligula and the other grandson  without any approbation  why would there be any approbation  tiberius had few descendants and gemellus was the youngest of all of them  first tiberius designated the older brothers of caligula his adopted sons sons as his successors later he accused and imprisoned them  all he had left was caligula by then over 20 and gemellus under 10  there would be more approbation for overlooking caligula in gemellus favor 
nero and octavia were married on june 9 53 claudius later repented of marrying agrippina and adopting nero began to favor britannicus and started preparing him for the throne his actions allegedly gave agrippina a motive to eliminate claudius the ancient sources say she poisoned claudius on october 13 54 with a plate of deadly s at a banquet thus enabling  to quickly take the throne as emperor accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources it is possible but exceedingly convenient that claudius died of natural causes claudius was 63 years old name   yyroia 
agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified claudius she was allowed to visit senate meetings watch and hear the meetings behind a curtain this evidently shows that she had real power
in the first months of neros reign agrippina controlled her son and the empire she lost control over nero when he began to have an affair with the freedwoman  which agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for agrippina began to support  in her attempt to make him emperor britannicus was secretly poisoned on neros orders during his own banquet in february 55 the power struggle between agrippina and her son had begun
agrippina between 55 and 58 became very watchful and had a critical eye over her son in 55 agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers and even removed her roman and german bodyguards nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the greek island of  a place where  had lived after divorcing  pallas also was dismissed from the court the fall of pallas and the opposition of burrus and seneca contributed to agrippinas loss of authority name powersimon hornblower antony spawforth – ea edd    2003 
towards 57 agrippina was expelled from the palace and went to live in a riverside estate in  while agrippina lived there or when she went on short visits to rome nero had sent people to annoy her although living in misenum she was still very popular powerful and influential agrippina and nero would see each other on short visits
the circumstances that surround agrippinas death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti nero bias all surviving stories of agrippinas death contradict themselves and each other and are generally fantastical
 
according to  in 58 nero became involved with the noble woman  with the reasoning that a divorce from octavia and a marriage to poppaea was not politically feasible with agrippina alive nero decided to kill agrippinatacitus annals xiv1  yet nero did not marry poppaea until 62 calling into question this motivesee dawson alexis whatever happened to lady agrippina the classical quarterly 1969 p 264   additionally  reveals that poppaeas husband  was not sent away by nero until after agrippinas death in 59 making it highly unlikely that already married poppaea would be pressing nerosuetonius the lives of caesars life of otho 3  some modern historians theorize that neros decision to kill agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set gaius  neros maternal second cousin or  claudius biological son on the thronerogers robert heirs and rivals to nero transactions and proceedings of the american philological association vol 86 1955 p 202 silana accuses agrippina of plotting to bring up plautus in 55 tacitus annals xiii19 silana is recalled from exile after agrippinas power waned tacitus annals xiv12 plautus is exiled in 60 tacitus annals xiv22 
tacitus claims that nero considered poisoning or stabbing her but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious so he settled on   after the advice of his former tutor    building a self sinking boattacitus annals xiv3  though aware of the plot agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a sofa breaking the ceilings fall name   lpygletacitus annals xiv5  though the collapsing ceiling missed agrippina it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm name   lpygle 
the boat failed to sink from the lead ceiling so the crew then sank the boat but agrippina swam to shore name   lpygle  her friend  was attacked by oarsmen while still in the water and was either bludgeoned to death or drowned since she was exclaiming that she was agrippina with the intention of being saved she did not know however that this was an assassination attempt not a mere accident agrippina was met at the shore by crowds of admirers name   eezojstacitus annals xiv8  news of agrippinas survival reached nero so he sent three assassins to kill her name   eezojs 
 
according to  nero was annoyed at his mother being too watchful and tried three times to poison agrippina but she took the antidotes in time and survived name   wtjprbsuetonius the lives of caesars life of nero 34  he then tried to crush her with a mechanical ceiling over her bed at her residence name   wtjprb  after this failed he devised a collapsable boat which would either have its cabin fall in or become shipwrecked  nero then ordered captains of a different boat to ram this boat while agrippina was aboard name   wtjprb   nero heard agrippina survived the wreck so he ordered her to be executed and framed it as a suicide name   wtjprb

after agrippinas death nero viewed her corpse and commented how beautiful she was according to sometacitus annals xiv9  her body was cremated that night on a dining couch at his mothers funeral nero was witless speechless and rather scared when the news spread that agrippina had died the roman army senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had been saved from his mothers plots
 
during the remainder of neros reign agrippinas grave was not covered or enclosed her household later on gave her a modest tomb in  nero would have his mothers death on his conscience he felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares about his mother he even saw his mothers ghost and got n magicians to scare her away years before she died agrippina had visited s to ask about her sons future the astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her she replied let him kill me provided he becomes emperor according to

this collapse of rain fed agriculture in the upper country meant the loss to southern mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the akkadian empire solvent  water levels within the tigris and euphrates fell 15 metres beneath the level of 2600 bc and although they stabilised for a time during the following ur iii period rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands such as the building of a  wall known as the repeller of the amorites between the tigris and euphrates under the ur iii ruler  such attempts led to increased political instability meanwhile severe depression occurred to re establish  with the less favorable climatic conditionschristie peter 2008 the curse of akkad climate upheavals that rocked human history paperbackannick press pp 31 48

the akkadian government formed a classical standard with which all future mesopotamian states compared themselves traditionally the ensi was the highest functionary of the sumerian s in later traditions one became an ensi by marrying the goddess inanna legitimising the rulership through divine consent
initially the monarchical lugal lu   man gal   great was subordinate to the priestly ensi and was appointed at times of troubles but by later dynastic times it was the lugal who had emerged as the preeminent role having his own é   house or palace independent from the temple establishment by the time of  whichever dynasty controlled the city of kish was recognised as šar kiššati   king of kish and was considered preeminent in sumer possibly because this was where the two rivers approached and whoever controlled kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream
as sargon extended his conquest from the lower sea persian gulf to the upper sea mediterranean it was felt that he ruled the totality of the lands under heaven or from sunrise to sunset as contemporary texts put it under sargon the ensis generally retained their positions but were seen more as provincial governors the title šar kiššati became recognised as meaning lord of the universe sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to   and magan amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history  whether he also did in the case of the mediterranean with the kingdom of  possibly  as claimed in later documents is more questionable
with naram sin sargons grandson this went further than with sargon with the king not only being called lord of the four quarters of the earth but also elevated to the ranks of the dingir   gods with his own temple establishment previously a ruler could like  become divine after death but the akkadian kings from naram sin onward were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainersleick gwendolyn 2001 mesopotamia invention of the city penguin books 
one strategy adopted by both sargon and naram sin to maintain control of the country was to install their daughters enheduanna and emmenanna respectively as high priestess to sin the akkadian version of the sumerian moon deity nanna at ur in the extreme south of sumer to install sons as provincial ensi governors in strategic locations and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the empire  and marhashe a well documented case of the latter is that of naram sins daughter taram agade at urkeshhttp  128976202 attach buccellati%202002%20taram%20agade%20daughter%20of%20naram%20sinpdf taram agade daughter of naram sin at urkesh buccellati giorgio and marilyn kelly buccellati in of pots and plans papers on the archaeology and history of mesopotamia and syria presented to david oates in honour of his 75th birthday london nabu publications 2002 
the population of akkad like nearly all pre modern states was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region which seem to have had two principal centres the irrigated farmlands of southern iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain fed agriculture of northern iraq known as the upper country
southern iraq during akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than  per year with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation before the akkadian period the progressive  of the soils produced by poorly drained irrigation had been reducing yields of  in the southern part of the country leading to the conversion to more salt tolerant  growing urban populations there had peaked already by 2600 bc and illogical pressures were high contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the akkadian period as seen in the  of  warfare between city states had led to a population decline from which akkad provided a temporary respitethompson william j 2003 complexity diminishing marginal returns and serial mesopotamian fragmentation journal of world systems research  it was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time giving akkad its military advantage
the  in this region was very high and replenished regularly—by winter storms in the headwaters of the tigris and euphrates from october to march and from snow melt from march to july flood levels that had been stable from about 3000 to 2600 bc had started falling and by the akkadian period were a half meter to a meter lower than recorded previously even so the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the nile serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from august to october—a period of food shortage—under the control of city temple authorities thus acting as a form of unemployment relief some have suggested that this was sargons original employment for the king of kish giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men a tablet reads sargon the king to whom enlil permitted no rival—5400 warriors ate bread daily before himkramer 1963324 quoted in charles keith maisels the emergence of civilization ch the institutions of urbanism 1990179 
harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months nomadic amorites from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals for this privilege they would have to pay a tax in wool meat milk and cheese to the temples who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood in good years all would go well but in bad years wild winter pastures would be in short supply nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields and conflicts with farmers would result it would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the empire temporarily overcame this problem  and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region
as a result sumer and akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else particularly metal ores timber and building stone all of which had to be imported the spread of the akkadian state as far as the silver mountain possibly the  the cedars of lebanon and the copper deposits of magan was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports one tablet reads sargon the king of kish triumphed in thirty four battles over the cities up to the edge of the sea and destroyed their walls he made the ships from meluhha the ships from magan and the ships from dilmun tie up alongside the quay of agade sargon the king prostrated himself before the god dagan and made supplication to him and he dagan gave him the upper land namely mari yarmuti and ebla up to the cedar forest and up to the silver mountain

during the 3rd millennium bc there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the sumerians and the akkadians which included widespread  name deutscher  the influence of sumerian on  and vice versa is evident in all areas from lexical borrowing on a massive scale to syntactic morphological and phonological convergence name deutscher  this has prompted scholars to er to sumerian and akkadian in the third millennium as a  name deutscher  akkadian gradually replaced sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium bc the exact dating being a matter of debate name woods  but sumerian continued to be used as a sacred ceremonial literary and scientific language in mesopotamia until the 1st century ad name britanica 
sumerian literature continued in rich development during the akkadian period a notable example being enheduanna  the wife sumerian dam   high priestess of  the sumerian moon god and daughter of sargonwinter irene j 1987 women in public the disk of enheduanna the beginning of the office of en priestess the weight of the visual evidence la femme dans le proche orient antique paris editions recherche sur les civilisations  of the temple of sin at ur who lived ca 2285–2250 bc is the first poet in history whom we know by name her known works include hymns to the goddess inanna the exaltation of inanna and in nin sa gur ra a third work the temple hymns a collection of specific hymns addresses the sacred temples and their occupants the deity to whom they were consecrated the works of this poetess are significant because although they start out using the third person they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform as poetess princess and priestess she was a personality who according to william w hallo set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuriesenheduanna the exaltation of inanna translated by william w hallo and jja van dijk

enheduanna depicts inanna as disciplining mankind as a goddess of battle she thereby unites the warlike akkadian ishtars qualities to those of the gentler sumerian goddess of love and fecundity she likens inanna to a great storm bird who swoops down on the lesser gods and sends them fluttering off like surprised bats then in probably the most interesting part of the hymn enheduanna herself steps forward in the first person to recite her own past glories establishing her credibility and explaining her present plight she has been banished as high priestess from the temple in the city of ur and from uruk and exiled to the steppe she begs the moon god nanna to intercede for her because the city of uruk under the ruler lugalanne has rebelled against sargon the rebel lugalanne has even destroyed the temple eanna one of the greatest temples in the ancient world and then made advances on his sister in lawbinkley roberta the importance of enheduanna

ajax or aias  or   was a  the son of king  and  and the half brother of http  wwwsalaminagr english indexhtm salamis the island salamis the island    salamina municipality   greek island  he plays an important role in s  and in the  a series of  about the  to distinguish him from ajax son of oileus  he is called telamonian ajax greater ajax or ajax the great  in  he is known as aivas tlamunus
ajax is the son of telamon who was the son of  and grandson of  and his first wife periboea he is the cousin of  and is the elder  of  many illustrious  including    and the historian  traced their descent from ajax the italian scholar maggiani recently showed that on an etruscan tomb dedicated to racvi satlnei in bologna 5th century bc there is a writing that says aivastelmunsl   family of ajax télamon
in homers iliad he is described as of great stature colossal frame and strongest of all the  known as the bulwark of the achaeanshomer iliad http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textdoc hom+il+65 65  he was trained by the   who had trained ajax father telamon and achilles father  and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by  whom he was at the time training at the same time as achilles he was described as fearless strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow hides with a layer of bronze most notably ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the iliad and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles although in book 13 poseidon strikes ajax with his staff renewing his strength
in the iliad ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage seen particularly in two fights with  in book 7 ajax is chosen by lot to meet hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day ajax at first gets the better of the encounter wounding hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone 7268272  but hector fights on until the s acting at the direction of zeus call a draw the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts ajax giving hector a purple sash and hector giving ajax his sharp sword
the second fight between ajax and hector occurs when the latter breaks into the mycenaean camp and fights with the greeks among the ships in book 14 ajax throws a giant rock at hector which almost kills him 14408417  in book 15 hector is restored to his strength by  and returns to attack the ships ajax wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship holds off the  armies virtually single handedly in book 16 hector and ajax duel once again  hector is set on burning the ships the only way he feels the greeks will truly be defeated hector is able to disarm ajax although ajax is not hurt and ajax is forced to retreat seeing that zeus is clearly favoring hector hector and the trojans succeed in burning one greek ship the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war ajax is responsible for the death of many trojans lords including 
ajax often fought in tandem with his brother teucer known for his skill with the bow  ajax would wield his magnificent shield as teucer stood behind picking off enemy trojans
achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with agamemnon in book 9 agamemnon and the other mycenaean chiefs send ajax  and  to the tent of achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight although ajax speaks earnestly and is well received he does not succeed in convincing achilles
when  is killed hector tries to steal his body ajax assisted by  succeeds in fighting off the trojans and taking the body back with his chariot however the trojans had already stripped patroclus of achilles armor ajaxs prayer to zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial  according to  in total ajax killed 28 people at troyhyginus  http  wwwtheoicom text hyginusfabulae3html 114 
 
like most of the other greek leaders ajax is alive and well as the iliad comes to a close when achilles dies killed by  with help from apollo ajax and odysseus are the heroes who fight against the trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion patroclushomer odyssey http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textdoc hom+od+242  ajax with his great shield and spear manages to drive off the trojans while odysseus pulls the body to his chariot and rides away with it to safety after the burial each claims achilles magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts after several days of competition odysseus and ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor which had been forged on  by the smith god  it is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the greeks including saving the ships from hector and driving him off with a massive rock he deserves the armorovid metamorphoses translated by rolfe humphries indianapolis indiana university 1955 book xiii pp 305 309   however odysseus proves to be more eloquent and the council gives him the armor ajax unconquered and furious falls upon his own sword conquered by his own sorrowmetamorphoses trans humphries pampnbsp318   
the  a marble torso now in the vatican museums is considered to depict ajax in the act of contemplating his suicide 
in sophocles play  a famous retelling of ajaxs demise after the armor is awarded to odysseus ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill agamemnon and menelaus athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them imagining they are the achaean leaders including odysseus and agamemnon when he comes to his senses covered in blood he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor and decides that he pers to kill himself rather than live in shame he does so with the same sword which hector gave him when they exchanged presents 7303  from his blood sprang a red flower as at the death of  which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name ai also expressive of lament 1354  his ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the  promontory at the entrance of the 
ajaxs half brother teucer stood trial before his father for not bringing ajaxs body or weapons back teucer was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence he was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home the island of salamis off the coast of athens
homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of ajaxs death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over achilles armor when odysseus visits  he begs the soul of ajax to speak to him but ajax still resentful over the old quarrel uses and descends silently back into 
like achilles he is represented although not by homer as living after his death on the  at the mouth of the  http  wwwtheoicom text pausanias3bhtml description of greece iii 19 § 13  ajax who in the post homeric legend is described as the grandson of aeacus and the great grandson of zeus was the  of the island of salamis where he had a temple and an image and where a festival called aianteia was celebrated in his honourpausanias 135  at this festival a couch was set up on which the  of the hero was placed a practice which recalls the roman  the identification of ajax with the family of aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the athenians after salamis had come into their possession on which occasion  is said to have inserted a line in the  2557–558  http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textjsessionid 0ae5cea2e5e28fe965ff802c44870114doc hom+il+2557 2557258  for the purpose of supporting the athenian claim to the island ajax then became an  hero he was worshiped at athens where he had a statue in the market place and the tribe aiantis was named after him pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton its kneecap  in diameter appeared on the beach near  on the trojan coast these bones were identified as those of ajax
there is  that ajax founded the city of  in the mediterranean island of  now part of france and gave it his name
in 2001 yannos lolos began excavating a  palace on the island of salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological aiacid dynasty  the ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of kanakia of salamis a few miles off the coast of athens the multi story structure covers  and had perhaps 30 rooms the trojan war is supposed by many  to have occurred at the height of the mycenaean civilization see discussion of  roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned

alaric i    supreme chief b 370 or 375 – d 410 was the first  of the  from 395–410 son or paternal grandson of chieftain   alaric is best known for his  in 410 which marked a decisive event in the 
alaric began his career under the gothic soldier  and later joined the roman army  alarics first appearance was as the leader of a mixed band of  and allied peoples who invaded  in 391 and were stopped by the half  roman general  in 394 he led a gothic force of 20000 that helped the   defeat the  usurper  at the  despite sacrificing around 10000 of his men alaric received little recognition from the emperor disappointed he left the army and was elected  of the  in 395 and marched toward  until he was diverted by roman forces he then moved southward into  where he sacked  the port of  and destroyed    and  as a response the eastern emperor  appointed alaric  master of the soldiers in 
in 401 alaric invaded italy but he was defeated by  at  modern pollenza on april6 402 a second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the  though alaric forced the  to pay a large subsidy to the visigoths during  italian invasion in 406 alaric remained idle in  in 408   ordered the execution of stilicho and his family amid rumours that the general had made a deal with alaric honorius then incited the roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of  goths serving in the roman military subsequently around 30000 gothic soldiers defected to alaric and joined his march on rome to avenge their murdered families name heather 
moving swiftly along s alaric sacked the cities of  and  and ravaged the lands along the  the visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to rome in 408 eventually the senate granted him a substantial subsidy in addition alaric forced the senate to liberate all 40000  slaves in rome honorius however used to appoint alaric as the commander of the western roman army and in 409 the visigoths again surrounded rome alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming  as  attalus appointed him  master of both services but used to allow him to send an army into  negotiations with honorius broke down and alaric deposed attalus in the summer of 410 and besieged rome for the third time allies within the capital opened the gates for him on august24 and for three days his troops  although the visigoths plundered rome they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings having abandoned a plan to occupy  and  after the destruction of his fleet in a storm alaric died as the visigoths were marching northward
born on  at the mouth of the  in present day  alaric belonged to the noble  of the   the goths suffered setbacks against the  made a mass migration across the  and fought a  alaric was probably a child during this period
during the fourth century the  commonly employed   under roman command but organized by tribal structures to spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money emperors began to employ units recruited from germanic tribes  the largest of these contingents was that of the goths who in 382 376 in some sources had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries keeping a large degree of autonomy
in 394 alaric served as a leader of foederati under  in the campaign which crushed the usurper  as the  which terminated this campaign was fought at the passes of the  alaric probably learned the weakness of  natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the 
theodosius died in 395 leaving the empire to be divided between his two sons  and  the former taking  and the latter  of the empire arcadius showed little interest in ruling leaving most of the actual power to his   honorius was still a minor as his guardian theodosius had appointed the   stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of arcadius causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts
according to  in  during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies he was denied the promotion however among the visigoths settled in lower  now part of bulgaria and romania the situation was ripe for rebellion they had suffered disproportionately great losses at frigidus according to rumour exposing the visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the gothic tribes this combined with their post battle rewards prompted them to raise alaric on a shield and proclaim him king according to  a 6th century roman bureaucrat of gothic origin who later turned his hand to history both the new king and his people decided rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others
alaric struck first at the eastern empire he marched to the neighborhood of  but finding himself unable to undertake a siege retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through  and the unguarded pass of  into 
the armies of the eastern empire were occupied with  incursions in  and  instead rufinus attempted to negotiate with alaric in person which only aroused suspicions in constantinople that rufinius was in league with the goths stilicho now marched east against alaric according to  stilicho was in a position to destroy the goths when he was ordered by arcadius to leave  soon after rufinus own soldiers hacked him to death power in constantinople now passed to the eunuch chamberlain 
rufinus death and stilichos departure gave free rein to alarics movements he ravaged  but spared  which capitulated at once to the conqueror in 396 he wiped out the last remnants of the  in attica ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the  then he penetrated into the  and captured its most famous cities—  and —selling many of their inhabitants into slavery
here however his victorious career suffered a serious setback in 397 stilicho crossed the sea to greece and succeeded in trapping the goths in the mountains of  on the borders of  and  in the peninsula from there alaric escaped with difficulty and not without some suspicion of connivance by stilicho who supposedly had again received orders to depart alaric then crossed the  and marched with the plunder of  northward to  here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him magister militum per illyricum giving him the roman command he had desired as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals
it was probably in 401 that alaric made his first invasion of italy originally with the intention to petition for a position closer to rome alaric had a fascination for the golden age of rome and insisted on his tribesmen calling him alaricus   supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise some lines of the roman poet  inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a  break off all delays alaric this very year thou shalt force the alpine barrier of italy thou shalt penetrate to the city but the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time after spreading desolation through north  and striking terror into the citizens of rome alaric was met by  at  today in  the battle which followed on april 6 402 coinciding with easter was a victory for rome though a costly one but it effectively halted the goths progress
stilichos enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great christian festival alaric too was outwardly a christian though an  not  though he continued to practice the pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing christian ritual practices he had trusted to the sanctity of easter for immunity from attack
alarics wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children which gave his invasion of italy the character of a 
after another defeat before  alaric left italy probably in 403 he had not penetrated to the city but his invasion of italy had produced important results it caused the imperial residence to be transferred from  to  and necessitated the withdrawal of  from britain
alaric became the friend and ally of his erstwhile opponent  by 407 the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war stilicho actually proposed using alarics troops to enforce honorius claim to the  of illyricum the death of arcadius in may 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court but alaric who had actually entered epirus demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the expenses of  the sum which he named was a large one 4000ampnbsppounds of gold under strong pressure from stilicho the roman senate consented to promise its payment
but three months later stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on honorius orders in the unrest that followed throughout italy the wives and children of the foederati were slain name heather  consequently these 30000 men flocked to alarics camp clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies he accordingly led them across the julian alps and in september 408 stood before the walls of  now with no capable general like stilicho as a defender and began a strict blockade
no blood was shed this time alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon when the ambassadors of the  entreating for peace tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish he laughed and gave his celebrated answer the thicker the hay the easier mowed after much bargaining the famine stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5000 pounds of gold 30000 pounds of silver 4000 silken tunics 3000 hides dyed scarlet and 3000 pounds of pepper name norj norwich byzantium the early centuries 134  along came 40000 freed  slaves thus ended alarics first siege of rome
throughout his career alarics primary goal was not to undermine the empire but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the empires borders his demands were certainly grand the concession of a block of territory 200ampnbspmiles long by 150 wide between the  and the gulf of  to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the empire and the title of commander in chief of the imperial army immense as his terms were the emperor would have been well advised to grant them honorius however used to see beyond his own safety guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of  as all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed alaric after instituting a second siege and blockade of  in 409 came to terms with the senate with their consent he set up a rival emperor the pect of the city a greek named 
alaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with honorius these negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another goth  an  and theore hereditary enemy of alaric and his house alaric again outwitted by an enemys machinations marched southward and in deadly earnest began his third siege of rome apparently defence was impossible there are hints not well substantiated of treachery surprise is a more likely explanation however this may be—for our information at this point of the story is meagre—on august 24 410 alaric and his visigoths burst in by the  on the northeast of the city rome for so long victorious against its enemies was now at the mercy of its foreign conquerors
the contemporary  recorded with wonder many instances of the visigoths clemency christian churches saved from ravage protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and christians who took uge therein vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling spared because they belonged to st peter at least one case in which a beautiful roman matron appealed not in vain to the better feelings of the gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor but even these exceptional instances show that rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city nonetheless the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire save the  which were situated close to the gate by which the goths had made their entrance nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to alaric and his followers the  in the  did burn down which perhaps can be attributed to alaric the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor the pagan emperors tombs of the  and  were rifled and the ashes scattered
alaric having penetrated the city marched southwards into  he desired to invade africa which thanks to its grain had become the key to holding italy but a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned alaric died soon after in  probably of fevererik durschmied from armageddon to the fall of rome p 401 ch 17 2002 london coronet  and his body was according to legend buried under the riverbed of the  in accordance with the pagan practices of the visigothic people the stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug wherein the gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred when the work was finished the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret
alaric was succeeded in the command of the gothic army by his brother in law  who married honorius sister  three years later

albertus magnus  before 1200 – november 15 1280 also known as albert the great and albert of cologne is a catholic saint he was a german dominican  and a  he was known during his lifetime as doctor universalis and doctor expertus and late in his life the term magnus was appended to his name  scholars such as james a weisheipl and joachim r söder have erred to him as the greatest german philosopher and theologian of the joachim r söder albert der grosse – ein staunen  erregendes wunder wort und antwort 41 2000 145 ja weisheipl albertus magnus joseph strayer ed dictionary of the middle ages 1 new york scribner 1982 129  the  honours him as a  one of only 36 so honoured
it seems likely that albert was born sometime before 1200 given well attested evidence that he was aged over 80 on his death in 1280 more than one source says that albert was 87 on his death which has led 1193 to be commonly given as the date of alberts birth name 0   albert was probably born in  now in  since he called himself albert of lauingen but this might simply be a family name most probably his family was of ministerial class his familiar connection with being son of the count bollstädt noble family was a 15th century misinterpretation what is now completely disproved name 0tugwell simon albert and thomas new york paulist press 1988 p 3 96–7 
albert was probably educated principally at the  where he received instruction in s writings a late account by rudolph de novamagia ers to albertus encounter with the  who convinced him to enter  in 1223 or 1229 he became a member of the  and studied  at  and elsewhere selected to fill the position of lecturer at cologne germany where the dominicans had a house he taught for several years there and at    and  during his first tenure as lecturer at cologne albert wrote his summa de bono after discussion with  concerning the transcendental properties of being name kovach francs 1980 pxkovach francs and rober shahan albert the great commemorative essays  norman oklahoma university of oklahoma press 1980 px  in 1245 albert became master of theology under gueric of saint quentin the first german dominican to achieve this distinction following this turn of events albert was able to teach theology at the  as a full time professor holding the seat of the chair of theology at the college of st james name kovach francs 1980 px hampden the life p 33  during this time  began to study under albertus name kennedyhttp  wwwnewadventorg cathen 01264ahtm kennedy daniel st albertus magnus the catholic encyclopedia vol 1 new york robert appleton company 1907 10 sept 2014 
albert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of  thus making them accessible to wider academic debate the study of  brought him to study and comment on the teachings of muslim academics notably  and  and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate
in 1254 albert was made  of the dominican order name kennedy  and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency during his tenure he publicly defended the dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the university of paris commented on  and answered what he perceived as errors of the  averroes
in 1259 albert took part in the general chapter of the dominicans at  together with thomas aquinas masters bonushomo britto  florentiusprobably florentius de hidinio aka florentius gallicus http  booksgooglecom booksid liynaaaaqaajamppg pa103#v onepageampqampf false histoire literaire de la france xiiie siècle volume 19 p 104 accessed october 27 2012  and peter later  establishing a ratio studiorum or program of studies for the dominicanshttp  booksgooglecom booksid pf4haaaayaajamppg pa701#v onepageampqampf false encyclopaedia of religion and ethics volume 10 p 701 accessed 9 june 2011  that featured the study of philosophy as an innovation for those not sufficiently trained to study theology this innovation initiated the tradition of dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice for example in 1265 at the orders studium provinciale at the convent of  in rome out of which would develop the  the angelicumhttp  wwwdomcentralorg study opstudyhtm weisheipl op j a the place of study in the ideal of st dominic 1960  accessed 19 march 2013

after suffering a collapse of health in 1278 he died on november 15 1280 in the dominican convent in cologne  since november 15 1954 his relics are in a roman sarcophagus in the  of the dominican st  church in cologne  although his body was discovered to be incorrupt at the first exhumation three years after his death at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained name cruz 1977 
albert was  in 1622 he was  and proclaimed a doctor of the church on december 16 1931 by  name markus  and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941 st alberts  is november 15
alberts writings collected in 1899 went to thirty eight volumes these displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as  theology             and  he digested interpreted and systematized the whole of aristotles works gleaned from the latin translations and notes of the arabian commentators in accordance with church doctrine most modern knowledge of aristotle was preserved and presented by albert name kennedy 
his principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the books of the sentences of  magister sententiarum and the summa theologiae in two volumes the latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former
alberts activity however was more philosophical than theological see  the philosophical works occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes are generally divided according to the  scheme of the sciences and consist of interpretations and condensations of aristotles relative works with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master albert believed that aristotles approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a christian philosophical view of the natural order name markus 
alberts knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate his industry in every department was great and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy his protracted study of aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition an exception to this general tendency is his latin treatise de falconibus later inserted in the larger work de animalibus as book 23 chapter 40 in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a the differences between the  and the other kinds of birds b the different kinds of s c the way of preparing them for the  and d the cures for sick and wounded falconsan smets le réception en langue vulgaire du de falconibus dalbert le grand in medieval forms of argument disputation and debate ed georgiana donavin carol poster and richard utz eugene or wipf amp stock 2002 pp 189–99  his scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries bestowing upon him the honourable surname doctor universalis
in de mineralibus albert claims the aim of natural philosophy science is not to simply to accept the statements of others but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature aristotelianism greatly influences alberts view on nature and philosophy name kennedy  another example of his reason to formally search for the causes is in his treatises on plants he begins with the principle experiment is the only safe guide in such investigations his studies of aristotle and theology show their colors in nearly all of his works and volumes
albert placed emphasis on experiment as well as investigation but he respected authority and tradition so much that many of his investigations or experiments were unpublished albert would often keep silent about many issues such as astronomy physics and such because he felt that his theories were too advanced for the time in which he was living name kennedy 
in the centuries since his death many stories arose about albert as an  and magician much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works particularly the alchemical work known as the secreta alberti or the experimenta alberti were falsely attributed to albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through associationkatz david a an illustrated history of alchemy and early chemistry 1978  on the subject of alchemy and chemistry many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject and then mostly through commentary on aristotle for example in his commentary de mineralibus he ers to the power of stones but does not elaborate on what these powers might begeorg wieland albert der grosse  der entwurf einer eigenständigen philosophie philosophen des mittelalters darmstadt primus 2000 124 39  a wide range of pseudo albertine works dealing with alchemy exist though showing the belief developed in the generations following alberts death that he had mastered alchemy one of the fundamental sciences of the middle ages these include metals and materials the secrets of chemistry the origin of metals the origins of compounds and a concordance which is a collection of observations on the  and other alchemy chemistry topics collected under the name of theatrum chemicumwalsh john the thirteenth greatest of centuries 190746http  booksgooglecom booksid _rofaaaaiaajamppg ra2 pa46ampdq albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#pra2 pa46m1 available online  he is credited with the discovery of the element  name buildingblocks451 3  and experimented with photosensitive chemicals including    he did believe that stones had occult properties as he related in his work de mineralibus however there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments
according to legend albert is said to have discovered the philosophers stone and passed it to his pupil thomas aquinas shortly before his death albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by transmutationjulian franklyn and frederick e budd a survey of the occult electric book company 2001 p 28 30 isbn 1 84327 087 0  given that thomas aquinas died six years before alberts death this legend as stated is unlikely
in his little book of alchemy albert said that alchemic gold and iron lack the properties of natural gold and iron alchemical iron not being magnetic and alchemical gold turning to powder after several ignitions
albert was deeply interested in astrology as has been articulated by scholars such as paola zambellipaola zambelli the speculum astronomiae and its enigma dordrecht  throughout the middle agesampnbsp–and well into the early modern periodampnbsp–astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm the latter being the cosmos itself it was believed that correspondence theore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth with this worldview it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being albert made this a central component of his philosophical system arguing that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with christian preceptsscott e hendrix how albert the greats speculum astronomiae was interpreted and used by four centuries of readers lewiston 2010 44 46  the most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260 now known as the  however details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote from his early de natura boni to his last work the summa theologiaehendrix 195 
albert believed that all natural things were composed of composition of matter and form he erred to it as quod est and quo est albert also believed that god alone is the absolute ruling entity alberts version of  is very similar to the  doctrine but he also took some concepts from avicennakovach francs and rober shahan albert the great commemorative essays  norman oklahoma university of oklahoma press 1980 p 133 135  liber phisicorum sive auditus phisici is an eight book commentary which albert wrote in france before 1349 on aristotle’s physics name upenn 
albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on aristotles poetics he rejected the idea of  as ridiculous movement of astronomical bodies he supposed is incapable of generating sound he wrote extensively on proportions in music and on the three different subjective levels on which  could work on the human soul purging of the impure illumination leading to contemplation and nourishing perfection through contemplation of particular interest to 20th century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music
both of his early treatises de natura boni and de bono start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good albert ers to the physical good as bonum naturae albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics in alberts later works he says in order to understand human or moral goodness the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds this procedure lects alberts preoccupations with neo platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of pseudo dionysiuscunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p 93  alberts view was highly valued by the catholic church and his peers
albert devoted the last tractatus of de bono to a theory of justice and  albert places god as the pinnacle of justice and natural law god legislates and divine authority is supreme up until his time it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosophercunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p207 
albert mentions friendship in his work de bono as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of tractatus ii later in his life he published super ethicacunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p242  with his development of friendship throughout his work this is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on albert comments on aristotles view of friendship with a quote from  who writes friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human with goodwill and love albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreementcunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p243  albert calls this harmony consensiom itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit albert fully agrees with aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness albert describes several levels of goodness the useful utile the pleasurable delectabile and the authentic or unqualified good honestum then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels friendship based on usefulness amicitia utilis friendship based on pleasure amicitia delectabilis and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness amicitia honesti amicitia quae fundatur super honestumcunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p244

alboin 530s – june 28 572 was king of the  from about 560 until 572 during his reign the lombards ended their  by settling in italy the northern part of which alboin conquered between 569 and 572 he had a lasting effect on italy and the  in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of lombard rule and in the latter his defeat of the  and his departure from  ended the dominance there of the 
the period of alboins reign as king in pannonia following the death of his father  was one of confrontation and conflict between the lombards and their main neighbors the gepids the gepids initially gained the upper hand but in 567 thanks to his alliance with the  alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies whose lands the avars subsequently occupied the increasing power of his new neighbours caused alboin some unease however and he theore decided to leave pannonia for italy hoping to take advantage of the s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the 
after gathering a large coalition of peoples alboin crossed the  in 568 entering an almost undefended italy he rapidly took control of most of  and  in 569 unopposed he took northern italys main city   offered stiff resistance however and was only taken after a siege lasting three years during that time alboin turned his attention to  but signs of factionalism among his supporters and alboins diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves
alboin was assassinated on june 28 572 in a  instigated by the byzantines it was organized by the kings foster brother  with the support of alboins wife  daughter of the gepid king whom alboin had killed some years earlier the coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the lombards who elected  as alboins successor forcing helmichis and rosamund to flee to  under imperial protection alboins death deprived the lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn germanic entity together the last in the line of hero kings who had led the lombards through their migrations from the vale of the  to italy for many centuries following his death alboins heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in saxon and bavarian epic poetry
the lombards under king  had migrated towards the east into pannonia taking advantage of the difficulties facing the  in italy following the death of its founder  in 526 wachos death in about 540 brought his son  to the throne but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by alboins father audoin of the  clan seven years later walthari died giving audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning jarnut 1995 pp 16–18 
alboin was probably born in the 530s in pannonia name plre3martindale 1992 sv alboin pp 38–40  the son of audoin and his wife  she may have been the niece of king theodoric and betrothed to audoin through the mediation of emperor rovagnati 2003 pp 28–29 amory 2003 p 462  like his father alboin was raised a pagan although audoin had at one point attempted to gain byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a christianwickham 1989 pp 29–30  alboin took as his first wife the christian  daughter of the  king  this marriage which took place soon after the death of the frankish ruler  in 555 is thought to lect audoins decision to distance himself from the byzantines traditional allies of the lombards who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting audoin against the gepids the new frankish alliance was important because of the franks known hostility to the byzantine empire providing the lombards with more than one optionjarnut 1995 p 21  name dbibertolini 1960 pp 34–38  however the  interprets events and sources differently believing that alboin married chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561 the year of chlothars death name plre3 
alboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in a clash with the gepids at the  552 he killed  son of the gepid king  in a victory that resulted in the emperor justinians intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powersrovagnati 2003 p 28  after the battle according to a tradition reported by  to be granted the right to sit at his fathers table alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons as was customary for this initiation he went to the court of thurisind where the gepid king gave him turismods arms name plre3 ausenda 1999 p 433   believes it is probable that in this narrative paul was making use of an oral tradition and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical  of an goffart 1988 p 387 
alboin came to the throne after the death of his father sometime between 560 and 565 name dbi  as was customary among the lombards alboin took the crown after an election by the tribes freemen who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereigns clanjarnut 1995 p 25 wolfram 1997 p 284  shortly afterwards in 565 a new war erupted with the gepids now led by  thurisinds son the cause of the conflict is uncertain as the sources are divided the lombard paul the deacon accuses the gepids while the byzantine historian  places the blame on alboin an interpretation favoured by historian  name pohl96pohl 1997 p 96 
an account of the war by the byzantine  sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict claiming it originated with alboins vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of cunimunds daughter  that alboin proceeded then to marry the tale is treated with scepticism by walter goffart who observes that it conflicts with the  where she was captured only after the death of her father name wg392 martindale 1992 sv cunimundus p 364  the gepids obtained the support of the emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of  the seat of the gepid kings thus in 565 or 566 justinians successor  sent his son in law  as  field commander to lead a byzantine army against alboin in support of cunimund ending in the lombards complete defeat name dbi  name pohl96 rovagnati 2003 p 30  name jj22jarnut 1995 p 22 martindale 1992 sv baduarius 2 pp 64–65 
faced with the possibility of annihilation alboin made an alliance in 566 with the  under  at the expense of some tough conditions the avars demanded a tenth of the lombards cattle half of the war booty and on the wars conclusion all of the lands held by the gepids the lombards played on the pre existing hostility between the avars and the byzantines claiming that the latter were allied with the gepids cunimund on the other hand encountered hostility when he once again asked the emperor for military assistance as the byzantines had been angered by the gepids failure to cede sirmium to them as had been agreed moreover justin ii was moving away from the foreign policy of justinian and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples attempts to mollify justin ii with tributes failed and as a result the byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the avars name dbi pohl 1997 pp 96–97 
in 567 the allies made their final move against cunimund with alboin invading the gepids lands from the northwest while bayan attacked from the northeast cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the lombards and clashing with alboin somewhere between the  and  rivers the gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle their king slain by alboin and cunimunds daughter rosamund taken captive according to erences in the origo the full destruction of the gepid kingdom was completed by the avars who overcame the gepids in the east as a result the gepids ceased to exist as an independent people and were partly absorbed by the lombards and the avars name dbi  name jj22 rovagnati 2003 pp 30–31  some time before 568 alboins first wife chlothsind died and after his victory against cunimund alboin married rosamund to establish a bond with the remaining gepids name sg20gasparri 1990 p 20  the war also marked a watershed in the geo political history of the region as together with the lombard migration the following year it signalled the end of six centuries of germanic dominance in the pannonian basincurta 2001 p 204 
despite his success against the gepids alboin had failed to greatly increase his power and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the avars name jj29jarnut 1995 p 29  historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing alboin to undertake a migration even though there are indications that before the war with the gepids a decision was maturing to leave for italy a country thousands of lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the byzantines to fight in the gothic war name dbi  name jm152moorhead 2005 p 152  additionally the lombards would have known of the weakness of byzantine italy which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the goths in particular the so called  had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic with the  sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula  was recalledchristie 1998 p 60  nevertheless the lombards viewed italy as a rich land which promised great booty name jj29  name sg25gasparri 1990 p 25  assets alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only lombards but many other peoples of the region including       the remaining romans and a few ostrogoths but the most important group other than the lombards were the  of whom 20000 participated in the trek these saxons were tributaries to the frankish king  and their participation indicates that alboin had the support of the franks for his venture name dbi  name hs82schutz 2002 p 82 
the precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by alboin is impossible to know and many different estimates have been made  considers 150000 to be a realistic size a number which would make the lombards a more numerous force than the ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of italy jörg jarnut proposes 100000–150000 as an approximation wilfried menghen in die langobarden estimates 150000 to 200000 while stefano gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by alboin to be somewhere between 100000 and 300000 name sg25  name hs82  name nc634christie 1998 pp 63–64  name jj30jarnut 1995 p 30 
as a precautionary move alboin strengthened his alliance with the avars signing what paul calls a foedus perpetuum perpetual treaty and what is erred to in the 9th century  as a pactum et foedus amicitiae pact and treaty of friendship adding that the treaty was put down on paper by the conditions accepted in the treaty the avars were to take possession of pannonia and the lombards were promised military support in italy should the need arise also for a period of 200ampnbspyears the lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer italy failed thus leaving alboin with an alternative open the accord also had the advantage of protecting alboins rear as an avar occupied pannonia would make it difficult for the byzantines to bring forces to italy by land the agreement proved immensely successful and relations with the avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the lombard kingdompohl 1997 p 98  name hw286wolfram 1997 p 286 jarnut 1995 pp 29–30 
a further cause of the lombard migration into italy may have been an invitation from narses according to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources narses out of spite for having been removed by justinians successor justin ii called the lombards to italy often dismissed as an unreliable tradition name jj30 whitby 2001 p 91  it has been studied with attention by modern scholars in particular neil christie who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the byzantine state to settle in northern italy as  to help protect the region against the franks an arrangement that may have been disowned by justin ii after narses removal name jm152 christie 1998 pp 60–63 pohl 1997 pp 98–99  name rc186collins 1991 p 186

the lombard migration started on easter monday april 2 568 the decision to combine the departure with a christian celebration can be understood in the context of alboins recent conversion to  as attested by the presence of arian gothic missionaries at his court name jm152  name sp43palmieri 1996 pp 43–44  the conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations and intended to consolidate the migrations cohesion distinguishing them from the catholic romans it also connected alboin and his people to the gothic heritage and in this way obtain the support of the ostrogoths serving in the byzantine army as foederati name dbi gasparri 1990 pp 24–25  it has been speculated that alboins migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving ostrogoths in italy name jm152 
the season chosen for leaving pannonia was unusually early the germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march the reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring avars despite the friendship treaty nomadic peoples like the avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns as they needed enough forage for their horses a sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by alboin to ravage pannonia which created a safety zone between the lombards and the avars name hw286  name rc186 
the road followed by alboin to reach italy has been the subject of controversy as is the length of the trek according to neil christie the lombards divided themselves into migrational groups with a vanguard scouting the road probably following the  –  –  –  route while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them and possibly also because they were waiting for the saxons to join them on the road by september raiding parties were looting  but it was probably only in 569 that the  were crossed at the  the eyewitness  gives the date as may 20 or 21 name dbi  name sg25  name nc634  the 569 date for the entry into italy is not void of difficulties however and jörg jarnut believes the conquest of most of venetia had already been completed in 568 according to carlo guido mor a major difficulty remains in explaining how alboin could have reached milan on september 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the may of the same year name jj30  name sp43

the lombards penetrated into italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops  the byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty and the border forts may well have been left unmanned what seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated this agrees with paul the deacons narrative who speaks of a lombard takeover in  without any hindrancechristie 1998 pp 73 76 
the first town to fall into the lombards hands was  cividale del friuli the seat of the local magister militum name dbi  alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the  and made his nephew and    of the region with the specific duty of defending the borders from byzantine or avar attacks from the east gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those  or clans that he perred name jj30 christie 1998 pp 93–94  name hw2878wolfram 1997 pp 287–288 
alboins decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations until then the lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town the innovation adopted was part of alboins borrowing of roman and ostrogothic administrative models as in late antiquity the   city count was the main local authority with full administrative powers in his region but the shift from count comes to duke dux and from county comitatus to duchy ducatus also signalled the progressive militarization of italy name hw2878  the selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in pannonia for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the lombards now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in forum iulii a pattern that was repeated regularly by the lombards in their other duchieschristie 1998 p 77 
from forum iulii alboin next reached  the most important road junction in the northeast name hw288wolfram 1997 p 288  and the administrative capital of venetia the imminent arrival of the lombards had a considerable impact on the citys population the   fled with his clergy and flock to the island of  in byzantine controlled territory name dbi madden 2004 p 44 
from aquileia alboin took the  and swept through venetia taking in rapid succession  treviso  vicenza    and  bergamo the lombards faced difficulties only in taking  oderzo which alboin decided to avoid as he similarly avoided tackling the main venetian towns closer to the coast on the  such as   padova  monselice  and  name dbi  name hw288  the invasion of venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil spurring waves of ugees from the lombard controlled interior to the byzantine held coast often led by their bishops and resulting in new settlements such as  and lane 1991 p 7  name cah19humphries 2001 pp 535–536 richards 1979 p 34 
alboin moved west in his march invading the region of  north west italy and reaching its capital   on september 3 569 only to find it already abandoned by the  italiae vicar of italy the authority entrusted with the administration of the  archbishop  his clergy and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius italiae to find a safe haven in the byzantine port of  genoa alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of milan when he assumed the title of dominus italiae lord of italy his success also meant the collapse of byzantine defences in the northern part of the  and large movements of ugees to byzantine areas name plre3  name dbi christie 1998 p 78  name sg256gasparri 1990 pp 25–26 
several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial lombard advance in northern italy it has been suggested that the towns doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the gothic auxiliaries in the byzantine army but historians generally hold that lombard success occurred because italy was not considered by byzantium as a vital part of the empire especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of avars and  in the  and  in the east the byzantine decision not to contest the lombard invasion lects the desire of justinians successors to reorient the core of the empires polices eastward name sg256  name jj31 ostrogorsky 1993 p 68 
the impact of the lombard migration on the late roman aristocracy was disruptive especially in combination with the gothic war the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562 when the last gothic stronghold verona was taken name rc187collins 1991 p 187  many men of means pauls possessores either lost their lives or their goods but the exact extent of the despoliation of the roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate name jj31jarnut 1995 p 31 wickham 2005 pp 203 210 moorhead 2005 pp 156–157  the clergy was also greatly affected the lombards were mostly pagans and displayed little respect for the clergy and church property many churchmen left their  to escape from the lombards like the two most senior bishops in the north honoratus and paulinus however most of the s in the north sought an accommodation with the lombards as did in 569 the bishop of tarvisium  when he journeyed to the  to parley with alboin obtaining respect for the church and its goods in return for this act of homage it seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years the transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the  in lombard territory churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution name jj31 wolfram 1997 pp 288–289 richards 1979 pp 37–38 
in the view of pierre riché the disappearance of 220 bishops seats indicates that the lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the church name hs84schutz 2001 p 84  yet according to walter pohl the regions directly occupied by alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact with the bishoprics in such places rarely survivingpohl 1997 pp 124–125 
the first attested instance of strong resistance to alboins migration took place at the town of   which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years the town was of strategic importance sitting at the confluence of the rivers  and  and connected by waterways to ravenna the capital of byzantine italy and the seat of the  its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the  and the  name dbi  name jj30 christie 1998 p 79  name sg26gasparri 1990 p 26  name hw290wolfram 1997 p 290 
caul to maintain the initiative against the byzantines by 570 alboin had taken their last defences in northern italy except for the coastal areas of liguria and venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as  aosta  susa and the island of  in the  lake comorovagnati 2003 p 36  during alboins kingship the lombards crossed the  and plundered  but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding according to  it was probably only in 578–579 that  was conquered but jörg jarnut and others believe this began in some form under alboin although it was not completed by the time of his death name plre3  name hs82  name jj30  name cah19  name hw290 
alboins problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of ticinum the nature of the lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by theodoric over his goths and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces who led each band fara of warriors additionally the difficulties encountered by alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy as unlike the ostrogoths they had not entered italy as foederati but as enemies of the empire name dbi  name cah19 azzara 2009 pp 95–96  name wp99pohl 1997 p 99 
the kings disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of frankish  which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale the lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following  victory at  these attacks had lasting political consequences souring the previously cordial lombard frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the empire and the franks against the lombards a coalition agreed to by  in about 571 name plre3  name dbi  name hw290  name wp99 jarnut 1995 p 35  alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by gian piero bognetti is that alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on guntram as part of an alliance with the frankish king of   this view is met with scepticism by scholars such as wickham 1989 pp 30–31 
the weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern italy by the lombards in which modern scholars believe alboin played no role at all probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords however it is far from certain that the lombard takeover occurred during those years as very little is known of  and zottos respective rise to power in   and   name wp99 palmieri 1996 pp 52–53 moorhead 2005 p 153 christie 1998 pp 80–82

ticinum eventually fell to the lombards in either may or june 572 alboin had in the meantime chosen verona as his seat establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by theodoric this choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the gothic king name dbi 
it was in this palace that alboin was killed on june 28 572 in the account given by paul the deacon the most detailed narrative on alboins death history and saga intermingle almost inextricably much earlier and shorter is the story told by  in his chronica written about a decade after alboins murder according to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him called  pauls helmechismartindale 1992 sv hilmegis p 599  with the connivance of the queen helmichis then married the widow but the two were forced to escape to byzantine ravenna taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army which hints at the cooperation of byzantium  describes marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to lombard italy name plre3  name dbi collins 1991 pp 187–188 jarnut 1995 pp 31–32 
also contemporary is  account presented in the historia francorum and echoed by the later  gregorys account diverges in several respects from most other sources in his tale it is told how alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge eventually poisoning him she had previously fallen in love with one of her husbands servants and after the assassination tried to escape with him but they were captured and killed however historians including walter goffart place little trust in this narrative goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the historia and calls its account of alboins demise a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity name wg392goffart 1988 p 392 
elements present in marius account are echoed in pauls  which also contains distinctive features one of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the  in paul the events that lead to alboins downfall unfold in verona during a great feast alboin gets drunk and orders his wife rosamund to drink from his cup made from the skull of his father in law cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married rosamund alboin invited her to drink merrily with her father this reignited the queens determination to avenge her father name hs84  name sg1921gasparri 1990 pp 19–21  name hw291wolfram 1997 p 291  name wg391392goffart 1988 pp 391–392 
the tale has been often dismissed as a fable and paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief for this reason he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of ticinum in the hands of king  the use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and in particular among the lombards neighbours the avars skull cups are believed to be part of a  ritual where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead mans powers in this context stefano gasparri and wilfried menghen see in cunimunds skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the lombards by drinking from his enemys skull alboin was taking his vital strength as for the offering of the skull to rosamund that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the lombards and thus a cause of shame or humiliation alternatively it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation in the latter interpretation the queens answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge name hs84  name sg1921  name wg391392 
the episode is read in a radically different way by walter goffart according to him the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning with paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land because of his human weakness in this story the skull cup plays a key role as it unites  and barbarism goffart does not exclude the possibility that paul had really seen the skull but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established name hs84  name wg391392 
in her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in helmichis the kings foster brother and  arms bearer according to paul the queen then recruited the kings  bedchamberlain peredeo into the plot after having seduced him when alboin retired for his midday rest on june 28 care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded alboins sword was also removed leaving him defenceless when peredeo entered his room and killed him name plre3  name hw291  name jj32jarnut 1995 p 32  alboins remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps name wg392 
peredeos figure and role is mostly introduced by paul the origo had for the first time mentioned his name as peritheus but there his role had been different as he was not the assassin but the instigator of the assassination in the vein of his reading of the skull cup goffart sees peredeo as not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character he notes a similarity between peredeos name and the  word peritus meaning lost a representation of those lombards who entered into the service of the empire name wg393goffart 1988 p 393 
alboins death had a lasting impact as it deprived the lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn germanic entity his end also represents the death of the last of the line of the hero kings that had led the lombards through their migrations from the elba to italy his fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry with saxons and s celebrating his prowess in battle his heroism and the magical properties of his weapons name dbi  name sg20 wolfram 1997 p 285

to complete the  and legitimize his claim to the throne helmichis married the queen whose high standing arose not only from being the kings widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining gepid nation and as such her support was a guarantee of the gepids loyalty to helmichis the latter could also count on the support of the lombard garrison of verona where many may have opposed alboins aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the empire the byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot it was in their interest to stem the lombard tide by bringing a pro byzantine regime into power in verona and possibly in the long run break the unity of the lombards kingdom winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments name dbi  name sg26  name jj32  name nc82christie 1998 p 82  name hw292wolfram 1997 p 292 azzara 2009 p 96 
the coup ultimately failed as it met with the resistance of most of the warriors who were opposed to the kings assassination as a result the lombard garrison in ticinum proclaimed duke  the new king and helmichis rather than going to war against overwhelming odds escaped to ravenna with longinus assistance taking with him his wife his troops the royal treasure and alboins daughter  in ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other subsequently longinus sent albsuinda and the treasure to  name nc82  name hw292

soon after the failed attack afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the  fleet in the red sea or return to hormuz however he had been informed by  a privateer in the service of the hindu  that it would be easier to fight them in  where they had sheltered after the battle of diu name bhagamandalabhagamandala seetharama shastry charles j borges goa kanara portuguese relations 1498–1763 pp 34 36  and also of the illness of the sultan  and war between the  name bhagamandala  so he relied on surprise in the capture of goa from the  he thus completed another mission for portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal guest of kochi and had been coveting goa as the best trading port in the region
a first assault took place in goa from 4 march to 20 may 1510 after initial occupation feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications the cooling of hindu residents support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by  afonso used a truce offered by the sultan and abandoned the city in august his fleet was scattered and a palace revolt in kochi hindered his recovery so he headed to  new ships arrived from portugal which were intended for the nobleman diogo mendes de vasconcelos at malacca who had been given a rival command of the region

afonso explained to his armies why the portuguese wanted to capture malacca
the king of portugal has often commanded me to go to the straits becausethis was the best place to intercept the trade which the moslemscarry on in these parts so it was to do our lord’s service that we were brought here by taking malacca we would close the straits so that never again would the moslems be able to bring their spices by this route i am very sure that if this malacca trade is taken out of their hands cairo and mecca will be completely lost the commentaries of the great afonso de albuquerque
in february 1511 through a friendly hindu merchant nina chatu afonso received a letter from rui de araújo one of the nineteen portuguese held at malacca since 1509 it urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release and gave details of the fortifications afonso showed it to diogo mendes de vasconcelos as an argument to advance in a joint fleet in april 1511 after fortifying goa he gathered a force of about 900 portuguese 200 hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships name ricklefsp23  he then sailed to  against orders and despite the protest of diogo mendes who claimed command of the expedition afonso eventually centralized the portuguese government in the indian ocean after the malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the king to explain his disagreement with diogo mendes suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the portuguese in india name foundations  under his command was  who had participated in the failed embassy of diogo lopes de sequeira in 1509

afonso made a bold approach to the city his ships decorated with banners firing cannon volleys he declared himself lord of all the navigation demanded the sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post the sultan eventually freed the prisoners but was unimpressed by the small portuguese contingent afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration the city being divided by the malacca river the connecting bridge was a strategic point so at dawn on 25 july the portuguese landed and fought a tough battle facing poisoned arrows taking the bridge in the evening after fruitlessly waiting for the sultans reaction they returned to the ships and prepared a  offered by chinese merchants filling it with men artillery and sandbags commanded by  it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge the day after all had landed after a fierce fight during which the sultan appeared with an army of s the defenders were dispersed and the sultan fled name foundations  afonso waited for the reaction of the sultan merchants approached asking for portuguese protection they were given banners to mark their premises a sign that they would not be looted on 15 august the portuguese attacked again but the sultan had fled the city under strict orders they looted the city but respected the banners name bosworth2007

 melanchrus – he was overthrown sometime between 612ampnbspbc and 609ampnbspbc by a faction that in addition to the brothers of alcaeus included  later renowned as one of the  alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved
 myrsilus – it is not known when he came to power but some verses by alcaeus frag 129 indicate that the poet his brothers and pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that pittacus subsequently betrayed them alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote a drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrants death frag 332
 pittacus – the dominant political figure of his time he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of mytilene and appears to have governed well 590 580ampnbspbc even allowing alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace
sometime before 600ampnbspbc mytilene fought athens for control of  and alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting according to the historian histories 595  the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend melanippus it is thought that alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile including at least one visit to egypt his older brother antimenidas appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of  and probably took part in the conquest of askelon alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of antimenides return including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent frag 350 and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home frag 357
alcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of  and since both poets composed for the entertainment of mytilenean friends they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis such as at the kallisteia an annual festival celebrating the islands federation under mytilene held at the messon erred to as temenos in frs 129 and 130 where sappho performed publicly with female choirs alcaeus erence to sappho in terms more typical of a divinity as holy pure honey smiling sappho fr 384 may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festivalgregory nagy lyric and greek myth in the cambridge companion to greek mythology ed r d woodward cambridge university press 2007 pp 19–51 http  chsharvardedu wa pagertn articlewrapperampbdc 12ampmn 2654  the lesbian or aeolic school of poetry reached in the songs of sappho and alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after wards approachedjames s easby smith the songs of alcaeus w h lowdermilk and co washington 1901  and it was assumed by later greek critics and during the early centuries of the christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers a theme which became a favourite subject in art as in the urn pictured above
the poetic works of alcaeus were collected into ten books with elaborate commentaries by the alexandrian scholars  and  sometime in the 3rd century bc and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form varying in size from mere phrases such as wine window into a man fr 333 to entire groups of verses and stanzas such as those quoted below fr 346 alexandrian scholars numbered him in their  one lyric poet per muse among these  was held by many ancient critics to be pre eminent http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts quintilian institutio_oratoria 10ahtml#161 10161 cf  http  classicpersuasionorg pw longinus desub011htm#xxxiii 335  but some gave precedence to alcaeus instead name digitized1james easby smith the songs of alcaeus digitized without page numbers  the canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups with alcaeus sappho and  being monodists or solo singers with the following characteristicsandrew mmiller trans greek lyric an anthology in translation hackett publishing co 1996 intro xiii 
 they composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them
 they wrote in their native dialects alcaeus and sappho in aeolic dialect anacreon in ionic
 they perred quite short metrically simple stanzas or strophes which they re used in many poems — hence the alcaic and sapphic stanzas named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them
the other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses however this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance even the private lections of alcaeus ostensibly sung at dinner parties still retain a public function name university19gregory nagy lyric and greek myth in the cambridge companion to greek mythology ed r d woodward cambridge university press 2007 pp 19–51 
critics often seek to understand alcaeus in comparison with sappho
the roman poet horace also compared the two describing alcaeus as more full throatedly singing name classics116james michie trans the odes of horace penguin classics 1964 p 116  — see  below alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own down to earth style and sapphos more celestial qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess as cited above and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane each emphasising different elements in that balance name university19 
 exhorts us to observe in alcaeus the sublimity brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power his splendid figures and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairsimit 422 quoted from easby smith in songs of alcaeus  while  after commending alcaeus for his excellence in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals in his language he is concise exalted caul and often like an orator goes on to add but he descended into wantonnness and amours though better fitted for higher thingsquintillian 10163 quoted by dcampbell in glp p 288 
the works of alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres
 political songs alcaeus often composed on a political theme covering the power struggles on lesbos with the passion and vigour of a partisan cursing his opponentsfr 129  rejoicing in their deaths name autogenerated1fr 332  delivering blood curdling homilies on the consequences of political inactionfr s262  and exhorting his comrades to heroic defiance as in one of his ship of state allegoriesfr 6  commenting on alcaeus as a political poet the scholar  once observed that if you removed the meter you would find political rhetoricimit 422 quoted by campbell in glp p 286 
 drinking songs according to the grammarian  alcaeus made every occasion an excuse for drinking and he has provided posterity several quotes in proof of itathenaeus 10430c  alcaeus exhorts his friends to drink in celebration of a tyrants death name autogenerated1fr 332  to drink away their sorrowsfrs 335 346  to drink because life is shortfr 38a  and along the lines in vino veritasfr 333  to drink through winter stormsfr 338  and to drink through the heat of summerfr 347  the latter poem in fact paraphrases verses from hesiod op 582–8  re casting them in asclepiad meter and aeolian dialect
 hymns alcaeus sang about the gods in the spirit of the  to entertain his companions rather than to glorify the gods and in the same meters that he used for his secular lyricsdavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 p 286  there are for example fragments in sapphic meter praising the fr 34a  fr 308b  and the river fr 45  a river significant in lesbian mythology since it was down its waters that the head of  was believed to have floated singing eventually crossing the sea to lesbos and ending up in a temple of apollo as a symbol of lesbian supremacy in songdavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 pp 292–3  according to  the hymn to hermes was imitated by horace in one of his own sapphic odes c110 mercuri facunde nepos atlantisdavid campbell monody in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and e kenney eds cambridge university press 1985 p 213 
 love songs almost all alcaeus amorous verses mentioned with disapproval by quintilian above have vanished without trace there is a brief erence to his love poetry in a passage by cicero tusc disp 471   who often wrote in imitation of alcaeus sketches in verse one of the lesbian poets favourite subjects — lycus of the black hair and eyes c13211 12 nigris oculis nigroque crine decorum it is possible that alcaeus wrote amorously about sappho as indicated in an earlier quotefr 384 
 miscellaneous alcaeus wrote on such a wide variety of subjects and themes that contradictions in his character emerge the grammarian athenaeus quoted some verses about perfumed ointments to prove just how unwarlike alcaeus could befr 362 athenaeus 15687d  and he quoted his description of the armour adorning the walls of his housefr 357  as proof that he could be unusually warlike for a lyric poetathenaeus 14627a  other examples of his readiness for both warlike and unwarlike subjects are lyrics celebrating his brothers heroic exploits as a babylonian mercenaryfr 350  and  lyrics sung in a rare meter sapphic ionic in minore in the voice of a distressed girlfr 10b  wretched me who share in all ills — possibly imitated by horace in an ode in the same meter c312 miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci name literature214david campbell monody in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and e kenney eds cambridge university press 1985 p 214  he also wrote sapphic stanzas on homeric themes but in unhomeric style comparing  unfavourably with  the mother of fr 42

the greek meter here is relatively simple comprising the greater  adroitly used to convey for example the rhythm of jostling cups   the language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences — the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning comprising an exhortation lets drink a rhetorical question why are we waiting for the lamps and a justifying statement only an inch of daylight leftdavid campbell monody in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and e kenney eds cambridge university press 1985 p 212  the meaning is clear and uncomplicated the subject is drawn from personal experience and there is an absence of poetic ornament such as simile or metaphor like many of his poems eg frs 38 326 338 347 350 it begins with a verb in this case lets drink and it includes a proverbial expression only an inch of daylight left though it is possible that he coined it himself name david a 1982 page 287 
alcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm tossed ship of state the following fragment of a hymn to castor and polydeuces the  is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyagedavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 pp 286 289 
hither now to me from your isle of pelops
you powerful children of zeus and leda
showing youselves kindly by nature castor
and polydeuces
travelling abroad on swift footed horses
over the wide earth over all the ocean
how easily you bring deliverance from
deaths gelid rigor
landing on tall ships with a sudden great bound
a far away light up the forestays running
bringing radiance to a ship in trouble
sailed in the darkness
the poem was written in s a verse form popularly associated with his compatriot sappho but in which he too excelled here paraphrased in english to suggest the same rhythms there were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remaindavid a campbell greek lyric vol i loeb classical library 1990 p 247  the far away light  is a erence to  an electrical discharge supposed by ancient greek mariners to be an epiphany of the dioscuri but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by a modern scholar—such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry see  below this poem doesnt begin with a verb but with an adverb Δευτέ but still communicates a sense of action he probably performed his verses at  for friends and political allies—men for whom loyalty was essential particularly in such troubled times name literature214 
the roman poet  modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of alcaeus rendering the lesbian poets verse forms including alcaic and sapphic stanzas into concise latin — an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odeshorace od 330  in his second book in an ode composed in alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm he imagines meeting alcaeus and sappho in 
quam paene furvae regna e

how close the realm of dusky proserpine

seclusion sappho on the aeolian lyre

 compared alcaeus to sappho in  where sappho is imagined to speak as follows
nec plus alcaeus consors patriaeque lyraeque

receive more praise although he resounds more grandlyovid her1529s cited and translated by david a campbell greek lyric i sappho and alcaeus loeb classical library 1982 p 39 
the story of alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion name archive1901 david a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classic press 1982 pp 285–305  his verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition — generations of scribes copying an authors collected works such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of s odes — but haphazardly in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at  and other locations in egypt sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively adding little by little to the worlds store of poetic fragments
ancient scholars quoted alcaeus in support of various arguments thus for example heraclitus the allegoristdonald a russell and david konstan eds and trans heraclitushomeric problems society of biblical literature 2005 http  booksgooglecomau booksid plf2pney53acamppg pp14amplpg pp14ampdq heraclitus+%2b+allegoryampsource blampots pk8wry0yn7ampsig 1d uqwqnmjgdzkjcpb9qghqrhtmamphl enampei e8ois7pylo2aswoo1tx8cwampsa xampoi book_resultampct resultampresnum 6ampved 0cb4q6aewbq#v onepageampq alcaeusampf false introduction  quoted fr 326 and part of fr 6 about ships in a storm in his study on homers use of allegoryheraclitus all5  the hymn to hermes fr308b was quoted by hephaestion ench xiv1  and both he and  the rhetorician quoted the first two lines of fr 350hephaestion ench x 3 libanus or 135  celebrating the return from babylon of alcaeus brother the rest of fr 350 was paraphrased in prose by the historian geographer strabo 13617  many fragments were supplied in quotes by  principally on the subject of wine drinking but fr 333 wine window into a man was quoted much later by the byzantine grammarian tzetzes alex 212 
the first modern publication of alcaeus verses appeared in a greek and latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by michael neander published at basle in 1556 this was followed by another edition of the nine poets collected by  and published in paris in 1560 fulvius ursinus compiled a fuller collection of alcaic fragments including a commentary which was published at antwerp in 1568 the first separate edition of alcaeus was by christian david jani and it was published at halle in 1780 the next separate edition was by august matthiae leipzig 1827
some of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century thus for example two separate quotes by athenaeusathenaeus 15674cd 15687d  were united by  to form fr 362 three separate sources were combined to form fr 350 as mentioned above including a prose paraphrase from strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of otto hoffmann müller karl otfried ein bruder des dichters alkäos ficht unter nebukadnezar rheinisches museum 1 1827287  and  the discovery of the oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research in fact eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri — frs 9 38a 42 45 34 129 130 and most recently s262 these fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with educated guesses including for example a brilliant supplement by  in fr 34 a hymn to the dioscuri that includes a description of  in the ships riggingdavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classic press 1982 p 290  working with only eight letters  or protrntes bowra conjured up a phrase that brilliantly develops the meaning and the euphony of the poem  or proton ontrechontes describing luminescence running along the forestays

ealdred had returned to england by 1055 and brought with him a copy of the  a  with him an extant copy of this work currently manuscript  has been identified as a copy owned by ealdred name king128  it appears likely that the  a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of  was introduced into england by ealdred sometime before 1059 probably he brought it back from germany possibly in concert with harold name rex77rex harold ii p 77

ealdred became involved with the see of ramsbury after its bishop herman got into a dispute with king edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to  herman wished to move the seat of his see but edward used permission for the move ealdred was a close associate of hermans name king128  and the historian  called herman something of an alter ego to ealdred name loyn61loyn english church p 61  according to the medieval chronicler  ealdred was given the see of ramsbury to administer while herman remained outside england herman returned in 1058 and resumed his bishopric there is no contemporary documentary evidence of ealdreds administration of ramsbury name king128

very little documentary evidence is available from ealdreds time as bishop of worcester only five leases that he signed survive and all date from 1051 to 1053 two further leases exist in  as copies only how the  was administered when ealdred was abroad is unclear although it appears that  the prior of the  performed the religious duties in the diocese on the financial side the  states that  who became abbot of  in 1058 administered worcester before he became abbot name king134king ealdred anglo norman studies xviii pp 134–137 
cynesige the archbishop of york died on 22 december 1060 and ealdred was elected  on christmas day 1060 although a bishop was promptly appointed to heord none was named to worcester and it appears that ealdred intended to retain worcester along with york which several of his predecessors had done name king130  there were a few reasons for this one of which was political as the kings of england perred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism another reason was that york was not a wealthy see and worcester was holding worcester along with york allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself name loyn158loyn governance p 158

john of worcester a medieval chronicler stated that ealdred crowned king harold ii in 1066 although the  chroniclers mention stigand as the officiating prelate name hindley335  given ealdreds known support of godwins family john of worcester is probably correct name dnb  stigands position as archbishop was canonically suspect and as earl harold had not allowed stigand to consecrate one of the earls churches it is unlikely that harold would have allowed stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation name rex199rex harold pp 199–200  arguments for stigand having performed the coronation however rely on the fact that no other english source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony all norman sources name stigand as the presider name barlowchurch60barlow english church 1000–1066 p 60 footnote 4  in all events ealdred and harold were close and ealdred supported harolds bid to become king name harold132  name harold117walker harold p 117  ealdred perhaps accompanied harold when the new king went to york and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after harolds consecration name douglas183douglas william the conqueror p 183 
according to the medieval chronicler  after the  harold entrusted the loot gained from  to ealdred name lawson42n93lawson battle of hastings p 42 footnote 93  gaimar asserts that king harold did this because he had heard of duke williams landing in england and needed to rush south to counter it name lawson75lawson battle of hastings p 75  after the battle of hastings ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate edgar the Ætheling edward the exiles son as king but eventually he submitted to william the conqueror at  name huscroft19huscroft ruling england p 19  name williams32williams english and the norman conquest p 32  john of worcester says that the group supporting edgar vacillated over what to do while william ravaged the countryside name rex130rex harold ii p 130  which led to ealdred and edgars submission to william name douglas206douglas william the conqueror p 206 
ealdred crowned william king on  1066 name powell1powell and wallis house of lords p 1  an innovation in williams coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning ealdred asked the assembled crowd in english if it was their wish that william be crowned king the  then did the same but in  name powell1  in march 1067 william took ealdred with him when william returned to  along with the other english leaders earl  earl  edgar the Ætheling and archbishop stigand name harold185walker harold pp 185–187  ealdred at  1068 performed the coronation of  williams wife name powell13  the  or song commending a ruler that was performed at matildas coronation may have been composed by ealdred himself for the occasion name queen183stafford queen emma amp queen edith p 183  in 1069 when the northern s rebelled against william and attempted to install edgar the Ætheling as king ealdred continued to support william name williams32  he was the only northern leader to support william however name kapelle109kapelle norman conquest of the north p 109   ealdred was back at york by 1069 he died there on 11 september 1069 name handbook224  and was buried in his episcopal cathedral he may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in 1068 and 1069 name powell13  the medieval chronicler william of malmesbury records a story that when the new sheriff of worcester urse dabetot  encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for  ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him saying thou are called urse may you have gods curse name qbates153quoted in bates william the conqueror p 153 the exact sentence in bates is urses usal to move it drew a poetic old english curse from the archbishop which began thou are called urse may you have gods curse 
after ealdreds death one of the restraints on williams treatment of the english was removed name barlow57  ealdred was one of a few native englishmen who william appears to have trusted and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate englishmen into the administration although such efforts did not entirely stop name bates156bates william the conqueror p 156  in 1070 a church council was held at westminster and a number of bishops were deposed by 1073 there were only two englishmen in episcopal sees and by the time of williams death in 1089 there was only one  of worcester name barlow57barlow english church 1066–1154 p 57

alexander i jagiellon   5 august 1461 – 19 august 1506 of the  was the grand duke of  and later also king of   he was the fourth son of  he was elected grand duke of lithuania on the death of his father 1492 and king of poland on the death of his brother  1501
alexander was born as son of the king  of  and  daughter of the king  alexanders shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the polish senate and nobility  who deprived him of control of the mint then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the polish kings curtailed his prerogatives and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position for want of funds alexander was unable to resist the grand master of the  or prevent grand duke of muscovy  from ravaging  with the  the most the grand duke of lithuania could do was to garrison  and other strongholds and employ his wife helena the tsars daughter to mediate a truce between his father in law and himself after the disastrous  1500 in the terms of the truce lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist russian state
during his reign poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality  only the death of  the great  of moldavia enabled poland still to hold her own on the  while the liberality of  who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander  and other financial help enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order
alexander jagellon never felt at home in poland and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate  who justified his masters confidence by his great victory over the tatars at  5 august 1506 news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in  there is some evidence that he had at least one son leading to a surviving jagiellonian branch although this is not conclusivehttp  ciekawostkihistorycznepl 2011 12 28 krolewska poradnia malzenska aleksander jagiellonczyk i helena moskiewska  
it is important to note that alexander was the last known ruler of the  dynasty to have maintained the familys ancestral  from his death polish became the sole language of the family thus fully  the  family
in 1931 during the urbishment of  the forgotten sarcophagus of alexander was discovered and has since been put on display

alexander iii  or alexander alexandrovich romanov  10 march 1845 – 1 november 1894 was the penultimate  of   and  from  until his death on  he was highly  and reversed some of the liberal orms of his father  during alexanders reign russia fought no major wars for which he was styled the peacemaker 
grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on 10 march 1845 at the  in   the second son of   and his wife 
in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft hearted liberal father and still less to his ined philosophic sentimental chivalrous yet cunning great uncle emperor  who could have been given the title of the first gentleman of  although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the  alexander was seen as lacking inement and elegance indeed he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects his straightforward abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness while his direct unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough hewn immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities more than six feet tall about 19ampnbspm he was also noted for his immense physical strength a   on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent
an account from the memoirs of the artist  gives one impression of alexander iii
blockquoteafter a performance of the ballet  at the  i first caught sight of the emperor i was struck by the size of the man and although cumbersome and heavy he was still a mighty figure there was indeed something of the  russian peasant about him the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me as he passed where i was standing he raised his head for a second and to this day i can remember what i felt as our eyes met it was a look as cold as steel in which there was something threatening even frightening and it struck me like a blow the tsars gaze the look of a man who stood above all others but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him in later years i came into contact with the emperor on several occasions and i felt not the slightest bit timid in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind simple and even almost homely blockquote
though he was destined to be a strongly counter orming emperor alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life as he had an elder brother  who seemed of robust constitution even when this elder brother first displayed symptoms of delicate health the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously and he was betrothed to  daughter of  and  of denmark and whose siblings included  and  great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicolas as  whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period this included acquaintance with   and  and 
alexander became  as  with nicholass sudden death in 1865 it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under  then a professor of  at  and later from 1880  of the  of the orthodox church in russia pobedonostsev awakened in his pupil little love of abstract study or prolonged intellectual exertion but instilled into the young mans mind the belief that zeal for  thought was an essential factor of russian  to be cultivated by every right minded emperor while he was heir apparent—1865 to 1881—alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government
on his deathbed alexanders elder brother nicolas is said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée princess dagmar of denmark should marry his successor this wish was swiftly realized when on  in the imperial chapel of the  in  alexander wed dagmar who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name  the union proved a happy one to the end unlike his fathers there was no adultery in his marriage
later on tsesarevich alexander became estranged from  his father not only did tsesarevich alexander disagree with the political views of alexander ii but he also was indignant by his fathers long standing relationship with  with whom alexander ii had several illegitimate children while his mother  was suffering from chronic ill healthvan der kiste john the romanovs 1818–1959 sutton publishing 2003 p 94  to the scandal of many at court including tsesarevich alexander alexander ii married catherine only a month after empress marie alexandrovnas death in 1880
on 1 march 1881 os alexanders father emperor  was assassinated by members of the  organization  as a result he ascended to the russian imperial throne in  on 13 march 1881 he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed on 27 may 1883
on the day of his assassination alexander ii had signed an  setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch on ascending to the throne however alexander iii took s advice and canceled the policy before its publication he made it clear that his  would not be limited
all of alexander iiis internal orms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his fathers reign the new emperor believed that remaining true to russian  the ideology introduced by his grandfather emperor  would save russia from revolutionary agitation alexanders political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality language and religion as well as one form of administration he attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the  throughout the empire including to his   and other non russian subjects with the exception of the  by the patronization of y  by the destruction of the remnants of german polish and  institutions in the respective provinces and by the weakening of  through persecution of the s the latter policy was implemented in the  of 1882 which banned jews from inhabiting rural areas and s even within the  and restricted the occupations in which they could engage 
alexander weakened the power of the  elective local administrative bodies resembling british s and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land owning proprietors appointed by his government these land captains zemskiye nachalniki were feared and resented throughout the empires peasant communities these acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought imperial administration under the emperors personal control
in such policies emperor alexander iii had the encouragement of  who retained control of the church in russia through his long  procuratorship of the holy synod from 1880 to 1905 and who became tutor to alexanders son and heir nicolas pobedonostsev appesars as toporov in tolstoys novel resurrection other conservative advisors included count  minister of education and later of internal affairs and  d a tolstoys successor in the latter post  and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy – as did the novelist 
encouraged by its successful assassination of alexander ii the  movement began planning the murder of alexander iii the  uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators including  the older brother of  were captured and hanged on  on  the imperial train  in an  at  at the moment of the crash the royal family was in the dining car its roof collapsed and alexander supposedly held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors the onset of alexander’s kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident
the famine of 1891–1892 and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity as the russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief among others  helped organize soup kitchens and  directed anti cholera precautions in several villages
in foreign affairs alexander iii was a man of peace but not at any price and held that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it though he was indignant at the conduct of german chancellor  towards russia he avoided an open rupture with  and even revived the  for a period of time and in 1887 signed the  with the germans however in 1890 the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of bismarck by the new german emperor  for whom the tsar had an immense dislike and the wilhelm governments unwillingness to renew the treatyvan der kiste john the romanovs 1818–1959 sutton publishing 2003 p 162  in response alexander iii then began cordial relations with france eventually entering into an  with the french in 1892
despite chilly relations with berlin the tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the german frontier with regard to bulgaria he exercised similar self control the efforts of prince alexander and afterwards of  to destroy russian influence in the principality excited his indignation but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms
in n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending russian domination without provoking conflict with the  see  and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand his reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of  but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress
alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at  manor near  on the  coast where their children were immersed in a scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty
alexander deprecated foreign influence and german influence in particular so the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity with a view to realizing his ideal of a russia homogeneous in language administration and religion with such ideas he had not  been able to be in cordial agreement with his father who though a patriot had german sympathies often used the german language in his private relations occasionally ridiculed the  and based his foreign policy on the prussian alliance 
some differences had first appeared during the  when alexander ii supported the cabinet of  while the tsesarevich did not conceal his sympathies for the french it had reappeared during the years 1875–1879 when the  excited russian society at first the tsesarevich was more slavophile than the government but his  nature preserved him from many exaggerations and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in  where he commanded the left wing of the invading army  never consulted on political questions alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner after many mistakes and disappointments the army reached  and the  was signed but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the

the tsesarevich could point to these results as confirming the views he had expressed during the franco prussian war and he concluded that for russia the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization in accordance with this conviction he suggested that certain orms should be introduced
following his fathers assassination alexander iii was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the winter palace as a result alexander relocated his family to the  located twenty miles south of st petersburg making it his primary residence under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into st petersburg but even then he would stay in the  as opposed to the winter palace
in the 1860s alexander fell madly in love with his mothers lady in waiting princess maria elimovna meshcherskaya dismayed to learn that prince wittgenstein had made her a proposal in spring 1866 he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights to the sovereignty in order to marry his beloved dusenka on 19 may 1866 alexander ii informed his son that russia had come to an agreement with the parents of princess dagmar of denmark his tenth cousin before then she had been the fiancée of his elder brother nicholas who had died in 1865 but alexander used to travel to copenhagen declaring that he did not love dagmar and wanted to marry maria the emperor flew into a rage and ordered alexander to go straight to denmark and to propose to princess dagmar the tsesarevich realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first the only thing left to do was to write in his diary farewell dear dusenka maria was forced to leave russia accompanied by her aunt princess chernyshova almost a year after her first appearance in paris  fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867 maria died giving birth to a child  alexanders reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown
alexander was happily married to maria feodorovna formerly princess dagmar of denmark and was the father of six children five of whom survived into adulthood  b 1868  b 1871  b 1875  1878 and  b 1882 of his five surviving children he was closest to his youngest two

alexander i or aleksandar obrenović  Александар Обреновић 14 august 1876 – 11 june 1903 was king of  from 1889 to 1903 when he and his wife queen draga were  by a group of army officers  led by captain 
in 1889 alexanders father  unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life proclaiming alexander king of serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age his mother  became his regent his parents were second cousins
in 1893 king alexander aged sixteen arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age dismissed the s and their government and took the royal authority into his own hands his action won popular support as did his appointment of a radical ministry
in may 1894 king alexander arbitrarily abolished king milans liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869 his attitude during the  was one of strict 
in 1894 the young king brought his father milan back to serbia and in 1898 appointed him commander in chief of the serbian army during that time milan was regarded as the de facto ruler of the country
in the summer of 1900 king alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed madame  formerly a lady in waiting to his mother and 12 years older than him the projected union initially aroused great opposition he did not consult with his father who had been on vacation in  and making arrangements to secure the hand of  princess  for his son or his  dr vladan Đorđević who was visiting the   at the time of the announcement both immediately resigned from their respective offices and alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet alexanders mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom she was known to have been seen in the nearby countries such as austria hungary and bulgaria
opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding the marriage duly took place in august 1900 even so the unpopularity of the union weakened the kings position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large
king alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a   of his own initiative introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of serbia the system of two chambers  and   this reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which already dissatisfied with the kings marriage became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of  lieutenant nikodije was to be proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne
meanwhile the independence of the  and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to king alexander in march 1903 the king suspended the  for half an hour time enough to publish the decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state this arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country
the general impression was that as much as the  was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections king alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim queen dragas brother as the  to the throne in spite of this it had been agreed with the serbian government that  who was married to  the granddaughter of  an aunt of king milan would be proclaimed heir presumptive in the event that the marriage of king alexander and queen draga was childless name njeg  
apparently to prevent queen dragas brother being named heir presumptive but in reality to replace alexander obrenović with  a conspiracy was organized by a group of army officers headed by captain  also known as apis and norman perović a young greek orthodox militant who was in the pay of the c l sulzberger the fall of eagles p202 crown publishers new york 1977  as well as the leader of the   which would assassinate  in 1914 several politicians were also part of the conspiracy and allegedly included former prime minister  name sulzberger p202sulzberger p202  the royal couples  was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the queens bedroom there is another possibility used in a serbian tv history series the end of the obrenović dynasty in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret  hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom the room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queens wardrobe over it after the wedding
the conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of may 29 1903 king alexander and queen draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and according to eyewitness accounts thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure name sulzberger p202  the king was only 26 years old at the time of his death king alexander and queen draga were buried in the crypt of

nevertheless although the sassanids were checked for the time name southern pg 62southern pg 62  the conduct of the  showed an extraordinary lack of discipline name canduci pg 61canduci pg 61  in 232 there was a mutiny in the syrian legion who proclaimed  emperorvictor 242  alexander managed to suppress the uprising and taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the  name canduci pg 59canduci pg 59   the emperor returned to  and celebrated a triumph in 233 name southern pg 62southern pg 62 
after the persian war alexander returned to antioch with the famous  one of the greatest fathers of the christian church alexanders mother julia mammaea asked for him to tutor alexander in  while alexander was being educated in the christian doctrines the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by germanic and sarmatian tribes a new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after alexanders success in the persian war in ad 234 the barbarians crossed the rhine and danube in hordes that even caused panic at the gates of rome the soldiers serving under alexander who were already demoralized after their costly war against the persians were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaderscampbell 54 
as word of the invasion spread the emperor took the front line and went to battle against the germanic invaders the romans prepared heavily for the war against the germanics building a brigade of ships to carry the entire battalion across however at this point in alexanders career he still knew little about being a general because of this he hoped the sole threat of his armies might be enough to persuade the germanics to surrender   severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among the germanic legions name western press association  due to incurring heavy losses against the persians and on the advice of his mother alexander attempted to buy the germanic tribes off so as to gain time
it was this decision that resulted in the  looking down upon alexander they considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be emperor under these circumstances  the army swiftly looked to replace alexander gaius iulius verus maximinus was the next best option he was a soldier from thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status name western press association  he was also a man with superior personal strength rising from peasantry to ultimately being the one chosen for the throne with the thracians hailing came the end of the severan dynasty name the saylor foundation  with his own army growing with animosity and turning against him the path for his assassination was paved
alexander was forced to face his german enemies in the early months of 235 by the time he and his mother arrived the situation had settled and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence trying to bribe the german army to surrender was the more sensible course of actioncanduci pg61  according to historians it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity pusillanimity was responsible for the revolt of alexander’s army resulting in severus falling victim to the swords of his own men name valentine nind hopkins 240  this was following the nomination of maximinus as emperor alexander was assassinated march 19 235 together with his mother in a mutiny of the  at  while at a meeting with his generals name southern pg 63southern pg 63   these assassinations secured the throne for maximinus name benario alexander severusbenario alexander severus 
 documents two theories that elaborate on the assassination of alexander severus the first claims that the disaffection of mammaea was the main motive behind the homicide however lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory where alexander is murdered in sicilia located in britain in an open tent after his lunch alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops they compared him to  a divisive and unpopular emperor whose own assassination paved the way for alexanders reign a german servant entered the tent and initiated the call for the emperor’s assassination an attack in which many of the troops joined alexanders attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the emperors assassination within minutes alexander was dead name valentine nind hopkins 240  after alexanders death his economic policies were completely discarded and the roman currency was devalued this marked the beginning of the crisis of the third century a time period in which the roman empire came close to falling apart entirely name the saylor foundation 
alexander was the last of the syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scalecampbell pg 55  his death signaled the end of the  and the beginning of the chaotic period known as the  which brought the empire to near collapse name canduci pg 61canduci pg 61 
alexanders death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for roman emperors though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during alexanders time emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs name campbell pg 69campbell pg 69  thus alexanders taking of his mothers advice not to get involved in battle his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the germanic threat and the relative failure of his military campaign against the persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers name campbell pg 69campbell pg 69  indeed maximinus was able to overthrow alexander by harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward  name campbell pg 69campbell pg 69   yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor the legions paved the way for a half century of widespread chaos and instability
alexanders reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline name campbell pg 196campbell pg 196  in 223 the  murdered their  ulpian name campbell pg 196   and did so in alexanders presence and despite the emperors pleas name canduci pg 61   the soldiers then fought a three day battle against the populace of rome and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire name campbell pg 197campbell pg 197  dio also gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time saying that they would rather just surrender to the enemy name campbell pg 197   different reasons are given for this breakdown of military discipline campbell points to blockquotethe decline in the prestige of the severan dynasty the feeble nature of alexander himself who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mothers advice and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure name campbell pg 197   blockquote
herodian on the other hand was convinced that the emperors miserliness partly the result of his mothers greed and slowness to bestow donatives were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under alexander name campbell pg 197  
according to canduci alexander is remembered as an emperor who was level headed well meaning and conscientious but his fatal flaw was his domination by his mother and grandmother name canduci pg 61   not only did this undermine his authority but his mothers influence was the cause of alexanders least popular actions convincing him not to take part in battle and trying to buy off the warring germanic barbarians

severus alexander became emperor when he was 13 years old making him the youngest emperor in romes history until the ascension of gordian iii his grandmother believed that he had more potential to rule than her other grandson the increasingly unpopular then emperor elagabaluscanduci pg 60  thus to preserve her own position she had elagabalus adopt the young alexander and then arranged for his assassination securing the throne for alexanderwells pg 266  the roman army hailed alexander emperor on march 13 222 immediately instilling him with the titles of augustus pater patriae and pontifex maximus throughout his life alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother maesa and mother mamaea alexanders grandmother died in 223 leaving his mother as the sole influence upon alexanders actions as a young immature and inexperienced 13 year old alexander knew little about government and the role of ruling over an empire because of this throughout his entire reign he was a puppet of his mothers advice and entirely under her jurisdiction a prospect that was not popular among the soldierscanduci pg 60 61 
alexander was married three times his most famous wife was   whom he married in 225 sallustia orbiana was 16 years old when marrying alexander severus as the result of an arranged marriage by alexanders mother julia mamaea however as soon as orbiana received the title of augusta mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of alexanders wife due to her excessive desire of all regal female titles name benario alexander severus   he divorced and exiled her in 227 after her father  was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the emperor name canduci pg 59canduci pg 59   another wife was sulpicia memmia a member of one of the most ancient patrician families in rome her father was a man of consular rank her grandfathers name was catulushistoria augusta life of severus alexander 203  the identity of alexanders third wife is unknown alexander fathered no children with all three wives
concerning religious matters alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel and had the motto do unto others as thou wouldst have them do unto thee inscribed on his palace and upon various public buildings he was extremely tolerant of not only christians but also  as he continued all privileges towards jews during his reign  alexander also claimedly placed images of abraham and jesus in his oratory along with other roman deities and classical figures

alexander jannaeus also known as alexander jannai yannai  אלכסנדר ינאי was king of  from 103ampnbspbc to 76ampnbspbc during the  the son of  he inherited the throne from his brother  and appears to have married his brothers widow shlomtzion or shelomit also known as  according to the biblical law of  levirate marriage although  is inexplicit on that point since alexander jannaeus was a high priest he was technically breaking jewish law according to the  the laws in leviticus state that a jewish high priest is forbidden to marry a widow the law in leviticus would have taken precedence over the biblical law in deuteronomy that allowed the marriage of a non high priest individual to a childless brothers widow
his likely full hebrew name was jonathan he may have been the high priest jonathan rather than his great uncle of the same name who established the  fortress under the name king yannai he appears as a wicked tyrant in the  lecting his conflict with the  party he is among the more colorful historical figures despite being little known outside specialized history he and his widow who became  after his death had a substantial impact on the subsequent development of judaism name dgrbm 
alexander jannaeus was the third son of john hyrcanus by his second wife when aristobulus i hyrcanus son by his first wife became king he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half brother aristobulus died after a reign of one year upon his death his widow  had alexander and his brothers released from prison name jehttp  jewishencyclopediacom articles 1144 alexander jannaeus jonathan alexander jannaeus jewish encyclopedia 
alexander as the oldest living brother had the right not only to the throne but also to salome the widow of his deceased brother who had died childless and although she was thirteen years older than he he married her by her he had two sons the eldest  became high priest in 62ampnbspbc and  who was high priest from 66   62ampnbspbc and started a bloody civil war with his brother ending in his capture by  
during the twenty seven year reign of alexander jannaeus he was almost constantly involved in military conflict international factors at the time created an environment suitable for jannaeus conquests first jannaeus received support from  this support was particularly crucial during the war with ptolemy lathyrus discussed later ultimately conflict in the  was the greatest outside influence on judean military campaigns political instability in rome led to a  beginning in 88ampnbspbc with rome chiefly concerned with a tumultuous domestic predicament jannaeus was free to expand the judean state
alexanders first expedition was against the  of ptolemais  this campaign seems to have been well timed politically as the weak  was unable to intervene help came to the citizens of ptolemais from  who had been cast out by his mother cleopatra iii and had founded a kingdom in 
ptolemy landed a large army for the relief of the town but alexander met him with treachery arranging an alliance with him openly while secretly he sought to obtain the help of his mother against him as soon as ptolemy learned of this intrigue he marched against  near sepphoris which he captured together with 10000 prisoners and much plunder a similar attack upon  failed but in a later battle at azophon on the jordan alexander with his whole army suffered a defeat at the hands of a much smaller force alexander allowed the enemy to cross the river unimpeded in order that as he thought he might more easily catch it between his army and the stream he saw his error only when it was too late the enemy fell upon the jewish camp women and children were struck down their corpses were hacked to pieces flung into caldrons and boiled so that the people thought they were dealing with cannibals this act was used to terrify the judean people and their military
alexander might easily have lost his crown and judea its independence as the result of this battle had it not been for the assistance extended by egypt cleopatras two jewish generals helkias and ananias persuaded the queen of the dangers of allowing her banished son ptolemy to remain victorious and she entrusted them with an army against him as a result ptolemy was forced to withdraw to cyprus and alexander was saved the egyptians as compensation for their aid desired to annex judea to their country but considerations touching the resident egyptian jews who were the main support of her throne induced cleopatra to modify her longings for conquest the egyptian army withdrawn alexander found his hands free and forthwith he planned new campaigns name je 
alexander captured  and the strong fortress  on the jordan but in an ambush set for him by theodorus ruler of amathus he lost the whole of the rear guard of his army—10000 men —together with his baggage he was more successful in his expedition against the hellenized coastal cities what had once been  capturing  and  finally in 96 bc  jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of  in a year long siege which he occupied through treachery and gave up to be pillaged and burned by his soldiery this victory gained judean control over the mediterranean outlet for the  trade routeshttp  wwwmfagovil mfa israelexperience history pages hasmonean rule extended to negev 10 dec 2009aspx hasmonean rule extended to negev highlands israel ministry of foreign affairs december 10 2009 
the relations between alexander and the pharisees were probably never very cordial though according to the statement of the talmud  the head of the party was a brother of the queen and a frequent guest at the palace name je 
the rival sadducees were avid supporters of jannaeus see 4q448 furthermore jannaeus established himself as a ruler concerned mainly with conquests rather than his religious obligations
one year during the jewish holiday of  alexander jannaeus while officiating as the  kohen gadol at the temple in jerusalem demonstrated his support of the  by using to perform the water  ceremony properly instead of pouring it on the altar he poured it on his feet the crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting alexander with the im s that they were holding in their hands unwittingly the crowd had played right into alexanders hands he had intended to incite the people to riot and his soldiers fell upon the crowd at his command the soldiers slew more than 6000 people in the temple courtyard
this incident during the feast of tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the judean civil war by igniting popular opponents of jannaeus a qumran document sheds further light on another opponent of jannaeus the scroll 4q390 was written by an adversary of jannaeus seeking popular support to overthrow the hasmonean king the author called for an end to the dispute between jannaeus and the pharisees according to the author the only acceptable solution was an end to the hasmonean priesthood and secular control this opposition culminated in the judean civil war
the judean civil war initially began after the conquest of gaza by jannaeus due to jannaeus victory at gaza the nabatean kingdom no longer controlled their main  to  theore nabatean king  launched an attack on judea in the  after jannaeus was defeated in battle against obodas he returned to fierce jewish opposition in jerusalem a civil war broke out between pharisee supported jewish rebels and jannaeus
overall the war lasted six years and left 50000 judeans dead after jannaeus succeeded early in the war the rebels asked for seleucid assistance judean insurgents joined forces with  to fight against jannaeus the seleucid forces defeated jannaeus at  and forced him to take uge in the mountains however these judean rebels ultimately decided that it was better to live under a terrible jewish king than backtrack to a seleucid ruler after 6000 jews returned to jannaeus demetrius was defeated the end of the civil war brought a sense of national solidarity against seleucid influence nevertheless jannaeus was uninterested in reconciliation within the judean state
the aftermath of the judean civil war consisted of popular unrest poverty and grief over the fallen soldiers on both sides the greatest impact of the war was the victors revenge josephus reports that jannaeus brought 800 rebels to jerusalem and had them crucified and had the throats of the rebels wives and children cut before their eyes as jannaeus ate with his concubines
the coinage of alexander jannaeus is characteristic of the early jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations in opposition to the surrounding greek and later roman types of the period jewish coinage instead focused on symbols either natural such as the  the  or the star or man made such as the  the  trumpets or 
alexander jannaeus was the first of the jewish kings to introduce the eight ray star or eight spoked wheel symbol in his  widows mite coins in combination with the widespread  numismatic symbol of the anchor depending on the make the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle in a style rather indicative of a wheel on others the spokes can have a more flame like shape more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem
it is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize and interpretations vary from the morning star to the sun or the heavens the influence of some n symbols of a star within a diadem or the eight spoked  wheel see the coins of the  king  with this symbol have also been suggested the eight spoked macedonian star a variation of which is the  emblem of the royal  and the ancient kingdom of ia within a hellenistic  symbolizing royalty many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem seem to be the most probable source for this symbol
the most likely explanation is that the symbol is a star encased in a diadem and it is a religious explanation biblical law forbids the making of graven images especially see deuteronomy 41623 yet the image of a monarch is a staple of hellenistic coins in place of an image of himself theore it is likely that alexander jannaeus chose a star in keeping with numbers 2417 a star rises from jacob a scepter comes forth from israel this verse generally was seen as a biblical support for monarchy and specifically as support for a davidic monarchy jannaeus however could have seen it as an image of his achievements if not his own rule this is how the rest of numbers 2417 and verses 18 and 19 continue the star it says smashes the brow of moab the foundation of all children of seth edom becomes a possession yea seir a possession of its enemies but israel is triumphant a victor issues from jacob to wipe out what is left of ir considering jannaeus conquests—creating a kingdom that rivaled those of david and solomon and may have even exceeded those—the star envisioned in the prophecy of balaam in numbers was a perfect match for him

the alexandrists were a school of  philosophers who in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality adopted the explanation of the de anima given by 
according to the orthodox  of the   rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul against this the averroists led by  introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again  these two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality or the absorption of the individual into the eternal one
the alexandrists led by  assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to aristotle  they held that aristotle considered the soul as a material and theore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason  hence the alexandrists denied the aristotle viewed the soul as immortal because in their view since they believed that aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former

alexios was the son of the   and  name kazhdan pg 63kazhdan pg 63  and the nephew of  emperor 1057–1059 alexios father declined the throne on the abdication of isaac who was thus succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081 under one of these emperors  1067–1071 alexios served with distinction against the  name norwich pg 4   under  parapinakes 1071–1078 and  1078–1081 he was also employed along with his elder brother  against rebels in   and in 
in 1074 western merchantmen led by  rebelled in asia minor name norwich pg 2norwich pg 2  but alexios successfully subdued them by 1076 name alexiad 11alexiad 11  in 1078 he was appointed commander of the field army in the west by nikephorosampnbspiii name norwich pg 3norwich pg 3  in this capacity alexios defeated the rebellions of  whose son or grandson later married alexios daughter anna and  the first at the  and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp name canduci pg 277canduci pg 277  alexios was ordered to march against his brother in law  in asia minor but used to fight his kinsman this did not however lead to a demotion as alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the  of southern italy led by 
while byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition the doukas faction at court approached alexios and convinced him to join a  against nikephorosampnbspiii the mother of alexios anna dalassena was to play a prominent role in this coup détat of 1081 along with the current empress  name garland anna dalassenagarland anna dalassena  first married to michaelampnbspvii doukas and secondly to  she was preoccupied with the future of her son by michaelampnbspvii  nikephorosampnbspiii intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives name finlay pg 59finlay pg 59  and this resulted in marias ambivalence and alliance with the komnenoi though the real driving force behind this political alliance was anna dalassenealexiad 221–2 
the empress was already closely connected to the komnenoi through marias cousin irene to isaac komnenos name finlay pg 59   so the komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit furthermore to aid the conspiracy maria had adopted alexios as her son though she was only five years older than he name norwich pg 5norwich pg 5  maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own alans and her eunuchs who had been instigated by isaac komnenos given annas tight hold on her family alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval name garland anna dalassena  as a result alexios and constantine marias son were now adoptive brothers and both isaac and alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperoralexiad 214–6 232–3234 cf bryennius 42 who dates the adoption to early in the reign of botaneiates  by secretly giving inside information to the komnenoi maria was an invaluable allyalexiad 234245 
as stated in the alexiad isaac and alexios left constantinople in mid february 1081 to raise an army against botaneiatesnorwich pg 6  however when the time came anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took uge in the  from there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital while protesting her sons innocence of hostile actions under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church she deliberately excluded the grandson of botaneiates and his loyal tutor met with alexios and isaac and fled for the forum of constantine name garland anna dalassena  the tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds but anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from  who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip however before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace name garland anna dalassena  anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives her sons were loyal subjects alexios and isaac were discovered absent without leave and had learned of a plot by enemies of the komnenoi to have them both blinded and had theore fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperoralexiad255  she used to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the mother of god for protection this request was granted and anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities
nikephorosampnbspiii botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family name garland anna dalassena  straboromanos tried to give anna his cross but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath she also demanded that the cross be personally sent by botaneiates as a vow of his good faith he obliged sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross at the emperors further insistence and for their own protection they took uge at the convent of petrion where they were eventually joined by  mother of irene doukaina name garland anna dalassena  botaneiates allowed them to be treated as ugees rather than as guests they were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest newsalexiad 257–9  anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city she distracted the emperor giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops and she gave a false sense of security to botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him name garland anna dalassena  after bribing the western troops guarding the city isaac and alexios komnenos entered the capital victoriously on april 1 1081finlay pg 63 
during this time alexios was rumored to be the lover of empress  the daughter of king  who had been successively married to  doukas and his successor nikephorosampnbspiii botaneiates and who was renowned for her beautynorwich pg 10  alexios arranged for maria to stay on the palace grounds and it was thought that he was considering marrying her however his mother consolidated the doukas family connection by arranging the emperors marriage to  granddaughter of the  the uncle of michaelampnbspvii who would not have supported alexios otherwise as a measure intended to keep the support of the doukai alexios restored  the young son of michaelampnbspvii and maria as co emperornorwich pg 12  and a little later betrothed him to his own first born daughter  who moved into the mangana palace with her fiancé and his mother
this situation changed drastically however when alexios first son  was born in 1087 name kazhdan pg 658kazhdan pg 658  annas engagement to constantine was dissolved and she was moved to the main palace to live with her mother and grandmother alexios became estranged from maria who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery and constantine doukas was deprived of his status as co emperor name kazhdan pg 658   nevertheless he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards
the nearly thirty seven year reign of alexios was full of struggle at the outset he faced the formidable attack of the normans led by  and his son  who took  and  and laid siege to  in  see  name canduci pg 277   alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success he enhanced his resistance by bribing the german king  with 360000 gold pieces to attack the normans in italynorwich pg 21  which forced the normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083–84 he also secured the alliance of  who controlled the  and dated his charters by alexios reign henrys allegiance would be the last example of byzantine political control on peninsular italy the norman danger subsided with the death of guiscard in 1085 and the byzantines recovered most of their lossesnorwich pg 25 
alexios next had to deal with disturbances in  where the heretical sects of the  and the  revolted and made common cause with the  from beyond the finlay pg 101  paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during alexios battles with the normansfinlay pg 78  as soon as the norman threat had passed alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters confiscating their lands this led to a further revolt near  and the commander of the field army in the west gregory pakourianos was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle in 1087 the pechenegs raided into thrace and alexios crossed into  to retaliate but failed to take dorostolon finlay pg 102  during his retreat the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the pechenegs who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money in 1090 the pechenegs invaded thrace againfinlay pg 104  while  the brother in law of the sultan of  launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of constantinople with the pechenegsnorwich pg 26  alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of 40000  with whose help he crushed the pechenegs at  in thrace on 29 april 1091norwich pg 27 
this put an end to the pecheneg threat but in 1094 the cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the balkans led by a pretender claiming to be constantine diogenes a long dead son of the emperor finlay pg 86  the cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern thrace until their leader was eliminated at  with the balkans more or less pacified alexios could now turn his attention to  which had been almost completely overrun by the finlay pg 108 
by the time alexios ascended the throne the seljuqs had taken most of asia minor alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the seljuq camps but these victories were unable to stop the turks altogetherfinlay pg 111  as early as 1090 alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the norwich pg 30  with the intention of seeking western support against the seljuqs in 1095 his ambassadors appeared before  at the  name canduci pg 279canduci pg 279  the help he sought from the west was simply some  forces not the immense hosts that arrived to his consternation and embarrassment after the pope preached the  at the  later that same yearnorwich pg 31  not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories the emperor saw his balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own alliesnorwich pg 33  alexios dealt with the first disorganized group of crusaders led by the preacher  by sending them on to asia minor where they were massacred by the turks in 1096 name kazhdan pg 1479kazhdan pg 1479 
the second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to  led in sections by    and other important members of the western nobilitynorwich pg 36  alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the finlay pg 123  transferring each contingent into asia alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage the crusade was a notable success for byzantium as alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands the  by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in 1097 and the subsequent crusader victory at  allowed the byzantine forces to recover much of western asia minor name norwich pg 42norwich pg 42   re established byzantine rule in      and  in 1097–1099 this success is ascribed by alexios daughter anna to his policy and diplomacy but by the latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception in 1099 a byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing  and other coastal towns as far as  the crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the byzantine contingent under  failed to help them during the  name canduci pg 279   bohemund who had set himself up as  name norwich pg 42   briefly went to war with alexios in the balkans but he was blockaded by the byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of alexios by the  in 1108norwich pg 48 
in 1116 though already terminally ill alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in bythinia and mysia to defend his anatolian territories against the inroads of  the seljuq sultan of iconium in 1117 he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the turkish dominated anatolian plateau where he defeated the seljuq sultan at the alexiad ed sewter pp 481 487 
during the last twenty years of his life alexios lost much of his popularitynorwich pg 54  the years were marked by persecution of the followers of the  and  heresiesfinlay pg 81 —one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake  a bogomil leader with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute name kazhdan pg 1479   in spite of the success of the crusade alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the seljuqs in 1110–1117norwich pg 58 
alexios was for many years under the strong influence of an eminence grise his mother  a wise and immensely able politician whom in a uniquely irregular fashion he had crowned as  instead of the rightful claimant to the title his wife irene doukainanorwich pg 59  dalassena was the effective administrator of the empire during alexios long absences in military campaigns she was constantly at odds with her daughter in law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter anna komnene

apart from all of his external enemies a host of rebels also sought to overthrow alexios from the imperial throne thereby posing another major threat to his reign name kazhdan pg 1479    due to the troubled times the empire was enduring he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the byzantine emperors name finlay pg 71finlay pg 71   these included

it was said he had a son called stephanus who also wrote comediessuda    he appears to have been rather addicted to the pleasures of the table according to  name dgrbm athenaeus deipnosophistae viii p 344 
he won his first  victory in the 350s bc most likely where he was sixth after  and fourth after   while being a middle comic poet alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of new comedy such as philippides   and even menander there is also some evidence that during his old age he wrote plays in the style of new comedy
 says that he lived to the age of 106 and 5 months and that he died on the stage while being crowned victor defect orac p 420 e  he was certainly alive after 345 bc for  mentions him as alive in that year he was also living at least as late as 288 bc name dgrbm  from which his birth date is calculated according to the  he wrote 245 comedies of which only fragments including some 130 titles survive his plays include meropis ankylion olympiodoros parasitos exhibited in 360 bc in which he ridiculed  agonis in which he ridiculed misgolas and the adelphoi and the stratiotes in which he satirized  and acted shortly after 343 bc
also hippeis 316 bc  in which he erred to the decree of  against the philosophers pyraunos 312 bc pharmakopole 306 bc  hypobolimaios 306 bc and ankylion name dgrbm

only fragments of any of the plays have survived   about 340 in all totaling about 1000 lines they attest to the wit and inement of the author which athenaeus praisesathenaeus ii p59 f   the surviving fragments also show that alexis invented a great deal of words mostly compound words that he used normal words in an unusual way and made strange and unusual forms of common words the main sources of the fragments of alexis are  and athenaeus

by 1190 alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother from whom he received the elevated title of  in 1195 while isaac ii was away hunting in  alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of alexios wife  alexios captured isaac at  in   and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner despite having previously been redeemed by alexios from captivity at  and showered with honours
to compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the empire practically defenceless these actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state at christmas 1196 holy roman emperor  attempted to force alexios to pay him a tribute of 5000 pounds later negotiated down to 1600 pounds of gold or face invasion alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the holy apostles and  though henrys death in september 1197 meant the gold was never dispatched the able and forceful empress euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court vatatzes the favourite instrument in her attempts at orm was  by the emperors orders
in the east the empire was overrun by the  from the north the  and the rebellious  and  descended unchecked to ravage the balkan provinces of the empire sometimes penetrating as far as greece while alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means the emperors attempts to bolster the empires defences by special concessions to rs notables in the frontier zone backfired as the latter increased their regional autonomy byzantine authority survived but in a much weakened state
soon alexios was threatened by a new and more formidable danger in 1202 soldiers assembled at  to launch the   the son of the deposed isaac ii had recently escaped from  and now appealed for support to the crusaders promising to end the  of  and  to pay for their transport and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his fathers throne
the crusaders whose objective had been  were persuaded to set their course for constantinople arriving there in june 1203 proclaiming alexios iv as emperor and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle alexios iii took no effective measures to resist and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed his son in law  who was the only one to attempt anything significant was defeated at  and the siege of constantinople began unfortunately for the city misgovernment by alexios iii had left the byzantine navy with only 20 worm eaten hulks by the time the crusaders arrived
in july the crusaders led by the aged   scaled the walls and took control of a major section of the city in the ensuing fighting the crusaders set the city on fire ultimately leaving 20000 people homeless  on 17 july alexios iii finally took action and led 17 divisions from the  vastly outnumbering the crusaders his courage failed however and the byzantine army returned to the city without a fight his courtiers demanded action and alexios iii promised to fight instead that night july 17 18 alexios iii hid in the palace and finally with one of his daughters eirene and such treasure 1000 pounds of gold as he could collect got into a boat and escaped to  in thrace leaving his wife and his other daughters behind isaac ii drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple received his son alexios iv in state

alexei petrovich romanov     was a n  he was born in  the son of tsar  and the tsars first wife 
the young alexei was brought up by his mother who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards  alexeis father alexeis relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mothers worst persecutor from the ages of 6 to 9 alexei was educated by his tutor vyazemsky but after the removal of his mother by peter the great to the  alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners who taught him history geography mathematics and french
in 1703 alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a  regiment in 1704 he was present at the capture of  at this period the preceptors of the tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability alexei had strong leanings towards  and  however peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new  and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain russias new wealth and power painful relations between father and son quite apart from the prior personal antipathies were theore inevitable it was an additional misfortune for alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood he was left in the hands of   and priests who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the tsar
in 1708 peter sent alexei to  to collect  and recruits and after that to  to fortify it against  at the end of 1709 alexei went to  for one year there he finished lessons in french german mathematics and fortification after his education alexei married albeit greatly against his will  whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of europe ie charlottes sister  was married to  ruler of the  in theory alexei could have used the marriage and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended why havent you written to tell me what you thought about her  wrote peter in a tone that can only be guessed in a letter dated  13 august 1710
the marriage contract was signed in september the wedding was celebrated at  the palace of the  on  14 october 1711 one of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the orthodox faith charlotte herself was allowed to retain her protestant faith an agreement that did not sit well at all with alexeis followers
as for the marriage itself it was a failure from the very start alexei pronounced his bride pock marked and too thin he insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public
three weeks later the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to  to superintend the provisioning of the russian troops in poland for the next twelve months alexei was kept constantly on the move his wife joined him at toruń in december but in april 1712 a peremptory  ordered him off to the army in  and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through

after the birth of natalia in 1714 alexei brought his long time finnish serf  farquhar michael 2001 a treasure of royal scandals p115 penguin books new york isbn 0 7394 2025 9  to live in the palace some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbases disapproval of his foreign non orthodox bride more so than her appearance that caused alexei to spurn charlotte another influence was  a high placed official who had fallen out with the tsar and had been deprived of his estates
immediately on his return from finland alexei was dispatched by his father to  and  to see to the building of new ships this was the last commission entrusted to him since peter had not been satisfied with his sons performance and his lack of enthusiasm nevertheless peter made one last effort to reclaim his son on  11 october 1715 charlotte died after giving birth to a son the grand duke peter future tsar  on the day of the funeral peter sent alexei a stern letter urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his fathers plans alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son peter peter would agree but on the condition that alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk
while alexei was pondering his options on 26 august 1716 peter wrote to alexei from abroad urging him if he desired to remain  to join him and the army without delay rather than face this ordeal alexei fled to  and placed himself under the protection of his brother in law the emperor  who sent him for safety first to the ean fortress of ehrenberg near  and finally to the castle of  at  he was accompanied throughout his journey by afrosinia that the emperor sincerely sympathized with alexei and suspected peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son is plain from his confidential letter to  whom he consulted on this delicate affair peter felt insulted the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal and he had to be recovered and brought back to russia at all costs this difficult task was accomplished by count  the most subtle and unscrupulous of peters servants
alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing that if he came back he should not be punished in the least but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry afrosinia
on 31 january 1718 the tsarevich reached moscow peter had already determined to institute a most searching  in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight on 18 february a confession was extorted from alexei which implicated most of his friends and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand duke peter petrovich a brutal reign of terror ensued in the course of which the ex tsaritsa eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged  while all who had in any way befriended alexei were  or  while having their flesh torn with red hot pincers or their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals and were otherwise lingeringly done to death all this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich
in april 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from and in regard to alexei this included the words of afrosinia who had turned states evidence i shall bring back the old people alexei is reported to have told her

when i become sovereign i shall live in moscow and leave saint petersburg simply as any other town i wont launch any ships i shall maintain troops only for defense and wont make war on anyone i shall be content with the old domains in winter i shall live in moscow and in summer in iaroslav blockquote
despite this and other hearsay evidence there were no facts to go upon the worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his fathers death in the eyes of peter his son was now a self convicted and most dangerous traitor whose life was forfeit but there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to russia the whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of s s  and other  on 13 june 1718 the  for their part declared the tsarevich alexei

at noon on 24 june the temporal dignitaries—the 126 members of both the senate and magistrates that comprised the court—declared alexei guilty and sentenced him to death but the examination by torture continued so desperate was peter to uncover any possible collusion
on 19 june the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty five strokes with the  and then on the 24th he was subject to fifteen more on 26 june alexei died in the  in  two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother in law the emperor

the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press which reached a low point when the press accused jacksons wife rachel of bigamy though the accusation was true as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign it was based on events that occurred many years prior 1791 to 1794 jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife rachel died suddenly on december 22 1828 before his inauguration and was buried on christmas eve he blamed the adams campaigners for her death may god almighty forgive her murderers he swore at her funeral i never can  jackson also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality he was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation workmark cheathem frontiersman or southern gentleman newspaper coverage of andrew jackson during the 1828 presidential campaign the readex report 2014 9#3 http  wwwreadexcom readex report frontiersman or southern gentleman newspaper coverage andrew jackson during 1828cmpid r140903 online
 
jacksons name has been associated with   or the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics   jacksons philosophy as president followed much in the same line as  advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generation   jacksons presidency held a high moralistic tone having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies a limited view of states rights and the federal government  jackson feared that monied and business interests would corrupt  when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession
jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics  instead of choosing party favorites jackson chose plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose  as secretary of state  secretary of war  secretary of treasury  secretary of navy  as attorney general and  as postmaster general  jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip especially between eaton vice president  and van buren  by the spring of 1831 only barry remained while the rest of jacksons cabinet had been discharged jacksons following cabinet selections worked better together

jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair   vicious washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president s wife  concerning secretary of war  and his wife  salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been quite generous with her favors petticoat politics  emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun used to socialize with the eatons jackson was outraged   male honor he firmly believed required husbands to control their wives allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but for jackson after losing his own wife to horrible rumors peggyss virtue could not be questioned  it was a matter of authority jackson told his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin   jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who questioned and dishonored jackson himselfwhen he defended the honor of peggy eaton jackson was also defending the honor of his recently deceased wife says  
meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian  notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement  the aristocratic wives of european diplomats shrugged the matter off they had their national interest to uphold and had seen how life worked in paris and london secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton daniel walker howe what hath god wrought 2007 pp 337 39 kirsten e wood one woman so dangerous to public morals gender and power in the eaton affair journal of the early republic 1997 237 275 http  wwwjstororg stable 3124447 in jstor 
the upshot was a total revamping of the cabinet with everyone resigning or being fired save the postmaster general jackson nominated van buren to be minister to england calhoun blocked the nomination calhoun continued to serve as vice president and boasted that van burens political career was over stating the defeated nomination would kill him sir kill dead he will never kick sir never kick  van buren however fully recovered and played a leading role in the jacksons unofficial  he became jacksons running mate in 1832 and his successor in 1836 jackson also acquired the globe newspaper to have his own propaganda weapon for fighting the rumor millsmeacham ppampnbsp171–75 
throughout his eight years in office jackson made about 70 treaties with native american tribes both in the  and the  jacksons presidency marked a new era in indian  american relations initiating a policy of indian removal  jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the     and the  the northwest tribes include the   and the  though conflict between indians and american settlers took place in the north and in the south the problem was worse in the south where the indian populations were larger indian wars broke out repeatedly often when native tribes especially the  and  indians used to abide by the treaties for various reasons the  started in december 1835 lasted over six years finally ending in august 1842 under president 
though relations between europeans and later americans and indians were always complicated they grew increasingly complicated once american settlements began pushing further west in the years after the  often these relations were peaceful though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent both on the part of american settlers and the indians from  to john quincy adams the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly though by jacksons time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable the problem was especially acute in the south in particular the lands near the state of  where indian populations were larger denser and more americanized than those of the north as such there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never one known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency this contrasted from his immediate predecessor president  who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention jacksons presidency thus took place in a new era in indian  american relations in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation as such during jacksons presidency indian relations between the southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture
in his december 8 1829 first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the  be set aside for indian tribes congress had been developing its own indian relocation bill and jackson had many supporters in both the senate and house who agreed with his goal on may 26 1830 congress passed the  and jackson signed it into law the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west outside of existing us state borders the passage of the bill was jacksons first successful legislative triumph and marked the democratic partys emergence into american political society the passage of the act was especially popular in the  where population growth and the discovery of gold on  land had increased pressure on tribal lands
the state of  became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the cherokees culminating in the 1832  decision  in that decision    in writing for the court ruled that georgia could not impose its laws upon cherokee tribal landsrobert v remini the life of andrew jackson 1988 p 216 cave 2003  jackson is frequently though incorrectly attributed with the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote originated in 1863 from  jackson used the georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty a group of cherokees led by  negotiated the  with jacksons representatives ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the  and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate  a group of cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal though this wasnt taken up by the supreme court or the us congress in part due to delays and timing name pbs jdir 
the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor van buren who sent 7000 troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began  it was subsequent to this that as many as 4000 cherokees died on the  by the 1830s under constant pressure from settlers each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands but sizable self government groups lived in georgia alabama mississippi and florida all of these except the seminoles had moved far in the coexistence with whites and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves their methods earned them the title of the  name pbs jdir   more than 45000 american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high  along the  and  border

in an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments  during jacksons tenure in office large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials jackson who believed appointees should be hired by merit withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies  jackson asked congress to orm embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with  who went on to implement much needed orms in the postal service 
jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the  by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president name firstaddress   in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the  giving the election of president and vice president to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress 
jacksons time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of 1832 for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need  while an act of july 1836 enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions 
upon assuming the presidency in 1829 jackson enforced the  passed earlier into law by president  in 1820 that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates  jackson believed that a  was actually a democratic orm preventing father to son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will  jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed name firstaddress  jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another  jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy opposed to this view however were jacksons supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members in practice this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyaliststhe  as the rotation in office system was called did not originate with jackson it originated with new york governors in the late 18th and early 19th centuries most notably  and   brought it to the  when he replaced federalist office holders after becoming president http  wwwu s historycom pages h965html the spoils system versus the merit system retrieved on november 21 2006  the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes  jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal democratic party followers by granting them federal office appointments jacksons democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me  
jacksons theory regarding rotation of office  generated what would later be called the  a practice that jackson ironically didnt justify  the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations name howe2007  historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics  supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency  during jacksons presidency those in opposition to jacksons purging of office holders formed the  calling jackson king andrew i having feared his military background and named their party after the english parliamentary whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy 
another notable crisis during jacksons period of office was the  or secession crisis of 1828–1832 which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs critics alleged that high tariffs the  on imports of common manufactured goods made in europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern us raising the prices paid by planters in the south southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers
the issue came to a head when vice president calhoun in the  of 1828 supported the claim of his home state  that it had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828 and more generally the right of a state to nullify any federal laws that went against its interests although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men
particularly notable was an incident at the april 13 1830 jefferson day dinner involving after dinner toasts  began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preservedampnbsp– a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dearogg 164 
at the  which was privately engineered by members of the kitchen cabinet calhoun and jackson broke from each other politically and van buren replaced calhoun as jacksons running mate in the  first published in 1860  in december 1832 calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina
in response to south carolinas nullification claim jackson vowed to send troops to  to enforce the laws in december 1832 he issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the  unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitutionampnbsp forms a government not a leagueampnbsp to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nationsyrett 36 see also  
jackson asked congress to pass a  explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until  led by clay agreed to a reduced  the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march 1 1833 and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance the force bill became moot because it was no longer needed on may 1 1833 jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and  and  the real object the next pretext will be the negro or  question 2009  new york random house p 247 correspondence of andrew jackson vol v p 72 
when jackson took office in 1829 spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and  governments  the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state  relations between the us and france were hopeless  jacksons minister to france  however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july 4 1831 that would award the us ₣ 25000000  5000000 in damages name cunningham_1999  the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king  and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies   by 1834 the non payment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in  jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for non payment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france   feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december 1835 state of the union address jackson used to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february 1836 american reparations were finally paid 
in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with   and   jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with     and  under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies   the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased 75% while imports increased 250% 
jackson however was unsuccessful in opening trade with  and   jackson was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for 5000000 failed  jacksons agent in texas colonel anthony butler suggested to take texas over militarily but jackson used butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency

during the  the rechartering of the second national bank became the primary issue  the election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period  the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore in may 1832 nominated jackson of tennessee and  of new york  the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december 1831 nominated  senator from  and former  and  of pennsylvania   the anti mason party who had earlier held their convention also in baltimore in september 1831 nominated  of maryland and amos elmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons  the two rival parties however proved to be no match for jacksons popularity and the democratic partys strong political networks known as hickory clubs in state and local organization   democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity   jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes   wirt received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the anti masonic party folded   jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy 
in 1833 jackson removed federal deposits from the bank whose money lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation  three years later jackson issued the  an  that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was a great demand for specie which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes causing the  which threw the national economy into a deep  it took years for the economy to recover from the damage but the bulk of the damage was blamed on  who took office in 1837w j rorabaugh donald t critchlow paula c baker 2004 https  booksgooglecom booksid vl_6x5zwookcamppg pa210ampdq pa349ampdqamphl en#v onepageampq ampf false americas promise a concise history of the united states rowman amp littlefield p210 isbn 0 7425 1189 8   notes

the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson jackson had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the  for  on may 6 1833 jackson sailed on uss cygnet to  where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of  s mother during a stopover near  randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the well known writer  jackson decided not to press charges name paletta 
on january 30 1835 what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the  when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of  representative   an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring name americanheritagecom  lawrence was restrained and legend says that jackson attacked lawrence with his cane others present including  restrained and disarmed lawrence
lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a erence to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically  dead since 1485—and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized
afterwards due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same  that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos
 
during the summer of 1835 controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819–1820  debates northern abolitionists were sending anti slavery tracts through the us postal system into the south  pro slavery southerners objected believing the tracts were incendiary literature and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti slavery tracts into the south on july 29 a pro slavery mob of 300 people led by former governor  broke into the post office in charleston south carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts the jackson administration had southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism however jackson who demanded sectional peace desired to placate southerners at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of northern democrats jacksons postmaster general  gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti slavery tracts jackson angrily denounced northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published jackson who wanted the matter quickly resolved also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers in february 1836 senator  jacksons former vice president authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti slavery tracts via the federal mail service the bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the house many southern postmasters however disregarded matters of federal law and simply used to send the anti slavery tracts
 
in the same year another controversy took place when abolitionists sent the us house of representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in washington dc this infuriated pro slavery southerners who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions on december 18 1835 south carolina congressman  strongly denounced abolitionists as ignorant fanatics northern whigs objected that anti slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden  jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly south carolina representative  drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as sickly sentimentality declared that congress had no right to interfere with slavery and tabled  all further anti slavery petitions jackson leaders in congress supported the measure which was passed quickly and without any debate temporarily suppressing pro abolitionist activities in congress
 
in 1835 pro slavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government by may 1836 they had routed the mexican military for the time being establishing an independent   the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant with recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an anti slavery issue during the 1836 election  the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact while democratic candidate van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a  on the last day of his presidency march 3 1837 
jackson initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office  the last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by  on the  jacksons predecessor  attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828 but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to  and the  jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second  term   on may 18 1836 jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic  jackson put secretary of navy  in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838 under the next president   one  ship  later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may 1836 circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the  confirming the existence of the  continent name usspo

brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper
observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his blood curling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record – in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings – listeners had to take his vows seriouslybrands p 297

johnson was born in poverty in  apprenticed as a tailor he worked in several frontier towns before settling in  he served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the  in 1835 after brief service in the  johnson was elected to the federal house of representatives in 1843 where he served five two year terms he became  for four years and was elected by the legislature to the senate in 1857 in his congressional service he sought passage of the  which was enacted soon after he left his senate seat in 1862
as  s including tennessee seceded to form the  johnson remained firmly with the union in 1862 lincoln appointed him as military governor of tennessee after it had been retaken in 1864 johnson as a  and  was a logical choice as  for lincoln who wished to send a message of national unity in his re election campaign their ticket easily won when johnson was sworn in as vice president in march 1865 he gave a rambling speech he later secluded himself to avoid public ridicule six weeks later the assassination of lincoln made him president
johnson implemented his own form of ampnbsp– a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re form their civil governments when southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed  to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties congress used to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the southern actions johnson vetoed their bills and congress overrode him setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidencyjohnson saw 15 of his vetoes overridden by congress   johnson opposed the  which gave citizenship to former slaves as the conflict between the branches of government grew congress passed the  restricting johnsons ability to fire cabinet officials when he persisted in trying to dismiss secretary of war  he was impeached by the house of representatives and narrowly avoided conviction in the senate and removal from office returning to tennessee after his presidency johnson sought political vindication and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the senate again in 1875 the only former president to serve there just months before his death although johnsons ranking has fluctuated over time he is generally considered  american presidents for his opposition to federally guaranteed rights for 
andrew johnson was born in  on december 29 1808 to  1778–1812 and mary polly mcdonough 1783–1856 a laundress his parents were of  and  ancestrypoles in united states by jan drohojowski krajowa agencja wydawnicza 1976 page 114  he had a brother william four years his senior and an older sister elizabeth who died in childhood johnsons having been born in a  was a political asset in the mid 19th century and johnson years later would frequently remind voters of his humble origins jacob johnson was a poor man as had been his father william johnson but he became town constable of raleigh before marrying and starting a family he died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell shortly after rescuing three drowning men when his son andrew was three polly johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family her occupation was then looked down on as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied there were even rumors that andrew who did not resemble his brother or sister had been fathered by another man polly johnson eventually remarried to turner doughtry who was as poor as she was
johnsons mother apprenticed her son william to a tailor james selby andrew also became an apprentice in selbys shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday johnson lived with his mother for part of his service and one of selbys employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills his education was augmented by citizens who would come to selbys shop to read to the tailors as they worked even before he became an apprentice johnson came to listen the readings caused a lifelong love of learning and one of his biographers  suggests that johnson later a gifted public speaker learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth
andrew johnson was not happy at james selbys and after about five years both he and his brother ran away selby responded by placing a reward for their return ten dollars reward ran away from the subscriber two apprentice boys legally bound named william and andrew johnsonampnbsp payment to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in raleigh or i will give the above reward for andrew johnson alone the brothers went to  where andrew johnson worked as a tailor for several months fearing he would be arrested and returned to raleigh johnson moved to  he found work quickly met his first love mary wood and made her a quilt as a gift however she rejected his marriage proposal  he returned to raleigh hoping to buy out his apprenticeship but could not come to terms with selby unable to stay in raleigh where he risked being apprehended for abandoning selby he decided to move west
johnson left north carolina for tennessee traveling mostly on foot after a brief period in  he moved to  he then worked as a tailor in  but was called back to raleigh by his mother and stepfather who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west johnson and his party traveled through the  to  andrew johnson fell in love with the town at first sight and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration
in greeneville johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home in 1827 at the age of 18 he married 16 year old  the daughter of a local shoemaker the pair were married by justice of the peace mordecai lincoln first cousin of  whose son would become president the johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children martha 1828 charles 1830 mary 1832 robert 1834 and andrew jr 1852 though she suffered from  eliza supported her husbands endeavors she taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing shy and retiring by nature eliza johnson usually remained in greeneville during johnsons political rise she was not often seen during her husbands presidency their daughter martha usually served as official hostess
johnsons tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate he later boasted of his talents as a tailor my work never ripped or gave way he was a voracious reader books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views he also took part in debates at 
johnson helped organize a mechanics working mens ticket in the 1829 greeneville municipal election he was elected town alderman along with his friends blackston mcdannel and mordecai lincoln following the 1831  a state convention was called to pass a new constitution including provisions to  free people of color the convention also wanted to orm real estate tax rates and provide ways of funding improvements to tennessees infrastructure the constitution was submitted for a public vote and johnson spoke widely for its adoption the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure on january 4 1834 his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of greeneville
in 1835 johnson made a bid for election to the floater seat which  shared with neighboring  in the  according to his biographer  johnson demolished the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin soon after taking his seat johnson purchased his first slave dolly aged 14 dolly had three children over the years johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly and the fact that dolly was dark skinned and her offspring much lighter led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father during his greeneville days johnson joined the  as a member of the 90th regiment he attained the rank of  though while an enrolled member johnson was fined for an unknown offense afterwards he was often addressed or erred to by his rank
in his first term in the legislature which met in the state capital of nashville johnson did not consistently vote with either the  or the newly formed  though he revered president  a democrat and tennessean the major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals with the party system in a state of flux the whig party had organized in opposition to jackson fearing the concentration of power in the executive branch of the government johnson differed from the whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation after  and the whigs defeated johnson for re election in 1837 johnson would not lose another race for thirty years in 1839 he sought to regain his seat initially as a whig but when another candidate sought the whig nomination he ran as a democrat and was elected from that time he supported the democratic party and built a powerful political machine in greene county johnson became a strong advocate of the democratic party noted for his oratory and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it people flocked to hear him
in 1840 johnson was selected as a presidential elector for tennessee giving him more statewide publicity although democratic president  was defeated by former ohio senator  johnson was instrumental in keeping tennessee and greene county in the democratic column he was elected to the  in 1841 where he served a two year term name congbio  he had achieved financial success in his tailoring business but sold it to concentrate on politics he had also acquired additional real estate including a larger home and a farm where his mother and stepfather took residence and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves
having served in both houses of the legislature johnson saw election to congress as the next step in his political career he engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain democratic support including the displacement of the whig postmaster in greeneville and defeated  lawyer john a aiken by 5495 votes to 4892 in washington he joined a new democratic majority in the house of representatives johnson advocated for the interests of the poor maintained an anti  stance argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs with eliza remaining in greeneville congressman johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the  although a fellow tennessee democrat   in 1844 and johnson had campaigned for him the two men had difficult relations and president polk used some of his patronage suggestions
johnson believed as did many southern democrats that the constitution protected private property including slaves and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery he won a second term in 1845 against  presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy in his second term johnson supported the polk administrations decision to fight the  seen by some northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward and opposed the  a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from mexico he introduced for the first time his homestead bill to grant  to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it this issue was especially important to johnson because of his own humble beginnings
in the  the democrats split over the slavery issue and abolitionists formed the  with former president van buren as their nominee johnson supported the democratic candidate former michigan senator  with the party split whig nominee general  was easily victorious and carried tennessee johnsons relations with polk remained poor the president recorded of his final new years reception in 1849 that
johnson due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district also supported government assistance for the 
in his campaign for a fourth term johnson concentrated on three issues slavery homesteads and judicial elections he defeated his opponent  in august 1849 with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns when the house convened in december the party division caused by the free soil party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a speaker johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a speaker by a plurality some weeks later others took up a similar proposal and democrat  was elected
once the speaker election had concluded and congress was ready to conduct legislative business the issue of slavery took center stage northerners sought to admit california a free state to the union kentuckys  introduced in the senate a series of resolutions the  to admit california and pass legislation sought by each side johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nations capital he pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators then elected by state legislatures and of the president chosen by the  and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years these were all defeated
a group of democrats nominated  to oppose johnson as he sought a fifth term the whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own the campaign included fierce debates johnsons main issue was the passage of the homestead bill haynes contended it would facilitate abolition johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes though he was not enamored of the partys presidential nominee in 1852 former new hampshire senator  johnson campaigned for him pierce was elected but he failed to carry tennessee in 1852 johnson managed to get the house to pass his homestead bill but it failed in the senate the whigs had gained control of the tennessee legislature and under the leadership of  redrew the boundaries of johnsons first district to make it a safe seat for their party the nashville union termed this henry mandering lamented johnson i have no political future
if johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek re election he soon changed his mind the congressmans political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor the democratic convention unanimously named him though some party members were not happy at his selection the whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections and still controlled the legislature that party nominated henry making the henry mandering of the first district an immediate issue the two men debated in county seats the length of tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the august 1853 election due to illness in henrys family johnson won the election by 63413 votes to 61163 some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support whig  for his old seat in congress
tennessees governor had little power—johnson could propose legislation but not veto it and most appointments were made by the whig controlled legislature nevertheless the office was a  that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views he succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of  a whig for one of the states us senate seats in his first biennial speech johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system abolishment of the bank of tennessee and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures the last was passed johnson was critical of the tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes either statewide or county by county—a mixture of the two was passed reforms carried out during johnsons time as governor included the foundation of the states public library making books available to all and its first public school system and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers 
although the whig party was on its final decline nationally it remained strong in tennessee and the outlook for democrats there in 1855 was poor feeling that re election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought johnson agreed to make the run  received the whig nomination a series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued the issues in the campaign were slavery the prohibition of alcohol and the  positions of the  johnson favored the first but opposed the others gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question and had gained the support of the know nothings a group johnson portrayed as a secret society johnson was unexpectedly victorious albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853
when the presidential election of 1856 approached johnson hoped to be nominated some tennessee county conventions designated him a  his position that the best interests of the union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president he was never a major contender the nomination fell to former pennsylvania senator  though he was not impressed by either johnson campaigned for buchanan and his running mate  who were elected
johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor with an eye towards election to the us senate in 1857 while returning from washington his train derailed causing serious damage to his right arm this injury would trouble him in the years to come
 
the victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would once they convened in october elect a united states senator former whig governor  wrote to his uncle the great anxiety of the whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat andrew johnson for senator should the democrats have the majority he will certainly be their choice and there is no man living to whom the americans and whigs have as much antipathy as johnson the governor spoke widely in the campaign and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature johnsons final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors and he made proposals popular among democrats two days later the legislature elected him to the senate the opposition was appalled with the richmond whig newspaper erring to him as the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the union
johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self employed tradesmen who made up much of tennessees electorate he called them the plebians he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state democratic party but none could match him as a vote getter after his death one tennessee voter wrote of him johnson was always the same to everyoneampnbsp the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen always seen in impeccably tailored clothing he cut an impressive figure and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate mostly denied the partys machinery he relied on a network of friends advisers and contacts one friend hugh douglas stated in a letter to him you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time at heart many of us never wanted you to be governor only none of the rest of us could   capitalization as in original    have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you then we did not want you to go to the senate but the people would send you
the new senator took his seat when congress convened in december 1857 the term of his predecessor  had expired in march he came to washington as usual without his wife and family eliza would visit washington only once during johnsons first time as senator in 1860 johnson immediately set about introducing the homestead bill in the senate but as most senators who supported it were northern many associated with the newly founded  the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the homestead bill were more likely to be northern non slaveholders the issue of slavery had been complicated by the supreme courts ruling earlier in the year in  that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories johnson a slaveholding senator from a southern state made a major speech in the senate the following may in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the homestead bill and slavery were not incompatible nevertheless southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation 30–22 in 1859 it failed on a procedural vote when vice president breckinridge broke a tie against the bill and in 1860 a watered down version passed both houses only to be vetoed by buchanan at the urging of southerners johnson continued his opposition to spending chairing a committee to control it
he argued against funding to build washington dcs infrastructure stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the citys streets even if it was the seat of government he opposed spending money for troops to put down  by the mormons in  arguing for temporary volunteers as the united states should not have a standing army
 
in october 1859 abolitionist  and sympathizers  at  virginia today west virginia tensions in washington between pro  and anti slavery forces increased greatly johnson gave a major speech in the senate in december decrying northerners who would endanger the union by seeking to outlaw slavery the tennessee senator stated that all men are created equal from the  did not apply to african americans since the  contained that phrase—and that document barred voting by african americans
johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the democratic party tore itself apart over the slavery question busy with the homestead bill during the  in  he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom dealmaking the convention deadlocked with no candidate able to gain the required two thirds vote but the sides were too far apart to consider johnson as a compromise the party split with northerners backing illinois senator  while southerners including johnson supported vice president breckinridge for president with former tennessee senator  running a fourth party candidacy and further dividing the vote the republican party elected its first president former illinois representative   known to be against the spread of slavery was unacceptable to many in the south although secession from the union had not been an issue in the campaign talk of it began in the southern states
johnson took to the senate floor after the election giving a speech well received in the north i will not give up this governmentampnbsp no   punct as in original    i intend to stand by itampnbsp and i invite every man who is a patriot toampnbsp rally around the altar of our common countryampnbsp and swear by our god and all that is sacred and holy that the constitution shall be saved and the union preserved as southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded he reminded mississippi senator  that if southerners would only hold to their seats the democrats would control the senate and could defend the souths interests against any infringement by lincoln gordon reed points out that while johnsons belief in an indissoluble union was sincere he had alienated southern leaders including davis who would soon be  of the  formed by the seceding states if the tennessean had backed the confederacy he would have had small influence in its government
johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession his successor as governor  and the legislature organized a erendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession when that failed they put the question of leaving the union to a popular vote despite threats on johnsons life and actual assaults he campaigned against both questions sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him although johnsons  was largely against secession the second erendum passed and in june 1861 tennessee joined the confederacy believing he would be killed if he stayed johnson fled through the  where his party was in fact shot at he left his wife and family in greeneville
as the only member from a seceded state to remain in the senate and the most prominent  johnson had lincolns ear in the early months of the war with most of tennessee in confederate hands johnson spent congressional recesses in kentucky and ohio trying in vain to convince any union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into east tennessee
   this section is linked to from    
johnsons first tenure in the senate came to a conclusion in march 1862 when lincoln appointed him military governor of tennessee much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the confederates were defeated in an area lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over union controlled southern regions the senate quickly confirmed johnsons nomination along with the rank of  in response the confederates confiscated his land and his slaves and turned his home into a military hospital later in 1862 after his departure from the senate and in the absence of most southern legislators the  was finally enacted along with legislation for s and for the  the homestead bill has been credited with opening the american west to settlement
as military governor johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state he demanded loyalty oaths from public officials and shut down all newspapers owned by confederate sympathizers much of eastern tennessee remained in confederate hands and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought confederate control again close to nashville however the confederate allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him johnson undertook the defense of nashville as best he could though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by general  relief from union regulars did not come until  defeated the confederates at  in early 1863 much of eastern tennessee was captured later that year
when lincoln issued the  in january 1863 declaring freedom for all slaves in confederate held areas he exempted tennessee at johnsons request the proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war as not all unionists supported abolition johnson finally decided that slavery had to end he wrote if the institution of slaveryampnbsp seeks to overthrow it the government then the government has a clear right to destroy it he reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the union army feeling that african americans should perform menial tasks to release white americans to do the fighting nevertheless he succeeded in recruiting 20000 black soldiers to serve the union
in 1860 lincolns running mate had been maine senator  vice president hamlin had served competently was in good health and was willing to run nevertheless johnson emerged as running mate for lincolns re election bid in 1864
lincoln considered several  for the ticket in 1864 and sent an agent to sound out general  as a possible running mate in may 1864 the president dispatched general  to nashville on a fact finding mission although sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor johnson biographer hans l tousse believes sickless trip was connected to johnsons subsequent nomination for vice president according to historian albert castel in his account of johnsons presidency lincoln was impressed by johnsons administration of tennessee gordon reed points out that while the lincoln hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860 having johnson the southern war democrat on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country another factor was the desire of secretary of state  to frustrate the vice presidential candidacy of his fellow new yorker former senator  a war democrat as seward would probably have had to yield his place if another new yorker became vice president johnson once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of sickles visit was active on his own behalf giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy
to sound a theme of unity lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the  rather than the republicans at  in baltimore in june lincoln was easily nominated although there had been some talk of replacing him with a cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals after the convention backed lincoln former secretary of war  offered a resolution to nominate hamlin but it was defeated johnson was nominated for vice president by cm allen of indiana with an iowa delegate as seconder on the first ballot johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for hamlin and 108 for dickinson on the second ballot kentucky switched to vote for johnson beginning a stampede johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to hamlins 17 and eight for dickinson the nomination was made unanimous lincoln expressed pleasure at the result andy johnson i think is a good man when word reached nashville a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the union
although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign johnson gave a number of speeches in tennessee kentucky ohio and indiana he also sought to boost his chances in tennessee while re establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the confederacy the democratic candidate for president  hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters lincoln declined to override johnson and their ticket took the state by 25000 votes congress used to count tennessees electoral votes but lincoln and johnson did not need them having won in most states that had voted and easily secured the election
now vice president elect johnson was anxious to complete the work of re establishing civilian government in tennessee although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after inauguration day march 4 he hoped to remain in nashville to complete his task but was told by lincolns advisers that he could not stay but would be sworn in with lincoln in these months union troops finished the retaking of eastern tennessee including greeneville just before his departure the voters of tennessee ratified a new constitution abolishing slavery on february 22 1865 one of johnsons final acts as military governor was to certify the results
johnson traveled to washington to be sworn in although according to gordon reed in light of what happened on march 4 1865 it might have been better if johnson had stayed in nashville he may have been ill castel cited typhoid fever though gordon reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis on the evening of march 3 johnson attended a party in his honor he drank heavily hung over the following morning at the capitol he asked vice president hamlin for some whiskey hamlin produced a bottle and johnson took two stiff drinks stating i need all the strength for the occasion i can have in the senate chamber johnson delivered a rambling address as lincoln the congress and dignitaries looked on almost incoherent at times he finally meandered to a halt whereupon hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president lincoln who had watched sadly during the debacle was sworn in and delivered his acclaimed 
in the weeks after the inauguration johnson only presided over the senate briefly and hid from public ridicule at the maryland home of a friend  when he did return to washington it was with the intent of leaving for tennessee to re establish his family in greeneville instead he remained after word came that general  had captured the confederate capital of  presaging the end of the war lincoln stated in response to criticism of johnsons behavior that i have known andy johnson for many years he made a bad slip the other day but you need not be scared andy aint a drunkard
on the afternoon of april 14 1865 lincoln and johnson met for the first time since the inauguration tousse states that johnson wanted to induce lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors gordon reed agrees
that night president lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by  a confederate sympathizer the shooting of the president was part of a conspiracy to assassinate lincoln johnson and seward the same night seward barely survived his wounds while johnson escaped attack as his would be assassin  got drunk instead of killing the vice president  a fellow boarder at the kirkwood house awoke johnson with news of lincolns shooting at  johnson rushed to the presidents deathbed where he remained a short time on his return promising they shall suffer for this they shall suffer for this lincoln died at 722ampnbspam the next morning johnsons swearing in occurred between 10 and 11ampnbspam with chief justice  presiding in the presence of most of the cabinet johnsons demeanor was described by the newspapers as solemn and dignified some cabinet members had last seen johnson apparently drunk at the inauguration at noon johnson conducted his first cabinet meeting in the treasury secretarys office and asked all members to remain in their positions
the events of the assassination resulted in speculation then and subsequently concerning johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him in the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of johnson was merely a ruse conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination booth came to the kirkwood house and left one of his cards this object was received by johnsons private secretary william a browning with an inscription are you at home dont wish to disturb you j wilkes booth
johnson presided with dignity over lincolns funeral ceremonies in washington before his predecessors body was sent home to  for burial shortly after lincolns death union general  reported he had without consulting washington reached an armistice agreement with confederate general  for the surrender of confederate forces in north carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power with private property rights to be respected this did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery this was not acceptable to johnson or the cabinet who sent word for sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals which he did further johnson placed a 100000 bounty equivalent to  million in  on confederate president davis then a fugitive which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the south more controversially he permitted the execution of  for her part in lincolns assassination surratt was executed with three others including atzerodt on july 7 1865
 
upon taking office johnson faced the question of what to do with the confederacy president lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in virginia arkansas louisiana and tennessee as the union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a  that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the union congress considered this too lenient  requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath passed both houses in 1864 but lincoln ed it
johnson had three goals in reconstruction he sought a speedy restoration of the states on the grounds that they had never truly left the union and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government to johnson african american suffrage was a delay and a distraction it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote second political power in the southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved plebians johnson feared that the freedmen many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters might vote at their direction johnsons third priority was election in his own right in 1868 a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish
the republicans had formed a number of factions the s sought voting and other civil rights for african americans they believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote republican in gratitude for emancipation and that black votes could keep the republicans in power and southern democrats including former rebels out of influence they believed that top confederates should be punished the moderate republicans sought to keep the democrats out of power at a national level and prevent former rebels from resuming power they were not as enthusiastic about the idea of african american suffrage as their radical colleagues either because of their own local political concerns or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly northern democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the southern states they did not support african american suffrage which might threaten democratic control in the south
 
johnson was initially left to devise a reconstruction policy without legislative intervention as congress was not due to meet again until december 1865 radical republicans told the president that the southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the union but johnson with the support of other officials including seward insisted that the franchise was a state not a federal matter the cabinet was divided on the issue
johnsons first reconstruction actions were two proclamations with the unanimous backing of his cabinet on may 29 one recognized the virginia government led by provisional governor  the second provided amnesty for all ex rebels except those holding property valued at 20000 or more it also appointed a temporary governor for north carolina and authorized elections neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding  or freedmens rights the president ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states
as southern states began the process of forming governments johnsons policies received considerable public support in the north which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the south while he received such support from the white south he underestimated the determination of northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing it was important in northern public opinion that the south acknowledge its defeat that slavery be ended and that the lot of african americans be improved voting rights were less important—after all only a handful of northern states mostly in new england gave african american men the right to vote on the same basis as whites and in late 1865 connecticut wisconsin and minnesota voted down african american suffrage proposals by large margins northern public opinion tolerated johnsons inaction on black suffrage as an experiment to be allowed if it quickened southern acceptance of defeat instead white southerners felt emboldened a number of southern states passed  binding african american laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor most southerners elected to congress were former confederates with the most prominent being georgia senator designate and former confederate vice president  congress assembled in early december 1865 johnsons conciliatory  to them was well received nevertheless congress used to seat the southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate reconstruction legislation
northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant confederate leaders such as stephens rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw they saw the black codes placing african americans in a position barely above slavery republicans also feared that restoration of the southern states would return the democrats to power in addition according to  in his book on johnsons impeachment the violence and poverty that oppressed the south would galvanize the opposition to johnson
 
congress was reluctant to confront the president and initially only sought to fine tune johnsons policies towards the south according to tousse if there was a time when johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the republican party it was the period following the return of congress the president was unhappy about the provocative actions of the southern states and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there but made no statement publicly believing that southerners had a right to act as they did even if it was unwise to do so by late january 1866 he was convinced that winning a showdown with the radical republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of reconstruction and for re election in 1868 he would have perred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise african americans in the district of columbia a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all white erendum a bill to accomplish this passed the house of representatives but to johnsons disappointment stalled in the senate before he could veto it
illinois senator  leader of the moderate republicans and chairman of the judiciary committee was anxious to reach an understanding with the president he ushered through congress a bill extending the  beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867 and the first civil rights bill to grant citizenship to the freedmen trumbull met several times with johnson and was convinced the president would sign the measures johnson rarely contradicted visitors often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord in fact the president opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty additionally both of trumbulls bills were unpopular among white southerners whom johnson hoped to include in his new party johnson vetoed the freedmans bureau bill on february 18 1866 to the delight of white southerners and the puzzled anger of republican legislators he considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the senate the following day johnson believed that the radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate republicans would form behind him he did not understand that moderates too wanted to see african americans treated fairly
on february 22 1866  johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the  and called for an address in honor of  in his hour long speech he instead erred to himself over 200 times more damagingly he also spoke of menampnbsp still opposed to the union to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the south when called upon by the crowd to say who they were johnson named pennsylvania congressman  massachusetts senator  and abolitionist  and accused them of plotting his assassination republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war while one democratic ally estimated johnsons speech cost the party 200000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections
although strongly urged by moderates to sign the  johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on march 27 in his veto message he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the congress and that it discriminated in favor of african americans and against whites within three weeks congress had overridden his veto the first time that had been done on a major bill in american history the veto of the  often seen as a key mistake of johnsons presidency convinced moderates there was no hope of working with him historian  in his volume on reconstruction views it as the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career according to stewart the veto was for many his defining blunder setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency
congress also proposed the  to the states written by trumbull and others it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part though johnson opposed it the amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the civil rights act into the constitution but also went further the amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the united states except indians on reservations penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen and most importantly created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts it also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of confederate war debts further it disqualified many former confederates from office although the disability could be removed—by congress not the president both houses passed the freedmens bureau act a second time and again the president vetoed it this time the veto was overridden by the summer of 1866 when congress finally adjourned johnsons method of restoring states to the union by executive fiat without safeguards for the freedmen was in deep trouble his home state of tennessee ratified the fourteenth amendment despite the presidents opposition when tennessee did so congress immediately seated its proposed delegation embarrassing johnson
efforts to compromise failed and a political war ensued between the united republicans on one side and on the other johnson and his allies in the democratic party north and south he called a convention of the national union party republicans had returned to using their previous identifier johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term in 1868 the battleground was the  southern states were not allowed to vote johnson campaigned vigorously undertaking a public speaking tour known as the  the trip including speeches in chicago st louis indianapolis and columbus proved politically disastrous with the president making controversial comparisons between himself and christ and engaging in arguments with hecklers these exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency the republicans won by a landslide increasing their two thirds majority in congress and made plans to control reconstruction johnson blamed the democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the national union movement
 
even with the republican victory in november 1866 johnson considered himself in a strong position the fourteenth amendment had been ratified by none of the southern or  except tennessee and had been rejected in kentucky delaware and maryland as the amendment required ratification by three quarters of the states to become part of the constitution he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor leading to his election in 1868 once it reconvened in december 1866 an energized congress began passing legislation often over a presidential veto this included the district of columbia voting bill congress admitted nebraska to the union over a veto and the republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment johnsons veto of a bill for statehood for  was sustained enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day
in january 1867 congressman stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts under  the states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions african americans could vote for or become delegates former confederates could not in the legislative process congress added to the bill that restoration to the union would follow the states ratification of the fourteenth amendment and completion of the process of adding it to the constitution johnson and the southerners attempted a compromise whereby the south would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former confederates and for limited black suffrage the republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment and the deal fell through although johnson could have pocket vetoed the  as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the thirty ninth congress he chose to veto it directly on march 2 1867 congress overruled him the same day also on march 2 congress passed the  over the presidents veto in response to statements during the swing around the circle that he planned to fire cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him this bill requiring senate approval for the firing of cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards was immediately controversial with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to johnson whose key cabinet officers were lincoln holdovers
secretary of war  was an able and hard working man but difficult to deal with johnson both admired and was exasperated by his war secretary who in combination with  grant worked to undermine the presidents southern policy from within his own administration johnson considered firing stanton but respected him for his wartime service as secretary stanton for his part feared allowing johnson to appoint his successor and used to resign despite his public disagreements with his president
the new congress met for a few weeks in march 1867 then adjourned leaving the house committee on the judiciary behind charged with reporting back to the full house whether there were grounds for johnson to be impeached this committee duly met examining the presidents bank accounts and summoning members of the cabinet to testify when a federal court released former confederate president davis on bail on may 13 he had been captured shortly after the war the committee investigated whether the president had impeded the prosecution it learned that johnson was eager to have davis tried a bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges the committee adjourned on june 3
later in june johnson and stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the south could override the civil authorities the president had attorney general  issue an opinion backing his position that they could not johnson sought to pin down stanton either as for and thus endorsing johnsons position or against showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the cabinet stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications when congress reconvened in july it passed a reconstruction act against johnsons position waited for his veto overruled it and went home in addition to clarifying the powers of the generals the legislation also deprived the president of control over the army in the south with congress in recess until november johnson decided to fire stanton and relieve one of the military commanders general  who had dismissed the governor of texas and installed a replacement with little popular support he was initially deterred by a strong objection from grant on august 5 the president demanded stantons resignation the secretary used to quit with congress out of session johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of congress as permitted under the tenure of office act grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the army
grant under protest followed johnsons order transferring sheridan and another of the district commanders  who had angered johnson by firmly following congresss plan the president also issued a proclamation pardoning most confederates exempting those who held office under the confederacy or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths although republicans expressed anger with his actions the 1867 elections generally went democratic no seats in congress were directly elected in the polling but the democrats took control of the  allowing them to defeat for re election one of johnsons strongest opponents senator  voters in ohio connecticut and minnesota turned down propositions to grant african americans the vote the adverse results momentarily put a stop to republican calls to impeach johnson who was elated by the elections nevertheless once congress met in november the judiciary committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against johnson after much debate about whether anything the president had done was a high crime or misdemeanor the standard under the constitution the resolution was defeated by the house of representatives on december 7 1867 by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed
johnson notified congress of stantons suspension and grants interim appointment in january 1868 the senate disapproved of his action and reinstated stanton contending the president had violated the tenure of office act grant stepped aside over johnsons objection causing a complete break between them johnson then dismissed stanton and appointed  to replace him stanton used to leave his office and on february 24 1868 the house impeached the president for intentionally violating the tenure of office act by a vote of 128 to 47 the house subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment for the most part alleging that he had violated the tenure of office act and had questioned the legitimacy of congress
on march 5 1868 the impeachment trial began in the senate and lasted almost three months congressmen  benjamin butler and thaddeus stevens acted as managers for the house or prosecutors and   and former attorney general stanbery were johnsons counsel chief justice chase served as presiding judge the defense relied on the provision of the tenure of office act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration since lincoln had appointed stanton the defense maintained johnson had not violated the act and also argued that the president had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of congress johnsons counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial nor publicly comment about the proceedings and except for a pair of interviews in april he complied
johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal for example he pledged to iowa senator  that he would not interfere with congresss reconstruction efforts grimes reported to a group of moderates many of whom voted for acquittal that he believed the president would keep his word johnson also promised to install the respected  as war secretary  kansas senator  received assurances that the new radical influenced constitutions ratified in south carolina and arkansas would be transmitted to the congress without delay an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal one reason senators were reluctant to remove the president was that his successor would have been ohio senator wade the  of the senate wade a  who left office in early 1869 was a radical who supported such measures as womens suffrage placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation additionally a president wade was seen as an obstacle to grants ambitions
with the dealmaking johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict and in the days leading up to the ballot newspapers reported that stevens and his radicals had given up on may 16 the senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment accusing johnson of firing stanton in violation of the tenure of office of act once the senate had overturned his suspension thirty five senators voted guilty and 19 not guilty thus falling short by a single vote of the two thirds majority required for conviction under the constitution seven republicans—senators grimes ross trumbull    and —voted to acquit the president with stevens bitterly disappointed at the result the senate then adjourned for the  grant was nominated for president the senate returned on may 26 and voted on the second and third articles with identical 35–19 results faced with those results johnsons opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings stanton relinquished his office on may 26 and the senate subsequently confirmed schofield when johnson renominated stanbery to return to his position as attorney general after his service as a defense manager the senate used to confirm him
allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial even when it was in progress representative butler began an investigation held contentious hearings and issued a report unendorsed by any other congressman butler focused on a new york–based astor house group supposedly led by  and editor  this organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through cincinnati lawyer charles woolley to bribe senators to acquit johnson butler went so far as to imprison woolley in the capitol building    a committee room and then an artists studio    when he used to answer questions but failed to prove bribery
soon after taking office as president johnson reached an accord with secretary of state  that there would be no change in foreign policy in practice this meant that seward would continue to run things as he had under lincoln seward and lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860 the victor hoped that seward would succeed him as president in 1869 at the time of johnsons accession  sending troops there while many politicians had indulged in  over the mexican matter seward perred quiet diplomacy warning the french through diplomatic channels that their presence in mexico was not acceptable although the president perred a more aggressive approach seward persuaded him to follow his lead in april 1866 the french government informed seward that its troops would be brought home in stages to conclude by november 1867
seward was an expansionist and sought opportunities to gain territory for the united states by 1867 the russian government saw its  today alaska as a financial liability and feared losing control as american settlement reached there it instructed its minister in washington baron  to negotiate a sale de stoeckl did so deftly getting seward to raise his offer from 5 million coincidentally the minimum that russia had instructed de stoeckl to accept to 7 million and then getting 200000 added by raising various objections this sum of 72 million is equivalent to  in present day terms on march 30 1867 de stoeckl and seward signed the treaty working quickly as the senate was about to adjourn johnson and seward took the signed document to the presidents room in the capitol only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment the president summoned the senate into session to meet on april 1 that body approved the treaty 37–2 emboldened by his success in alaska seward sought acquisitions elsewhere his only success was staking an american claim to uninhabited  in the pacific which would be officially claimed by the us  he came close with the  as denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite but the senate never voted on the treaty and it expired 
another treaty that fared badly was the johnson clarendon convention negotiated in settlement of the  for damages to american shipping from british built confederate raiders negotiated by the  former maryland senator  in late 1868 it was ignored by the senate during the remainder of the presidents term the treaty was rejected after he left office and the grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from britain
 
johnson appointed nine article iii federal judges during his presidency all to s he did not appoint a justice to serve on the  in april 1866 he nominated  to fill the vacancy left with the death of  but congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office johnson appointed his greeneville crony  to the  where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874
johnson sought nomination by the  in new york in july 1868 he remained very popular among southern whites and boosted that popularity by issuing just before the convention a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any confederate not already indicted meaning that only davis and a few others still might face trial on the first ballot johnson was second to former ohio representative  who had been his democratic opponent for vice president in 1864 johnsons support was mostly from the south and fell away as the ballots passed on the 22nd ballot former new york governor  was nominated and the president received only four votes all from tennessee
the conflict with congress continued johnson sent congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six year term and make the president and the senate directly elected and for term limits for judges congress took no action on them when the president was slow to officially report ratifications of the fourteenth amendment by the new southern legislatures congress passed a bill again over his veto requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt he still delayed as much as he could but was required in july 1868 to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the constitution
seymours operatives sought johnsons support but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign it was not until october with the vote already having taken place in some states that he mentioned seymour at all and he never endorsed him nevertheless johnson regretted grants victory in part because of their animus from the stanton affair in his annual message to congress in december johnson urged the repeal of the tenure of office act and told legislators that had they admitted their southern colleagues in 1865 all would have been well he celebrated his 60th birthday in late december with a party for several hundred children though not including those of  grant who did not allow his to go
on christmas day 1868 johnson issued a final amnesty this one covering everyone including davis he also issued in his final months in office pardons for crimes including one for dr  controversially convicted of involvement in the lincoln assassination he had set booths broken leg and imprisoned in  on floridas 
on march 3 the president hosted a large public reception at the white house on his final full day in office grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as johnson as was customary and johnson used to go to the inauguration at all despite an effort by seward to prompt a change of mind he spent the morning of march 4 finishing last minute business and then shortly after noon rode from the white house to the home of a friend
after leaving the presidency johnson remained for some weeks in washington then returned to greeneville for the first time in eight years he was honored with large public celebrations along the way especially in tennessee where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners he had arranged to purchase a large farm near greeneville to live on after his presidency
some expected johnson to seek to be tennessees governor again or to attempt a return to the senate others that he would become a railroad executive johnson found greeneville boring and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son robert in 1869 seeking vindication for himself and revenge against his political enemies he launched a senate bid soon after returning home tennessee had gone republican but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the  kept down the african american vote leading to a democratic victory in the legislative elections in august 1869 johnson was seen as a likely victor in the senate election although hated by radical republicans and also by some democrats because of his wartime activities although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislatures balloting the republicans eventually elected  over johnson 54–51 in 1872 there was a special election for an  johnson initially sought the democratic nomination but when he saw that it would go to former confederate general  decided to run as an independent the former president was defeated finishing third but the split in the democratic party defeated cheatham in favor of an old johnson unionist ally 
in 1873 johnson contracted  during an epidemic but recovered that year he lost about 73000 when the first national bank of washington went under though he was eventually repaid much of the sum he began looking towards the next senate election to take place in the legislature in early 1875 johnson began to woo the farmers  with his  he easily gained their support he spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour few african americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as reconstruction faded in tennessee setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other southern states the white domination would last almost a century in the tennessee legislative elections in august the democrats elected 92 legislators to the republicans eight and johnson went to nashville for the legislative session when the balloting for the senate seat began on january 20 1875 he led with 30 votes but did not have the required majority as three former confederate generals one former colonel and a former democratic congressman split the vote with him johnsons opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him but failed and he was elected on january 26 on the 54th ballot with a margin of a single vote nashville erupted in rejoicing remarked johnson thank god for the vindication
johnsons comeback garnered national attention with the st louis republican calling it the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of american politics can show at his swearing in in the senate on march 5 1875 he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president hamlin by that offices current incumbent  who as senator had voted for his ousting many republicans ignored senator johnson though some such as ohios  who had voted for conviction shook his hand johnson remains the only former president to serve in the senate he spoke only once in the short session on march 22 lambasting president grant for his use of federal troops in support of louisianas reconstruction government the former president asked how far off is military despotism and concluded his speech may god bless this people and god save the constitution
johnson returned home after the special session concluded in late july convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the ohio gubernatorial race he decided to travel there to give speeches he began the trip on july 28 and broke the journey at his daughter marys farm near  where his daughter martha was also staying that evening he suffered a stroke but used medical treatment until the next day when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from elizabethton he seemed to respond to their ministrations but suffered another stroke on the evening of july 30 and died early the following morning at the age of 66 president grant had the painful duty of announcing the death of the only surviving past president northern newspapers in their obituaries tended to focus on johnsons loyalty during the war while southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president johnsons funeral was held on august 3 in greeneville he was buried with his body wrapped in an american flag and a copy of the us constitution placed under his head according to his wishes the burial ground was dedicated as the  in 1906 and with his home and tailors shop is part of the 
according to castel historians of johnsons presidency have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event reconstruction through the remainder of the 19th century there were few historical evaluations of johnson and his presidency memoirs from northerners who had dealt with him such as former vice president henry wilson and maine senator  depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the south in reconstruction but who was frustrated by congress according to historian  in his journal article about the historiography of reconstruction men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth thus alabama congressman and historian  and his corroborators presented a southern indictment of northern policies and henry wilsons history was a brief for the north
the turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of johnson leading the wave was pulitzer prize winning historian  who wrote of the former president
rhodes ascribed johnsons faults to his personal weaknesses and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum south other early 20th century historians such as   who later became president himself and  all southerners concurred with rhodes believing johnson flawed and politically inept but concluding that he had tried to carry out lincolns plans for the south in good faith author and journalist jay tolson suggests that wilson depicted reconstruction as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists the so called carpetbaggers and cynical white southerners or scalawags who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain
even as rhodes and his school wrote  was setting out on the full rehabilitation of johnson using for the first time primary sources such as his papers provided by his daughter martha before her death in 1901 and the diaries of johnsons navy secretary  first published in 1911 the resulting volumes such as david miller dewitts the impeachment and trial of president andrew johnson 1903 presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him in james schoulers 1913 history of the reconstruction period the author accused rhodes of being quite unfair to johnson though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves these works had an effect although historians continued to view johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency they saw his reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct a series of highly favorable biographies in the late 1920s and early 1930s that glorified johnson and condemned his enemies accelerated this trend   quote is from castel   
beale wondered in 1940 is it not time that we studied the history of reconstruction without first assuming at least subconsciously that carpetbaggers and southern white republicans were wicked that negroes were illiterate incompetents and that the whole white south owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of white supremacy despite these doubts the favorable view of johnson survived for a time in 1942  portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the hollywood film  in 1948 a poll of his colleagues by historian  deemed johnson among the average presidents in 1956 one by clinton l rossiter named him as one of the near great chief executives foner notes that at the time of these surveys the reconstruction era that followed the civil war was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote
earlier historians including beale believed that money drives events and had seen reconstruction as an economic struggle they also accepted for the most part that reconciliation between north and south should have been the top priority of reconstruction in the 1950s historians began to focus on the african american as central to reconstruction they rejected completely any claim of black inferiority which had marked many earlier historical works and saw the developing  as a second reconstruction  they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights these authors sympathized with the radical republicans for their desire to help the african american and saw johnson as callous towards the freedman in a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as  the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedmans lot these volumes included major biographies of stevens and stanton reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society
in the early 21st century johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in us history according to historian glenn w lafantasie who believes buchanan the worst president johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachmentampnbsp his complete mishandling of reconstruction policyampnbsp his bristling personality and his enormous sense of self importance tolson suggests that johnson is now scorned for having resisted radical republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well being of the newly emancipated african americans gordon reed notes that johnson along with his contemporaries pierce and buchanan are generally listed among the five worst presidents but states there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation the problems these men had to confront were enormous it would have taken a succession of lincolns to do them justice
tousse considers johnsons legacy to be the maintenance of white supremacy his boost to southern conservatives by undermining reconstruction was his legacy to the nation one that would trouble the country for generations to come gordon reed states of johnson

on 7 april 1940 while at the university solzhenitsyn married natalia alekseevna reshetovskaya  they had just over a year of married life before he went into the army then to the gulag they divorced in 1952 a year before his release because wives of gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits after the end of his internal exile they remarried in 1957 p 366  divorcing a second time in 1972

solzhenitsyns adopted son dmitri turin died on march 18 1994 age 32 in cavendish vermont shortly before he could return with his father to russia
after  in 1956 solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and  following his return from exile solzhenitsyn was while teaching at a secondary school during the day spending his nights secretly engaged in writing in his nobel prize acceptance speech he wrote that during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared this would become known 
in 1960 aged 42 he approached  a poet and the chief editor of the novyi mir magazine with the manuscript of  it was published in edited form in 1962 with the explicit approval of  who defended it at the presidium of the politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication and added theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil  the book quickly sold out and became an instant hit in the 1960s while he was publicly known to be writing cancer ward he was simultaneously writing the gulag archipelago during khrushchevs tenure one day in the life of ivan denisovich was studied in schools in the soviet union as were three more short works of solzhenitsyns including his acclaimed short story matryonas home published in 1963 these would be the last of his works published in the soviet union until 1990
one day in the life of ivan denisovich brought the soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the west  it caused as much of a sensation in the soviet union as it did in the west—not only by its striking realism and candor but also because it was the first major piece of soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme written by a non party member indeed a man who had been to siberia for libelous speech about the leaders and yet its publication had been officially permitted in this sense the publication of solzhenitsyns story was an almost unheard of instance of free unrestrained discussion of politics through literature most soviet readers realized this but after khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964 the time for such raw exposing works came to an end
solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt with the help of tvardovsky to get his novel cancer ward legally published in the soviet union this had to get the approval of the  though some there appreciated it the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti soviet insinuations 
after krushchevs removal in 1964 the cultural climate again became more repressive publishing of solzhenitsyns work quickly stopped as a writer he became a  and by 1965 the  had seized some of his papers including the manuscript of the first circle meanwhile solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings the gulag archipelago  the seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an officially acclaimed writer something which had come close to second nature but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant
after the kgb had confiscated solzhenitsyns materials in moscow during 1965–67 the preparatory drafts of  were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends homes in  aleksandr solzhenitsyn had befriended  a lawyer and former estonian minister of education in a  prison cell after completion solzhenitsyns original handwritten script was kept hidden from the kgb in estonia by arnold susis daughter heli susi until the collapse of the soviet union  
in 1969 solzhenitsyn was expelled from the union of writers in 1970 he was awarded the  he could not receive the prize personally in  at that time since he was afraid he would not be let back into the soviet union instead it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the swedish embassy in moscow  the swedish government used to accept this solution however since such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the soviet union and damage swedish soviet relations instead solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the soviet union
the gulag archipelago was composed during 1958–67  this work was a three volume seven part work on the soviet prison camp system solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at any one time the gulag archipelago has sold over thirty million copies in thirty five languages it was based upon solzhenitsyns own experience as well as the testimony of 256  former prisoners and solzhenitsyns own research into the history of the penal system  it discussed the systems origins from the founding of the communist regime with  having responsibility detailing interrogation procedures prisoner transports prison camp culture  and the practice of 
according to fellow gulag historian  the gulag archipelagos rich and varied authorial voice its unique weaving together of personal testimony philosophical analysis and historical investigation and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made the gulag archipelago one of the most impactful books of the 20th century 
the gulag archipelago was met with extensive criticism by party controlled soviet press even though the book was not published in the ussr an editorial in  on 14 january 1974 accused solzhenitsyn of supporting hitlerites and making excuses for the crimes of the  and  gangs according to the editorial solzhenitsyn was choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up for the socialist system and for soviet people 
during this period he was sheltered by the cellist  who suffered considerably for his support of solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself
in august 1971 the kgb allegedly made an attempt to assassinate solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent most likely  with an experimental gel based delivery method the attempt left him seriously ill but ultimately was not successful  
on 12 february 1974 solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the soviet union to  west germany and stripped of his soviet citizenship name nyt20080804  the kgb had found the manuscript for the first part of the gulag archipelago and less than a week later  suffered reprisals for his support of solzhenitsyn us military attaché  managed to smuggle out a large portion of solzhenitsyns archive including the authors membership card for the  and second world war military citations solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to odoms role in his memoir invisible allies 1995 
in west germany solzhenitsyn lived in s house in  he then moved to  switzerland before  invited him to stay in the united states to facilitate your work and to accommodate you and your family he stayed on the 11th floor of the  part of the  before moving to  vermont in 1976 he was given an honorary literary degree from  in 1978 and on thursday 8 june 1978 he gave his commencement address name harvard  condemning among other things  in modern western culture
over the next 17 years solzhenitsyn worked on his dramatized history of the   by 1992 four knots parts had been completed and he had also written several shorter works
despite spending almost two decades in the united states solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken english he had however been reading english language literature since his teens encouraged by his mother more importantly he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television solzhenitsyns warnings about the dangers of communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the west were generally well received in western conservative circles eg ford administration staffers  and  advocated on solzhenitsyns behalf for him to speak directly to then president  about the soviet threat  prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by us president  at the same time liberals and  became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his  perence for  and the  religion
solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant  of the modern west including television and much of popular music the human soul longs for things higher warmer and purer than those offered by todays mass living habits by tv stupor and by intolerable music despite his criticism of the weakness of the west solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies in a major speech delivered to the international academy of philosophy in liechtenstein on 14 september 1993 solzhenitsyn implored the west not to lose sight of its own values its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen p 599 
in a series of writings speeches and interviews after his return to his native russia in 1994 solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self government he had witnessed first hand in switzerland and new england during his western exilerussia in collapse in  pp 480–1 the cavendish farewell in  pp 606–7  he praised the sensible and sure process of  in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities   solzhenitsyns patriotism was inward looking he called for russia to renounce all mad fantasies of foreign conquest and begin the peaceful long long long period of recuperation as he put it in a 1979 bbc interview with janis sapiets 
in 1990 his soviet citizenship was restored and in 1994 he returned to russia with his wife natalia who had become a united states citizen their sons stayed behind in the united states later his oldest son yermolai returned to russia to work for the moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm from then until his death he lived with his wife in a  in troitse lykovo Троице Лыково in west moscow between the dachas once occupied by soviet leaders  and  a staunch believer in traditional russian culture solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post soviet russia in works such as rebuilding russia and called for the establishment of a strong presidential republic balanced by vigorous institutions of local self government the latter would remain his major political theme  after returning to russia in 1994 solzhenitsyn published eight two part short stories a series of contemplative miniatures or prose poems a literary memoir on his years in the west the grain between the millstones among many other writings once back in russia solzhenitsyn hosted a television talk show programhttp  wwwnytimescom 1995 04 14 world now on moscow tv heeere s aleksandrhtml now on moscow tv heeeres aleksandr – new york times   bot generated title     its eventual format was solzhenitsyn delivering a 15 minute monologue twice a month it was discontinued in 1995http  articleslatimescom 1995 09 26 news mn 50166_1_talk show russian tv pulls the plug on solzhenitsyns biting talk show – los angeles times   bot generated title

in a november 13 1985 review of solzhenitsyns novel august 1914 in the   historian  commented every culture has its own brand of anti semitism  in solzhenitsyns case its not racial it has nothing to do with blood hes certainly not a racist the question is fundamentally religious and cultural he bears some resemblance to  who was a fervent christian and patriot and a rabid anti semite solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the russian extreme rights view of the revolution which is that it was  p 490 
  survivor  denied this claim and insisted that solzhenitsyn was not an anti semite he is too intelligent too honest too courageous too great a writer he added he wished solzhenitsyn were more sensitive to jewish suffering but believed his insensitivity to be unconscious p 491 
in his 1998 book russia in collapse solzhenitsyn excoriated the russian extreme rights obsession with anti semitic and anti masonic  p 496 
in 2001 however solzhenitsyn published a two volume work on the history of russian jewish relations  2001 2002 a bestseller in russia the book triggered renewed accusations of     name young  
the controversy was fueled by the similarities between two hundred years together and an anti semitic essay titled jews in the ussr and in the future russia according to professor of jewish history  textological analyses of the essay indicate solzhenitsyns authorship 
solzhenitsyn responded by saying that the essay was written using manuscripts stolen from him by the kgb forty years before they were then caully edited as part of the soviet states  against him name young  
although two hundred years together has never been published in the  long excerpts from it appear in the solzhenitsyn reader the book began with a plea for patient mutual comprehension on the part of russian gentiles and jews solzhenitsyn explained that the book was conceived in the hope of promoting mutually agreeable and fruitful pathways for the future development of russian jewish relations p 489 
in chapter 9 solzhenitsyn said that it would be quite wrong to say that the jews organized the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 just as it was not organized by any other nation as such
at the end of chapter 15 solzhenitsyn expressed a belief that every people must answer morally for all of its past    including that past which is shameful in this spirit he urged the jewish people to answer both for the revolutionary cutthroats and the ranks willing to serve them it is not he insists a matter of answering before other peoples but to oneself to ones consciousness and before god he explains that russian gentiles must also repent for the s for those merciless arsonist peasants for those crazed revolutionary soldiers for those savage sailors to answer just as we would answer for members of our own family for if we release ourselves from any responsibility for the actions of our national kin the very concept of a people loses any real meaning p 505 
in some of his later political writings such as rebuilding russia 1990 and russia in collapse 1998 solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new russian democracy while opposing any nostalgia for soviet communism he defended moderate and self critical patriotism as opposed to  urged local self government to a free russia and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic russians in the  of the former soviet union
in a 2007 interview with  solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the conflation of soviet and russian against which i spoke so often in the 1970s has not passed away in the west in the ex socialist countries or in the former soviet republics the elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations with present day moscow as a convenient target they behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now while moscow has remained communist nevertheless i dare to hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history name solzhenitsyn 2007 
delivering the commencement address at  in 1978 he called the united states spiritually weak and mired in vulgar  americans he said speaking in russian through a translator suffered from a decline in courage and a lack of manliness few were willing to die for their ideals he said he condemned both the united states government and american society for its hasty capitulation in the  he criticized the countrys music as intolerable and attacked its  accusing it of violations of privacy he said that the west erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model  while faulting soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people he also faulted the west for being too legalistic a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities name harvard

according to solzhenitsyn russians were not the ruling nation in the soviet union he believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and marxist leninism russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the soviet union since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among russian christians than among any other ethnicity theore solzhenitsyn argued  and the  should not be regarded as a threat by the west but rather as allies 
in rebuilding russia an essay first published in 1990 in  solzhenitsyn urged russia to grant independence to all the non slav republics which he claimed were sapping the russian nation and he called for the creation of a new slavic state bringing together russia   and parts of  that he considered to be  name  rflsolukma

solzhenitsyn criticized the  for not opening a new front against  in the west earlier in world war ii this resulted in soviet domination and oppression of the nations of eastern europe solzhenitsyn claimed the western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the east as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the west
in 1973 near the height of the  solzhenitsyn sent a letter to the soviet leaders to a limited number of upper echelon soviet officials this work which was published for the general public in the western world a year after it was sent to its intended audience beseeched the soviet unions authorities to

an antipope  is a person who in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected  makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the popeone who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of rome endeavours to secure the papal throne and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt http  wwwbritannicacom ebchecked topic 28501 antipope encyclopædia britannica antipope  the  and leader of the  at times between the 3rd and mid 15th century antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious  and secular s and kingdoms persons who claim to be pope but have few followers such as the modern  antipopes are not classified with the historical antipopes
 dampnbsp235 is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope as he headed a separate group within the church in rome against  hippolytus was reconciled to callixtuss second successor  and both he and pontian are honoured as saints by the roman catholic church with a shared  on 13 august whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of hippolytus  and whether hippolytus actually declared himself to be the bishop of rome remains unclear since no such claim by hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him
 quotes v 28  from an unnamed earlier writer the story of natalius a  priest who accepted the bishopric of a heretical group in rome natalius soon repented and tearfully begged  to receive him into communion  
 d 258 another 3rd century figure certainly claimed the see of rome in opposition to  and if natalius and hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them novatian could then be said to be the first antipope
the period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the s of the 11th and 12th centuries the emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes the popes likewise sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants s in germany to overcome a particular emperor
the —which began in 1378 when the french cardinals claiming that the election of  was invalid elected  as pope—led to two and eventually three rival lines of claimants to the papacy the roman line the  clement vii took up residence in  france and the  line the pisan line was named after the town of pisa italy where the pisan council had elected  as a third claimant to end the schism in may 1415 the  deposed  of the pisan line  of the roman line resigned in july 1415 in 1417 the council also formally deposed  of avignon but he used to resign afterwards  was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to benedict xiii the scandal of the western schism created anti papal sentiment and fed into the  at the turn of the 16th century
the following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the  with the addition of the names of natalius in spite of doubts about his historicity and  whose following was insignificanthttp  wwwnewadventorg cathen 09725ahtm michael ott pope martin v in catholic encyclopedia new york 1910

about 430 97% of the  cultured as of 2007 were domesticated during the 20th and 21st centuries of which an estimated 106 came in the decade to 2007 given the long term importance of agriculture it is interesting to note that to date only 008% of known land plant species and 00002% of known land animal species have been domesticated compared with 017% of known marine plant species and 013% of known marine animal species domestication typically involves about a decade of scientific research name duartemarbaholmer  domesticating aquatic species involves fewer risks to humans than do land animals which took a large toll in human lives most major human diseases originated in domesticated animals  including diseases such as  and  that like most infectious diseases move to humans from animals no human s of comparable virulence have yet emerged from marine species 
biological control methods to manage parasites are already being used such as cleaner fish eg lumpsuckers and wrasse to control sea lice populations in salmon farming  models are being used to help with spatial planning and siting of fish farms in order to minimize impact 
the decline in wild fish stocks has increased the demand for farmed fish  however it is necessary to find alternative sources of protein and oil for fish feed so the aquaculture industry can grow sustainably otherwise it represents a great risk for the over exploitation of forage fish 
another recent issue following the banning in 2008 of organotins by the imo international maritime organization is the need to find environmentally friendly but still effective compounds with antifouling effects

a similar process is used in the salmon farming section of this industry juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation for example as stated above one of the most important fish species in the industry the salmon can be grown using a cage system this is done by having netted cages perably in open water that has a strong flow and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that will aid in their growth this process allows for year round growth of the fish and thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons

in  a subfield of  and  the kolmogorov complexity also known as descriptive complexity kolmogorov– complexity algorithmic entropy or program size complexity of an object such as a piece of text is a measure of the al resources needed to specify the object it is named after  who first published on the subject in 1963  
for example consider the following two  of 32 lowercase letters and digits

the first string has a short english language description namely ttab 16 times tt which consists of 11 characters the second one has no obvious simple description using the same character set other than writing down the string itself which has 32 characters
more formally the  of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed  description language the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below it can be shown that the kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself strings like the abab example above whose kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the strings size are not considered to be complex
the notion of kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to   and 
the kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings we must first specify a description language for strings  such a description language can be based on any computer programming language such as   or  bytecode  if p is a program which outputs a string x then p is a description of x the length of the description is just the length of p as a character string multiplied by the number of bits in a character eg 7 for 
we could alternatively choose an encoding for s where an encoding is a function which associates to each turing machine m a bitstring m if m is a turing machine which on input w outputs string x then the concatenated string m w is a description of x for theoretical analysis this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally perred in the research literature in this article an informal approach is discussed
any string s has at least one description namely the program
  function generatefixedstring
     return s
if a description of s ds is of minimal length ie it uses the fewest bits it is called a minimal description of s  thus the length of ds ie the number of bits in the description is the kolmogorov complexity of s written ks symbolically
ks    ds 
the length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language but the effect of changing languages is bounded a result called the invariance theorem
there are some description languages which are optimal in the following sense given any description of an object in a description language i can use that description in my optimal description language with a constant overhead the constant depends only on the languages involved not on the description of the object nor the object being described
here is an example of an optimal description language a description will have two parts
 the first part describes another description language
 the second part is a description of the object in that language
in more technical terms the first part of a description is a computer program with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output
the invariance theorem follows given any description language l the optimal description language is at least as efficient as l with some constant overhead
proof any description d in l can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing l as a computer program p part 1 and then using the original description d as input to that program part 2 the 
total length of this new description d’ is approximately
 d’     p  +  d 
the length of p is a constant that doesnt depend on d so there is at most a constant overhead regardless of the object described theore the optimal language is universal  this additive constant
theorem if ksub1 sub and ksub2 sub are the complexity functions relative to  description languages lsub1 sub and lsub2 sub then there is a constant c – which depends only on the languages lsub1 sub and lsub2 sub chosen – such that
∀s   c ≤ ksub1 subs   ksub2 subs ≤ c
proof by symmetry it suffices to prove that there is some constant c such that for all strings s
ksub1 subs ≤ ksub2 subs + c
now suppose there is a program in the language lsub1 sub which acts as an  for lsub2 sub
   function interpretlanguagestring p
where p is a program in lsub2 sub the interpreter is characterized by the following property
 running codeinterpretlanguage code on input p returns the result of running p
thus if p is a program in lsub2 sub which is a minimal description of s then codeinterpretlanguage codep returns the string s the length of this description of s is the sum of
# the length of the program codeinterpretlanguage code which we can take to be the constant c
# the length of p which by definition is ksub2 subs
this proves the desired upper bound
 is the area of computer science that studies kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings or other s
the concept and theory of kolmogorov complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by  who published it in 1960 describing it in a preliminary report on a general theory of inductive inference http  worldstdcom ~rjs z138pdf revision nov 1960  as part of his invention of  he gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications a formal theory of inductive inference part 1 and part 2 in information and control  
andrey kolmogorov later  this theorem in problems inform transmission  in 1965 gregory chaitin also presents this theorem in j acm – chaitins paper was submitted october 1966 and revised in december 1968 and cites both solomonoffs and kolmogorovs papers 
the theorem says that among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions codes there exists an optimal one this algorithm for all strings allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms but not on the strings themselves solomonoff used this algorithm and the code lengths it allows to define a universal probability of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings including complexity randomness and information
when kolmogorov became aware of solomonoffs work he acknowledged solomonoffs priority  for several years solomonoffs work was better known in the soviet union than in the western world the general consensus in the scientific community however was to associate this type of complexity with kolmogorov who was concerned with randomness of a sequence while algorithmic probability became associated with solomonoff who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution the broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called kolmogorov complexity the computer scientist ming li considers this an example of the   to everyone who has more will be given  
there are several other variants of kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information the most widely used one is based on s and is mainly due to  1974
an axiomatic approach to kolmogorov complexity based on  blum 1967 was introduced by mark burgin in the paper presented for publication by andrey kolmogorov burgin 1982
in the following discussion let ks be the complexity of the string s
it is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself   the program codegeneratefixedstring code above that outputs s is a fixed amount larger than s
theorem there is a constant c such that
∀s ks ≤  s  + c
theorem there exist strings of arbitrarily large kolmogorov complexity formally for each n ∈ ℕ there is a string s with ks ≥ n group notehowever an s with ks   n neednt exist for every n for example if n isnt a multiple of 7 bits no  program can have a length of exactly n bits 
proof otherwise all infinitely many possible strings could be generated by the finitely many group notethere are 1 + 2 + 2sup2 sup + 2sup3 sup +  + 2supn sup   2supn+1 sup ampminus 1 different program texts of length up to n bits cf  if program lengths are to be multiples of 7 bits even fewer program texts exist  programs with a complexity below n bits
theorem  k is not a  in other words there is no program which takes a string s as input and produces the integer ks as output
the following  uses a simple  like language to denote programs for sake of proof simplicity assume its description ie an  to have a length of  bits
assume for contradiction there is a program
   function kolmogorovcomplexitystring s
which takes as input a string s and returns ks for sake of proof simplicity assume its length to be  bits
now consider the following program of length  bits
   function generatecomplexstring
      for i   1 to infinity
         for each string s of length exactly i
            if kolmogorovcomplexitys   8000000000
               return s
using codekolmogorovcomplexity code as a subroutine the program tries every string starting with the shortest until it returns a string with kolmogorov complexity at least  bits group noteby the previous theorem such a string exists hence the codefor code loop will eventually terminate  ie a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than  bits however the overall length of the above program that produced s is only  bits group noteincluding the language interpreter and the subroutine code for codekolmogorovcomplexity code  which is a contradiction if the code of codekolmogorovcomplexity code is shorter the contradiction remains if it is longer the constant used in codegeneratecomplexstring code can always be changed appropriately group noteif codekolmogorovcomplexity code has length n bits the constant m used in codegeneratecomplexstring code needs to be adapted to satisfy  which is always possible since m grows faster than logsub10 subm 
the above proof used a contradiction similar to that of the  sub subthe sub subsmallest sub subpositive sub subinteger sub subthat sub subcannot sub subbe sub subdefined sub subin sub subfewer sub subthan sub subtwenty sub subenglish sub subwords it is also possible to show the non computability of k by reduction from the non computability of the halting problem h since k and h are stated without proof in http  wwwdaimiaudk ~bromille dc05 kolmogorovpdf course notes for data compression   kolmogorov complexity 2005 pb miltersen p7 
there is a corollary humorously called the  in the programming language community stating that there is no perfect size optimizing compiler
the chain rule  for kolmogorov complexity states that
kxy   kx + ky x + ologkxy
it states that the shortest program that reproduces x and y is  than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce x and a program to reproduce y given x using this statement one can define 
it is straightforward to compute upper bounds for ks – simply  the string s with some method implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string and measure the length of the resulting string – concretely the size of a  in the given language
a string s is compressible by a number c if it has a description whose length does not exceed  s ampminusc bits this is equivalent to saying that ks ≤  s  c  otherwise s is incompressible by c a string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply incompressible – by the  which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string s must exist since there are 2supn sup bit strings of length n but only 2supn sup   1 shorter strings that is strings of length less than n ie with length 01nampnbspampminusampnbsp1 group noteas there are  strings of length l the number of strings of lengths  is     which is a finite  with sum     
for the same reason most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed – their ks is not much smaller than  s  the length of s in bits to make this precise fix a value of n there are 2supn sup bitstrings of length n the   distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2sup−n sup to each string of length n
theorem with the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length n the probability that a string is incompressible by c is at least 1   2sup−c+1 sup + 2sup−n sup
to prove the theorem note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding n c is given by the geometric series
1 + 2 + 2sup2 sup +  + 2supn c sup   2supn c+1 sup   1
there remain at least
2supn sup   2supn c+1 sup + 1
bitstrings of length n that are incompressible by c  to determine the probability divide by 2supn sup
we know that in the set of all possible strings most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly compressed way however it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold the precise formalization is as follows first fix a particular  s for the s the axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that to certain assertions  a about complexity of strings one can associate a formula fsuba sub in s this association must have the following property
if fsuba sub is provable from the axioms of s then the corresponding assertion a must be true this formalization can be achieved either by an artificial encoding such as a  or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of s
theorem there exists a constant l which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language such that there does not exist a string s for which the statement
ks ≥  l as formalized in s
can be proven within the axiomatic system s
note that by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings the vast majority of those statements must be true
the proof of this result is modeled on a self erential construction used in  the proof is by contradiction if the theorem were false then
assumption x for any integer n there exists a string s for which there is a proof in s of the formula ksampnbsp≥ampnbspn which we assume can be formalized in s
we can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in s by some procedure
   function nthproofint n
which takes as input n and outputs some proof this function enumerates all proofs some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here since every possible proof in the language of s is produced for some n some of these are complexity formulas of the form ksampnbsp≥ampnbspn where s and n are constants in the language of s there is a program
   function nthproofprovescomplexityformulaint n
which determines whether the nth proof actually proves a complexity formula ksampnbsp≥ampnbspl the strings s and the integer l in turn are computable by programs
   function stringnthproofint n
   function complexitylowerboundnthproofint n
consider the following program
   function generateprovablycomplexstringint n
      for i   1 to infinity
         if  nthproofprovescomplexityformulai and complexitylowerboundnthproofi ≥ n
            return stringnthproofi
given an n this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the  s of the formula ksampnbsp≥ampnbspl for some lampnbsp≥ampnbspn the program terminates by our assumption x now this program has a length u there is an integer nsub0 sub such that uampnbsp+ampnbsplogsub2 subnsub0 subampnbsp+ampnbspcampnbspampnbspnsub0 sub where c is the overhead cost of
    function generateprovablyparadoxicalstring
       return generateprovablycomplexstringnsub0 sub
note that nsub0 sub is hard coded into the above function and the summand logsub2 subnsub0 sub already allows for its encoding the program generateprovablyparadoxicalstring outputs a string s for which there exists an l such that ksampnbsp≥ampnbspl can be formally proved in s with lampnbsp≥ampnbspnsub0 sub in particular ksampnbsp≥ampnbspnsub0 sub is true however s is also described by a program of length uampnbsp+ampnbsplogsub2 subnsub0 subampnbsp+ampnbspc so its complexity is less than nsub0 sub  this contradiction proves assumption x cannot hold
similar ideas are used to prove the properties of 
the  principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by  and dm boulton in 1968 mml is  ie it incorporates prior beliefs and information theoretic it has the desirable properties of statistical invariance ie the inference transforms with a re parametrisation such as from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates statistical consistency ie even for very hard problems mml will converge to any underlying model and efficiency ie the mml model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible cs wallace and dl dowe 1999 showed a formal connection between mml and algorithmic information theory or kolmogorov complexity
kolmogorov randomness – also called algorithmic randomness – defines a string usually of s as being  if and only if it is shorter than any  that can produce that string  to make this precise a  or universal turing machine must be specified so that program means a program for this universal machine a random string in this sense is incompressible in that it is impossible to compress the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself  a  is used to show that for any universal computer there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length  whether any particular string is random however depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen
this definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for infinite sequences from a finite alphabet these s can be defined in three equivalent ways one way uses an effective analogue of  another uses effective   the third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the pix free kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough   there must be a constant c such that the complexity of an initial segment of length n is always at least nampminusc  this definition unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string is not affected by which universal machine is used to define pix free kolmogorov complexity
 
for dynamical systems entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of brudno that the equality kxt    ht holds for almost all x 
it can be shown  that for the output of s kolmogorov complexity is related to the  of the information source more precisely the kolmogorov complexity of the output of a markov information source normalized by the length of the output converges almost surely as the length of the output goes to infinity to the  of the source
the conditional kolmogorov complexity of two strings kx y is roughly speaking defined as the kolmogorov complexity of x given y as an auxiliary input to the procedure name rissanen2007  
there is also a length conditional complexity kx lx which is the complexity of x given the length of x as known input

the triumph of time is a poem by  published in  in 1866 it is in adapted  and is full of elaborate use of literary devices particularly  the theme which purports to be autobiographical is that of rejected love the speaker deplores the ruin of his life and in tones at times reminiscent of  craves oblivion for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor

alfred the great 849 – 26 october 899  elf counsel or wise elf was king of  from 871 to 899
alfred successfully defended his kingdom against the  attempt at conquest and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in yorke alfred  he is one of only two english monarchs to be given the  the great the other being the scandinavian  he was also the first  to style himself king of the  details of alfreds life are described in a work by the   scholar and bishop  a devout  alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level headed nature who encouraged education and improved his kingdoms  system  structure and his peoples quality of life
alfred was born in the village of wanating now   he was the youngest son of king  by his first wife alfred was the youngest of either four weir alison britains royal families the complete genealogy 1989 p5 or five brothers http  wwwroyalgovuk historyofthemonarchy kingsandqueensofengland theanglo saxonkings alfredthegreataspx the primary record conflicting regarding whether  was a brother or uncle 
in 853 at the age of four alfred is said to have been sent to  where according to the  name aschronhttp  wwwgutenbergorg files 657 657txt the anglo saxon chronicle freely licensed version at gutenberg project note this electronic edition is a collation of material from nine diverse extant versions of the chronicle it contains primarily the translation of rev james ingram as published in the everyman edition  he was confirmed by  who anointed him as king  writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory  in preparation for his ultimate succession to the throne of wessex however his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as alfred had three living elder brothers a letter of leo iv shows that alfred was made a  a misinterpretation of this investiture deliberate or accidental could explain later confusion it may also be based on alfreds later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to rome where he spent some time at the court of   around 854–855
on their return from rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed by his son  with civil war looming the s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise Æthelbald would retain the western shires ie traditional wessex and Æthelwulf would rule in the east when king Æthelwulf died in 858 wessex was ruled by three of alfreds brothers in succession Æthelbald  and  
bishop asser tells the story of how as a child alfred won a prize of a volume of poetry in saxon offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize itasserius de rebus gestis aelfredi florentius wigorniensis 23 ad 866  legend also has it that the young alfred spent time in ireland seeking healing alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life it is thought that he may have suffered from  name rsm303   statues of alfred in winchester and wantage portray him as a great warrior evidence suggests he was not physically strong and though not lacking in courage he was noted more for his intellect than a warlike charactercornwell bernard 2009 historical note p 385 and following in the burning land harper 
during the short reigns of the older two of his three elder brothers  and  alfred is not mentioned an army of  which the anglo saxon chronicle described as the  had landed in east anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted anglo saxon england in 865 name keyns16keynes  lapidge alfred the great pp16–17  it was with the backdrop of a rampaging viking army that alfreds public life began with the accession of his third brother  in 865
it is during this period that bishop asser applied to alfred the unique title of secundarius which may indicate a position akin to that of the ic  a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch it is possible that this arrangement was sanctioned by alfreds father or by the  to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle the arrangement of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well known among other   such as the  and  to whom the anglo saxons were closely related
in 868 alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the great heathen army led by  out of the adjoining  name aschron  at the end of 870 the danes arrived in his homeland the year which followed has been called alfreds year of battles nine engagements were fought with varying outcomes though the place and date of two of these battles have not been recorded
in berkshire a successful skirmish at the  on 31 december 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the  by ivars brother  on 5 january 871 four days later the anglo saxons won a brilliant victory at the  on the  possibly near  or  alfred is particularly credited with the success of this latter battle
later that month on 22 january the saxons were defeated at the  they were defeated again on 22 march at the  perhaps marden in  or martin in  Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 april
in april 871 king Æthelred died and alfred succeeded to the throne of wessex and the burden of its defence despite the fact that Æthelred left two under age sons  and  this was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at swinbeorg the brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that king Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will the deceaseds sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired the unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king given the ongoing danish invasion and the youth of his nephews alfreds accession probably went uncontested
while he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother the danes defeated the saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at  in may the defeat at wilton smashed any remaining hope that alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom he was forced instead to make peace with them according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were bishop asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise
indeed the viking army did withdraw from reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in mercian london although not mentioned by asser or by the anglo saxon chronicle alfred probably also paid the vikings cash to leave much as the mercians were to do in the following year s dating to the viking occupation of london in 871 2 have been excavated at   and  these finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the vikings for the next five years the danes occupied other parts of englandbrooks np and ja graham campbell reflections on the viking age silver hoard from croydon  in anglo saxon monetary history essays in memory of michael dolley 1986 pp 91–110 
in 876 under their new leader  the danes slipped past the saxon army and attacked and occupied  in  alfred blockaded them but was unable to take wareham by assault accordingly he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths which the danes swore on a holy ring name aschron  associated with the worship of  the danes however broke their word and after killing all the hostages slipped away under cover of night to  in  name aschron 
alfred blockaded the viking ships in devon and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm the danes were forced to submit the danes withdrew to mercia in january 878 the danes made a sudden attack on  a royal stronghold in which alfred had been staying over christmas and most of the people they killed except the king alfred and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp and after easter he made a fort at  in the marshes of  and from that fort kept fighting against the foe name aschron  from his fort at  an island in the marshes near  alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement rallying the local s from   and 
a popular legend originating from 12th century chronicles  tells how when he first fled to the  alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who unaware of his identity left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return
878 was the low water mark in the history of the anglo saxon kingdoms with all the other kingdoms having fallen to the vikings wessex alone was still resisting p 101 
in the seventh week after easter 4–10 may 878 around  alfred rode to  east of  where he was met by all the people of somerset and of  and of that part of  which is on this side of the sea that is west of  and they rejoiced to see him name aschron  alfreds emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a caully planned offensive that entailed raising the s of three s this meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of  royal s and kings s who were charged with levying and leading these forces but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war alfreds actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers name lavelle187 
alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing  which may have been fought near  he then pursued the danes to their stronghold at  and starved them into submission one of the terms of the surrender was that guthrum convert to  three weeks later the danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at alfreds court at aller near  with alfred receiving guthrum as his spiritual son
the unbinding of the chrism took place with great ceremony eight days later at the royal estate at  in somerset after which guthrum fulfilled his promise to leave wessex there is no contemporary evidence that alfred and guthrum agreed upon a formal treaty at this time the so called  is an invention of modern historians the  preserved in  in  manuscript 383 and in a  compilation known as  was negotiated later perhaps in 879 or 880 when king  was deposed
that treaty divided up the kingdom of mercia by its terms the boundary between alfreds and guthrums kingdoms was to run up the  to the  follow the lea to its source near  from there extend in a straight line to  and from bedford follow the  to  name attenboroughhttp  archiveorg stream lawsofearliesten00grea#page 98 mode 2up treaty of alfred and gunthrum 
in other words alfred succeeded to ceolwulfs kingdom consisting of western mercia and guthrum incorporated the eastern part of mercia into an enlarged  henceforward known as the  by terms of the treaty moreover alfred was to have control over the mercian city of london and its mints—at least for the time beingblackburn mas blackburn the london mint in the reign of alfred in kings currency and alliances history and coinage of southern england in the 9th century ed mas blackburn and dn dumville 1998 pp 105–24  the disposition of  held by west saxon kings since the days of  is unclear from the treaty though given alfreds political and military superiority it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson
with the signing of the  an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when guthrums people began settling  guthrum was neutralised as a threat p 94   in conjunction with this agreement a danish army left the island and sailed to  name asser86 p 86 
alfred was still forced to contend with a number of danish threats a year later in 881 alfred fought a small sea battle against four danish ships on the high seas name asser86  two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to alfreds forces p 76  similar small skirmishes with independent viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period as they had for decades
in the year 883 though there is some debate over the year king alfred because of his support and his donation of alms to rome received a number of gifts from the  p 78   among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the  a true treasure for the devout saxon king according to asser because of pope marinus friendship with king alfred the pope granted an exemption to any anglo saxons residing within rome from tax or tribute p 88 
after the signing of the treaty with guthrum alfred was spared any large scale conflicts for some time despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of danish raids and incursions among these was a raid taking place in  an allied country in  during the year 885 which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with guthrum assers account of the raid places the danish raiders at the saxon city of  name asser86  where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city in response to this incursion alfred led an  force against the danes who instead of engaging the army of wessex fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of britain the retreating danish force supposedly left britain the following summer name asser 1983 p 87 
not long after the failed danish raid in kent alfred dispatched his fleet to east anglia the purpose of this expedition is debated though asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder name asser 1983  after travelling up the  the fleet was met by danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 sources vary on the number and a battle ensued name asser 1983   the anglo saxon fleet emerged victorious and as huntingdon accounts laden with spoils p 81   the victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the river stour and was attacked by a danish force at the mouth of the river the danish fleet was able to defeat alfreds fleet which may have been weakened in the previous engagement p 86 
a year later in 886 alfred reoccupied the city of  and set out to make it habitable again p 24  alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son in law   of mercia the restoration of london progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan added fortifications in addition to the existing roman walls and some believe the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the  p 23 
this is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the saxon people of pre unification england submitted to alfred p 106  this was not however the point at which alfred came to be known as king of england in fact he would never adopt the title for himself in truth the power which alfred wielded over the english peoples at this time seemed to stem largely from the military might of the west saxons alfreds political connections from having the ruler of mercia as his son in law and alfreds keen administrative talents
between the restoration of  and the resumption of large scale danish attacks in the early 890s alfreds reign was rather uneventful the relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of alfreds sister Æthelswith who died en route to rome in 888 p 114  in the same year the  Æthelred also died one year later guthrum or athelstan by his baptismal name alfreds former enemy and king of east anglia died and was buried in  p 89 
guthrums passing changed the political landscape for alfred the resulting power vacuum stirred up other power–hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years the quiet years of alfreds life were coming to a close and war was on the horizon
after another lull in the autumn of 892 or 893 the danes attacked again finding their position in mainland europe precarious they crossed to england in 330 ships in two divisions they entrenched themselves the larger body at  and the lesser under  at  also in kent the invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation alfred in 893 or 894 took up a position from which he could observe both forces name merkle 2009 page 220 
while he was in talks with hastein the danes at appledore broke out and struck northwestwards they were overtaken by alfreds eldest son  and were defeated in a general engagement at  in  they took uge on an island at  on  where they were blockaded and were ultimately forced to submit name merkle 2009 page 220  the force fell back on essex and after suffering another defeat at  coalesced with hasteins force at 
alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at thorney when he heard that the n and east anglian danes were besieging  and an unnamed stronghold on the  shore alfred at once hurried westward and raised the  of  the fate of the other place is not recorded
meanwhile the force under hastein set out to march up the  possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of   and  and forced to head off to the northwest being finally overtaken and blockaded at  some identify this with buttington tump at the mouth of the  others with buttington near  an attempt to break through the english lines was defeated those who escaped retreated to shoebury after collecting reinforcements they made a sudden dash across england and occupied the ruined  walls of  the english did not attempt a winter  but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district
early in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the danes to retire once more to  at the end of the year the danes drew their ships up the  and  and fortified themselves twenty miles 32ampnbspkm north of london a direct attack on the danish lines failed but later in the year alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the danish ships the danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred they struck off north westwards and wintered at  near  the next year 896 or 897 they gave up the struggle some retired to  some to  those who had no connections in england withdrew back to the continent

wessexs history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the danes advantage while both the anglo saxons and the danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources they employed very different strategies in their raids the anglo saxons traditionally perred to attack head on by assembling their forces in a  advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence name abels 1998 pages 194–5 
in contrast the danes perred to choose easy targets mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high stake attacks for more alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance name abels 1998 pages 194–5 
 
these bases were prepared in advance often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches  and s once inside the fortification alfred realised the danes enjoyed the advantage better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned name abels 1998 pages 194–5 
the means by which the anglo saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the vikings it was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids the king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom however in the case of hit and run raids by vikings problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough it was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived and although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with guthrum  name cannon398 
with these lessons in mind alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdoms military defences on a trip to rome alfred had stayed with  and it is possible that he may have studied how the carolingian kings had dealt with the viking problem and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom also there had been a system of fortifications in pre viking mercia that may have been an influence so when the viking raids resumed in 892 alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing mobile field army a network of garrisons and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries  name keynes14

tenants in anglo saxon england had a threefold obligation based on their landholding the so called common burdens of military service fortress work and bridge repair this threefold obligation has traditionally been called trinoda neccessitas or trimoda neccessitas name lavelle70   the old english name for the fine due for neglecting military service was  fierdwite or fyrdwitee name attenborough52  
to maintain the s and to reorganize the fyrd as a standing army alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenants landholding the hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenants public obligations were assessed a hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family the hide would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned name lavelle70   name lapidge238 
at the centre of alfreds ormed military defence system was the network of s distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom  there were thirty three in total spaced approximately  apart enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day  
alfreds burhs later termed  ranged from former roman towns such as winchester where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches probably reinforced with wooden s and palisades such as at burpham sussex name welch127   the size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as pilton to large fortifications in established towns the largest at  which is erenced in  
a contemporary document now known as the  provides an insight into how the system worked it lists the hidage for each of the fortified towns contained in the document for example wallingford had a hidage of 2400 which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2400 men the number sufficient for maintaining  of wall name rumble5   a total of 27071 soldiers were needed system wide or approximately one in four of all the free men in wessex 
many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and connected by a fortified bridge like those built by  a generation before name keynes14  the double burh blocked passage on the river forcing viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones spears or arrows other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas allowing the king better control over his strongholds 
this network of well garrisoned burhs posed significant obstacles to viking invaders especially those laden with booty the system threatened viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the viking raiders however the vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against the burh and a developed doctrine of  having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications the only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this allowed the king time to send assistance with his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs in such cases the vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the kings joint military forces   alfreds burh system posed such a formidable challenge against viking attack that when the vikings returned in 892 and successfully stormed a half made poorly garrisoned fortress up the lympne estuary in  the anglo saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of wessex and mercia 
alfreds burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution his contemporary biographer asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for the common needs of the kingdomasser translated by    
alfred also tried his hand at naval design in 896 name p111 p 111  he ordered the construction of a small fleet perhaps a dozen or so longships that at 60 oars were twice the size of viking warships this was not as the victorians asserted the birth of the  wessex possessed a royal fleet before this  of kent and ealdorman ealhhere had defeated a viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships pp 86–88  and alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882 p 97 
but clearly the author of the anglo saxon chronicle and probably alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of wessex the chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that alfreds ships were not only larger but swifter steadier and rode higher in the water than either danish or frisian ships it is probable that under the classical tutelage of asser alfred utilised the design of  with high sides designed for fighting rather than for navigation name abels 1998 305–307 cf the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in  pp 281–89 
alfred had seapower in mind—if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed he could spare his kingdom from ravaging alfreds ships may have been superior in conception in practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers the only places in which a naval battle could occur name abels 1998 305–307 
the warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but troop carriers it has been suggested that like sea battles in late viking age scandinavia these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel at which point the crew would lash the two ships together before boarding the enemy craft the result was effectively a land battle involving hand to hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels name lavelle286 
in the one recorded naval engagement in the year 896 name aschron  name p111  alfreds new fleet of nine ships intercepted six viking ships in the mouth of an unidentified river along the south of england the danes had beached half their ships and gone inland name p111  either to rest their rowers or to forage for food alfreds ships immediately moved to block their escape to the sea the three viking ships afloat attempted to break through the english lines name p111  only one made it alfreds ships intercepted the other two name p111 
lashing the viking boats to their own the english crew boarded the enemys vessels and proceeded to kill everyone on board the one ship that escaped managed to do so only because all of alfreds heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out name lavelle286   what ensued was a land battle between the crews of the grounded ships the danes heavily outnumbered would have been wiped out if the tide had not risen when that occurred the danes rushed back to their boats which being lighter with shallower drafts were freed before alfreds ships helplessly the english watched as the vikings rowed past them name lavelle286  the pirates had suffered so many casualties 120 danes dead against 62 frisians and english name p111  that they had difficulties putting out to sea all were too damaged to row around sussex and two were driven against the sussex coast possibly at  name p111  name lavelle286  the shipwrecked sailors were brought before alfred at winchester and were hanged name p111 
in the late 880s or early 890s alfred issued a long  or  consisting of his own laws followed by a code issued by his late seventh century predecessor king  name attenborough62attenborough the laws of the earliest english kings http  archiveorg stream lawsofearliesten00grea#page 62 mode 2up alfreds laws retrieved 9 june 2013 pp62–93  together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters in his introduction alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many  books and ordered to be written many of the ones that our foathers observed—those that pleased me and many of the ones that did not please me i rejected with the advice of my councillors and commanded them to be observed in a different wayalfred int 499 trans  p 164 
alfred singled out in particular the laws that he found in the days of ine my kinsman or  king of the mercians or king  who first among the english people received baptism he appended rather than integrated the laws of ine into his code and although he included as had Æthelbert a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts the two injury tariffs are not aligned offa is not known to have issued a law code leading historian  to speculate that alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to offa by two papal legates 
about a fifth of the law code is taken up by alfreds introduction which includes translations into english of the  a few chapters from the  and the apostolic letter from  1523–29 the introduction may best be understood as alfreds meditation upon the meaning of christian law p 215  it traces the continuity between gods gift of law to moses to alfreds own issuance of law to the west saxon people by doing so it links the holy past to the historical present and represents alfreds law giving as a type of divine legislation
this is the reason that alfred divided his code into precisely 120 chapters 120 was the age at which moses died and in the number symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes 120 stood for law  the link between the mosaic law and alfreds code is the apostolic letter which explained that christ had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them and he taught mercy and meekness intro 491 the mercy that christ infused into mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since christian synods established through that mercy which christ taught that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed name keynesalfred intro 497 trans  pp 164–5 
the only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money is treachery to a lord since almighty god adjudged none for those who despised him nor did christ the son of god adjudge any for the one who betrayed him to death and he commanded everyone to love his lord as himself name keynes  alfreds transformation of christs commandment from love your neighbour as yourself matt 2239–40 to love your secular lord as you would love the lord christ himself underscores the importance that alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by god for the governance of man cites alfreds pastoral care ch 28 
when one turns from the dombocs introduction to the laws themselves it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement the impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws the law code as it has been preserved is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits in fact several of alfreds laws contradict  that form an integral part of the code patrick wormalds explanation is that alfreds law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction  in practical terms the most important law in the code may well be the very first we enjoin what is most necessary that each man keep caully his oath and his pledge which expresses a fundamental tenet of anglo saxon lawalfred 2 in  p 164 
alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness alfred according to asser insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and would caully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed issued in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjustasser chap 106 in  p 109  a charter from the reign of his son edward the elder depicts alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his handsthe charter is sawyer 1445 and is printed in english historical documents vol 1 ed dorothy whitelock 2nd edn 1979 pp 544–46 
asser represents alfred as a ic judge painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments although asser never mentions alfreds law code he does say that alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves to the pursuit of wisdom the failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of officeasser chap 106 in  pp 109–10 
the anglo saxon chronicle commissioned at the time of alfred was probably written to promote unification of england name parker48  whereas assers the life of king alfred  promoted alfreds achievements and personal qualities it was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in wales as alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country name parker48 
asser speaks grandiosely of alfreds relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available his interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of  he corresponded with  the  and embassies to rome conveying the english alms to the  were fairly frequentsome versions of the anglo saxon chronicle reported that alfred sent a delegation to india but this could just mean asia and other versions say iudea abels alfred the great pp 190–92  around 890  undertook a journey from  on  along the  to the n trading town of  alfred personally collected details of this trip 
alfreds relations with the celtic princes in the western half of  are clearer comparatively early in his reign according to asser the  princes owing to the pressure on them from  and  commended themselves to alfred later in his reign the  followed their example and the latter cooperated with the english in the campaign of 893 or 894 that alfred sent alms to irish and continental monasteries may be taken on assers authority the visit of the three pilgrim scots ie irish to alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic the story that he himself in his childhood was sent to ireland to be healed by saint  though mythical may show alfreds interest in that island
in the 880s at the same time that he was cajoling and threatening his nobles to build and man the s alfred perhaps inspired by the example of  almost a century before undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning it entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from mercia wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the  the establishment of a court school to educate his own children the sons of his nobles and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority a series of translations into the vernacular of latin works the king deemed most necessary for all men to know name lapidge28  the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of alfreds kingdom and house with a genealogy that stretched back to adam thus giving the west saxon kings a biblical ancestry name gransden34 
very little is known of the church under alfred the danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries and though alfred founded monasteries at athelney and shaftesbury these were the first new monastic houses in wessex since the beginning of the eighth centuryyorke barbara wessex in the early middle ages1995 p 201  according to asser alfred enticed foreign monks to england for his monastery at athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life name asser103 
alfred undertook no systematic orm of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in wessex for him the key to the kingdoms spiritual revival was to appoint pious learned and trustworthy bishops and abbots as king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for alfred name ranft78  name sweet8http  archiveorg stream kingalfredswests00greg#page 2 mode 2up the anglo saxon version of gregorys pastoral pp 1–9 retrieved 16 september 2013 
he was equally comfortable distributing his translation of s  to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands especially estates along the border with the danelaw and transferring them to royal s and officials who could better defend them against viking attacks name sweet8   
the danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in england alfred lamented in the pace to his translation of gregorys pastoral care that learning had declined so thoroughly in england that there were very few men on this side of the humber who could understand their divine services in english or even translate a single letter from latin into english and i suppose that there were not many beyond the humber either p 125  alfred undoubtedly exaggerated for dramatic effect the abysmal state of learning in england during his youth that latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned mercian and west saxon clerics such as plegmund wæferth and wulfsige

alfreds educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school believing that without christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war alfred aimed to set to learning as long as they are not useful for some other employment all the free born young men now in england who have the means to apply themselves to it name pgregpace to alfreds translation of gregory the greats pastoral care in  p 126  conscious of the decay of latin literacy in his realm alfred proposed that primary education be taught in english with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in latin name asser p 126asser p 126 
a problem however was that there were few books of wisdom written in english alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court centred programme of translating into english the books he deemed most necessary for all men to know name asser p 126  it is unknown when alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when wessex was enjoying a respite from viking attacks
apart from the lost handboc or encheiridion which seems to have been a  kept by the king the earliest work to be translated was the dialogues of  a book greatly popular in the  the translation was undertaken at alfreds command by   with the king merely furnishing a pace remarkably alfred undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars translated four works himself gregory the greats pastoral care s  s soliloquies and the first fifty psalms of the  name bately janet 1970 pp 45bately janet king alfred and the old english translation of orosius anglia 88 1970 433–60 idem those books that are most necessary for all men to know the classics and late ninth century england a reappraisal in the classics in the middle ages ed aldo s bernardo and saul levin 1990 pp 45–78 
one might add to this list alfreds translation in his law code of excerpts from the  book of exodus the old english versions of s histories against the pagans and s  are no longer accepted by scholars as alfreds own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences name bately janet 1970 pp 45  nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the alfredian programme of translation  and  suggest this also for balds leechbook and the anonymous old english martyrology pp 33–4 
alfreds first translation was of pope gregory the greats pastoral care which he paced with an introduction explaining why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this one from latin into english although he described his method as translating sometimes word for word sometimes sense for sense alfreds translation actually keeps very close to his original although through his choice of language he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority alfred meant his translation to be used and circulated it to all his bishops interest in alfreds translation of pastoral care was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century 
boethius consolation of philosophy was the most popular philosophical handbook of the middle ages unlike his translation of the pastoral care alfred here deals very freely with his original and though the late dr g schepssdr g schepss zu könig alfreds boethius in archiv für das studium der neueren sprachen xciv 1895 pp 149–160  showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to alfred himself but to the glosses and commentaries which he used still there is much in the work which is solely alfreds and highly characteristic of his style it is in the boethius that the oft quoted sentence occurs my will was to live worthily as long as i lived and after my life to leave to them that should come after my memory in good works the book has come down to us in two manuscripts only in one of theseoxford bodleian library ms bodley 180  the writing is prose in the otherbritish library cotton ms otho a vi  a combination of prose and alliterating verse

the last of alfreds works is one to which he gave the name blostman ie blooms or anthology the first half is based mainly on the soliloquies of st  the remainder is drawn from various sources and contains much that is alfreds own and highly characteristic of him the last words of it may be quoted they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of english kings theore he seems to me a very foolish man and truly wretched who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear alfred appears as a character in the twelfth  or thirteenth century poem  where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised  a thirteenth century work contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom name parker115

it was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base the jewel certainly dates from alfreds reign although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the æstels—pointers for reading—that alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the pastoral care each æstel was worth the princely sum of 50 es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the alfred jewel name lapidge203 
historian richard abels sees alfreds educational and military orms as complementary restoring religion and learning in wessex abels contends was to alfreds mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs as alfred observed in the pace to his english translation of gregory the greats pastoral care kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people pp 124–5  the pursuit of wisdom he assured his readers of the boethius was the surest path to power study wisdom then and when you have learned it condemn it not for i tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power yea even though not desiring itsedgefield wj king alfreds version of the consolations of boethius done into modern english 1900 p 35 
the portrayal of the west saxon resistance to the vikings by asser and the chronicler as a christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda it lected alfreds own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical christian world order in which god is the lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers the need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the common good led alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as offa as well as clerical writers such as bede alcuin and the other luminaries of the  this was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in alfreds worldview he believed as did other kings in ninth century england and francia that god had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people if the christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference he was answerable before god as josiah had been alfreds ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people
 wrote of alfred in his blockquotenow he was greatly loved more than all his brothers by his father and mother—indeed by everybody—with a universal and profound love and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else  he was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers and more pleasing in manner speech and behaviour  and in spite of all the demands of the present life it has been the desire for wisdom more than anything else together with the nobility of his birth which have characterized the nature of his noble mindkeynes simon and michael lapidge alfred the great assers  and other contemporary sources london penguin classics 1983 pages 74–75  blockquote
it is also written by asser that alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later which is described as shameful negligence of his parents and tutors it is true however that alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well a story is told by asser about how his mother held up a book of saxon poetry to him and his brothers and said i shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest after excitedly asking will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you alfred then took it to his teacher learned it and recited it back to his mother name keynes simon 1983 page 75keynes simon and lapidge p 75 
alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book probably an ancient version of a small pocket notebook which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected asser writes these he collected in a single book as i have seen for myself amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer and was inseparable from it name keynes simon 1983 page 75 
an excellent hunter in every branch of the sport alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody’s skills could compare name keynes simon 1983 page 75 
although he was the youngest of his brothers he was probably the most open minded despite eventually becoming one of the greatest warriors and forgers of peace in the kingdom he was an early advocate for education his desire for learning could have come from his early love of english poetry and inability to read or physically record them until later in life asser writes that alfred could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most namely the liberal arts for as he used to say there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the west saxons at that time name keynes simon 1983 page 75

alessandro algardi 31 july 1598  10 june 1654 was an  high  sculptor active almost exclusively in  where for the latter decades of his life he was along with  and  one of the major rivals of 
algardi was born in  where at a young age he was apprenticed in the studio of  however his aptitude for  led him to work for giulio cesare conventi 1577—1640 an artist of modest talents his two earliest known works date back to this period two statues of saints made of chalk in the oratory of santa maria della vita in bologna by the age of twenty  began commissioning works from him and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs after a short residence in  he went to rome in 1625 with an introduction from the duke of mantua to the  nephew cardinal  who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statuesthese restored statues still form the core of the bonacorsi ludovisi collection in  sculpture restoration was a common employment for even the most prominent sculptors of his day including bernini and  
propelled by the  and  patronage gian lorenzo bernini and his studio garnered most of the major roman sculptural commissions for nearly a decade algardi struggled for recognition in rome he was aided by friends that included  and his fellow bolognese  his early roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait bustshis marble bust of laudivio zacchia 1627 is in the staatliche museen berlin  http  wwwscultura italianacom galleria algardi%20alessandro imagepages image17html illustrated  while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes in the 1630s he worked on the tombs of the mellini family in the  in 
algardis first major commission came about in 1634 when cardinal ubaldini medici contracted for a funeral monument for his great uncle  the third of the  popes who had reigned for less than a month in 1605 the monument was started in 1640 and mostly completed by 1644 the arrangement mirrors the one designed by bernini for the tomb of  1628–47 with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing while at his feet two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus however in berninis tomb the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below wherein the figures of charity and justice are either distracted by putti or lost in contemplation while skeletal death actively writes the epitaph algardis tomb is much less dynamic the allegorical figures of magnanimity and liberality have an impassive ethereal dignity some have identified the helmeted figure of magnanimity with that of  and iconic images of wisdomharriet f senie the tomb of leo xi by alessandro algardi the art bulletin 1978 pp 90–95  liberality resembles  famous santa susanna but rendered more elegant the tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of urban viiis tombboucher pp 121–2 
in 1635–38  commissioned from algardi a colossal statue of  with kneeling angels for  completed in 1640bruce boucher earth and fire italian terracotta sculpture from donatello to canova yale university press 200147  immediately after this algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of  with two figures a kneeling resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword blow for the church of  these works established his reputation like berninis characteristic works they often express the baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions yet algardis sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival
with the death of the barberini  in 1644 and the accession of the   the barberini family and their favorite artist bernini fell into disrepute algardi on the other hand was embraced by the new popealgardis official 1645 portrait statue of innocent x is preserved in the  on the   and the popes nephew his portrait bust of camillo pamphili 1647 is at the  saint petersburg http  wwwscultura italianacom galleria algardi%20alessandro imagepages image2html illustration  algardis portraits were highly prized and their formal severity contrasts with berninis more vivacious expressionhttp  wwwmuseicapitoliniorg scripts schedaasplingua enampid mc1199  compare the prior images with berninis urban viii  a large hieratic bronze of innocent x by algardi is now to be found in the 
algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa the villa pamphili now  outside the porta san pancrazio in rome he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect engineer  and help with supervising its construction from his assistant montagu jennifer alessandro algardi vol 1 yale 1985 pp 94–6  the casino was a showcase for the pamphili collection of sculpture ancient and contemporary on which algardi was well able to advise in the villa grounds algardi and his studio executed sculpture encrusted fountains and other garden features where some of his free standing sculpture and bas reliefs remain
in 1650 algardi met  who obtained commissions for his work from  as a consequence there are four chimney pieces by algardi in the  and in the gardens the figures on the fountain of  are also by him the augustinian monastery at  contains the tomb of the count and countess de monterey another work by algardi
algardis large dramatic marble high relief panel of pope leo and attilahttp  wwwwgahu frames ehtml html a algardi 2 meetinghtml pope leo and atilla relief 164653 for  and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs there had been large marble reliefs used previously in roman churchesfor example gian lorenzos father s crowded assumption of the virgin for 1606  but for most patrons sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly in this relief the two principal figures the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened  surge forward from the center into three dimensions only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the popes defense while all others in the background reliefs persist in performing their respective earthly duties
the subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes leo with supernatural aid deterred the huns from looting rome from a  standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man no doubt part of his patrons message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies
algardi died in rome within a year of completing his famous relief which was admired by contemporaries
in his later years algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune algardis classicizing manner was carried on by pupils including  and   initially trained with him the latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the vision of saint nicholas  using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres other lesser known assistants from his studio include   and 
algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing  in a sober but immediate  and minute attention to costume and draperies such as in the busts of  camillo pamphilj and of muzio frangipane and his two sons lello and robertohttp  wwwromeartloverit algardihtml busts of algardis children 
in temperament his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of  than to the emotive works of other baroque artists from an artistic point of view he was most successful in portrait statues and groups of children where he was obliged to follow nature most closely his terracotta models some of them finished works of art were prized by collectorsan outstanding series of terracotta models is at the

the first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station aga located in the downtown area ultramodern the station intended to accommodate more than 80000 passengers per day will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit a shopping centre and three high rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project
the second project will not relate to the bay of algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front the development of the  sea front will include marinas channels luxury hotels offices apartments of great standing luxury stores and leisure amenities a crescent shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea the project of the bay of algiers will also comprise six small islands of which four of round form connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes
the third project will relate to restructuring an area of algiers qualified by the originators of the project of city of wellness el abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be agréable for all those which will want to combine tourism and wellbeing or tourism and relaxation the complex will include a university a research center and a medical centre it should also include a hospital complex a care centre a hotel zone an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments the university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students the university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences
another project relates to technological implantation of a campus in sidi abdellah  south east from algiers this  site will include shopping centres residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels two other residential zones including 1800 apartments and 40 high standard villas will be built on the surrounding hills
the fifth project is that of the tourist complex colonel abbès which will be located  west from algiers this complex will include several retail zones meeting places and residential zones composed of apartments and villas with views of the sea
currently there is another project under construction by the name of algers medina the first step of the project is nearly complete

one of the major scientific anniversaries that will be celebrated during the 2015  was the works on optics by ibn al haytham 1015
alhazens most famous work name khalilioptics  is his seven volume treatise on  kitab al manazir book of optics written from 1011 to 1021
optics was  by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century   it was printed by  in 1572 with the title opticae thesaurus alhazeni arabis libri septem nuncprimum editi eiusdem liber de crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus english  thesaurus of optics seven books of the arab alhazeni first edition concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds  risner is also the author of the name variant alhazen before risner he was known in the west as alhacen which is the correct transcription of the arabic name  this work enjoyed a great reputation during the  works by alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the  in  in 1834 by e a sedillot in all a mark smith has accounted for 18 full or near complete manuscripts and five fragments which are preserved in 14 locations including one in the  at  and one in the library of  
two major theories on vision prevailed in  the first theory the  was supported by such thinkers as  and  who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting  of  the second theory the intromission theory supported by  and his followers had physical forms entering the eye from an object previous islamic writers such as  had argued essentially on euclidean galenist or aristotelian lines the strongest influence on the book of optics was from ptolemys  while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on galens account  alhazens achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of euclid the medical tradition of  and the intromission theories of aristotle alhazens intromission theory followed al kindi and broke with aristotle in asserting that from each point of every colored body illuminated by any light issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point name lindberg 1976 73  this however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation in particular every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye what alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye name lindberg 1976 73  he attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly without being racted by any other part of the 
he argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board however a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off perpendicular rays were stronger than racted rays and the eye only perceive perpendicular rays as only one perpendicular ray entered the eye at any one point and all these rays converged on the centre of the eye in a cone this let resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye if only the perpendicular ray mattered then he had a one to one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved  he later asserted in book seven of the optics that other rays would be racted through the eye and perceived as if perpendicular 
his arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why only perpendicular rays were perceived why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly  his later argument that racted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive  however despite its weaknesses no other theory of the time was so comprehensive and it was enormously influential particularly in western europe directly or indirectly his de aspectibus inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries name lindberg 1976 86  s later theory of the l image which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye built directly on the conceptual framework of alhazen name lindberg 1976 86 
alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines and carried out various experiments with  s  and  name deek  he was the
first to consider separately the vertical and horizontal components of lected and racted light rays which was an important step in understanding optics geometrically 
the  was known to the  and was described by the  ic   in his scientific book  published in the year 1088 ce aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his problems however alhazens work also contained the first clear description outside of  of  in the areas of the    and  name kelley   and early analysis name wade   of the device
alhazen studied the process of sight the structure of the eye image formation in the eye and the  ian p howard argued in a 1996  article that alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to western europeans writing centuries later for example he described what became in the 19th century  he wrote a description of vertical s 600 years before  that is actually closer to the modern definition than aguiloniuss—and his work on  was repeated by panum in 1858 name howard  craig aaen stockdale while agreeing that alhazen should be credited with many advances has expressed some caution especially when considering alhazen in isolation from  who alhazen was extremely familiar with alhazen corrected a significant error of ptolemy regarding binocular vision but otherwise his account is very similar ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called herings law name aaenstockdale  in general alhazen built on and expanded the optics of ptolemy name wade 1998  name howard wade 1996  in a more detailed account of ibn al haythams contribution to the study of binocular vision based on lejeune name lejeune  and sabra name sabra  raynaud name raynaud  showed that the concepts of correspondence homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in ibn al haythams optics but contrary to howard he explained why ibn al haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why by reasoning experimentally he was in fact closer to the discovery of panums fusional area than that of the vieth müller circle in this regard ibn al haythams theory of binocular vision faced two main limits the lack of recognition of the role of the retina and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts
alhazens most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical systemgul a russell emergence of physiological optics p 691 in   his understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye name russell 689gul a russell emergence of physiological optics p 689 in   which he sought to avoid  he maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens or glacial humor as he called it were further racted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye   he followed  in believing that the  was the receptive organ of sight although some of his work hints that he thought the  was also involved 
alhazens synthesis of light and vision adhered to the aristotelian scheme exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical complete fashionhttp  wwwjstororg stable 3657357seq 104ampsearch yesampresultitemclick trueampsearchtext childampsearchtext doesampsearchuri %2faction%2fdobasicsearch%3fquery%3dchild%2bdoes%26amp%3bfilter%3diid%253a102307%252fi370516#page_scan_tab_contents de aspectibus book two 339 p437 via jstor 
an aspect associated with alhazens optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation itibararabic إعتبار and  in his scientific inquiries  moreover his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics ilm tabii with mathematics taalim geometry in particular this mathematical physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in kitab al manazir the optics de aspectibus or perspectivae and grounded his theories of vision light and colour as well as his research in catoptrics and  the study of the raction of light name bizri 2005 br        in his book ibn al haytham first scientist has argued that alhazens approach to testing and experimentation made an important contribution to the scientific method   
according to matthias schramm alhazen was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light spot formed by the projection of the  through two small  onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up name toomer 463 4  g j toomer expressed some skepticism regarding schramms view arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in alhazens very large body of work and while acknowledging alhazens importance in developing experimental techniques argued that he should not be considered in isolation from other islamic and ancient thinkers 
mark smiths critical editions of de aspectibus contain a latin glossary with page numbers of each occurrence of the words to illustrate alhazens experimental viewpoint smith shows that alhacen was received well in the west because he reinforced the importance of the hellenic tradition to them    
his work on  in book v of the book of optics contains a discussion of what is now known as alhazens problem first formulated by  in 150 ad it comprises drawing lines from two points in the  of a circle meeting at a point on the  and making equal angles with the  at that point this is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular  at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point thus its main application in optics is to solve the problem given a light source and a spherical mirror find the point on the mirror where the light will be lected to the eye of an observer this leads to an  name mactutor   this eventually led alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of s where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated his method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers although he did not himself do this perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in he used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an  where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a  name katz  alhazen eventually solved the problem using s and a geometric proof his solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in latin translation later mathematicians used  analytical methods to analyse the problem name smith  with a new solution being found in 1997 by the oxford mathematician   recently  merl researchers amit agrawal yuichi taguchi and srikumar ramalingam solved the extension of alhazens problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic parabolic and elliptical mirrors  they showed that the mirror lection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case if the camera eye is placed on the axis of the mirror the degree of the equation reduces to six name agrawaleccv10  alhazens problem can also be extended to multiple ractions from a spherical ball given a light source and a spherical ball of certain ractive index the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is racted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation name agrawaleccv10 
 has noted that alhazens treatment of raction describes an experimental setup without publication of data note 67 is on p361 333 is the summary of how to measure the sizes of the angle of raction for air to water air to glass glass to air glass to water for plane concave and convex surfaces  ptolemy published his experimental results for raction in contrast one generation before alhazen  discovered his statement of the lengths of the hypotenuse for each incident and racted right triangle respectively this is equivalent to descartes formulation for raction alhazens convention for describing the incident and racted angles is still in use his failure to publish his data is an open question
the kitab al manazir book of optics describes several experimental observations that alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies he conducted experiments with s and concluded that only the impact of  projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate whereas surfaces tended to deflect  projectile strikes for example to explain raction from a rare to a dense medium he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet a perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not name russellgul a russell emergence of physiological optics p 695 in   
he also used this result to explain how intense direct light hurts the eye using a mechanical analogy alhazen associated strong lights with perpendicular rays and weak lights with oblique ones the obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye name russell  
sudanese psychologist omar khaleefa has argued that alhazen should be considered the founder of  for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and s name khaleefa  khaleefa has also argued that alhazen should also be considered the founder of  a sub discipline and precursor to modern psychology name khaleefa  although alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed name aaenstockdale 
alhazen offered an explanation of the  an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval europeross he and plug c 2002 the mystery of the moon illusion exploring size perception oxford oxford university press  many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky a debate that is still unresolved alhazen argued against ptolemys raction theory and defined the problem in terms of perceived rather than real enlargement he said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer when the moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects so the moon appears close the perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance theore the moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky and further and larger on the horizon through works by   and witelo based on alhazens explanation the moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon with the raction theory being rejected in the 17th century  although alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation he was not the first author to offer it   2nd century gave this account in addition to raction and he credited it to   135 50 bc  ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his optics but the text is obscure  alhazens writings were more widely available in the middle ages than those of these earlier authors and that probably explains why alhazen received the credit
besides the book of optics alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject including his risala fi l daw’ treatise on light he investigated the properties of  the  s twilight and  experiments with mirrors and  provided the foundation for his theories on  name bizri 
alhazen discussed the  of the celestial region in his epitome of astronomy arguing that ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where for example none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other the suggestion of mechanical models for the earth centred  greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the ptolemaic system among the christians of the west alhazens determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important however because it meant astronomical hypotheses were accountable to the  and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms 
he also wrote maqala fi daw al qamar on the light of the moon
in his work alhazen discussed theories on the  of a body name bizri  in his treatise on place alhazen disagreed with s view that nature abhors a void and he used  in an attempt to demonstrate that place al makan is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body name bizri 2007 
    anchor for a wikilink in celestial spheres article please do not remove or rename without making the appropriate amendments to that article    
in his on the configuration of the world alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth
the book is a non technical explanation of ptolemys  which was eventually translated into  and  in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as  name britannica  during the european  and   
in his al shukūk ‛alā batlamyūs variously translated as doubts concerning ptolemy or aporias against ptolemy published at some time between 1025 and 1028 alhazen criticized s almagest planetary hypotheses and optics pointing out various contradictions he found in these works particularly in astronomy ptolemys almagest concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets whereas the hypotheses concerned what ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error but alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in ptolemys works name sabra 1998  he considered that some of the mathematical devices ptolemy introduced into astronomy especially the  failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points lines and circles 
having pointed out the problems alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in ptolemy in a later work alhazen believed there was a true configuration of the planets that ptolemy had failed to grasp he intended to complete and repair ptolemys system not to replace it completely name sabra 1998  in the doubts concerning ptolemy alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories
he held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge
alhazens the model of the motions of each of the seven planets was written  1038 only one damaged manuscript has been found with only the introduction and the first section on the theory of planetary motion surviving there was also a second section on astronomical calculation and a third section on astronomical instruments following on from his doubts on ptolemy alhazen described a new geometry based planetary model describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry he kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular which required the inclusion of  to explain observed motion but he managed to eliminate ptolemys  in general his model didnt try to provide a causal explanation of the motions but concentrated on providing a complete geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in ptolemys model name harv rashed 2007 
alhazen wrote a total of twenty five astronomical works some concerning technical issues such as exact determination of the meridian a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the  alhazen argued for a distant location based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars  the fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory including the doubts and model of the motions discussed above name rashed 2007 8–9 
in  alhazen built on the mathematical works of  and  and worked on the beginnings of the link between  and  name faruqi
 
he developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers using a geometric proof to prove the formula chapter 1 
alhazen explored what is now known as the   the fifth  in  using a   and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry   he formulated the  which boris abramovich rozenfeld names the ibn al haytham–lambert quadrilateral name rozenfeld  his theorems on s including the lambert quadrilateral were the first theorems on  and  these theorems along with his alternative postulates such as playfairs axiom can be seen as marking the beginning of  his work had a considerable influence on its development among the later persian geometers  and  and the european geometers   and  name rozenfeld youschkevitch  
in elementary geometry alhazen attempted to solve the problem of  using the area of s crescent shapes but later gave up on the impossible task name mactutor  the two lunes formed from a  by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangles sides inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides are known as the  they have the same total area as the triangle itself 
alhazens contributions to  include his work on s in his analysis and synthesis he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2supn−1 sup2supn supampnbsp−ampnbsp1 where 2supn supampnbsp−ampnbsp1 is  but he was not able to prove this result  later proved it in the 18th century name mactutor 
alhazen solved problems involving  using what is now called  in his opuscula alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences and gives two general methods of solution his first method the canonical method involved wilsons theorem while his second method involved a version of the  name mactutor 
alhazen also wrote a treatise on the influence of melodies on the souls of animals although no copies have survived it appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace
in  one account of his career as a  has him summoned to egypt by the fatimid   to regulate the  of the  river he carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual  of the nile river and he drew plans for building a  at the site of the modern day  his field work however later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme and he soon  so he could avoid punishment from the caliph pt ii p 459 
in his treatise on place alhazen disagreed with s view that nature abhors a  and he used  in an attempt to demonstrate that place al makan is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body name bizri 2007   a supporter of aristotles philosophical view of place later criticized the work in fi al radd ‘ala ibn al haytham fi al makan a utation of ibn al haytham’s place for its geometrization of place name bizri 2007 
alhazen also discussed  and its  implications in his  in tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and theore the autonomy of vision without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation sight can tell us next to nothing about such things 
alhazen was a devout  though it is uncertain which branch of  he followed he may have been either a follower of the  school of   according to  name sardar 1998  and lawrence bettany name bettany 251  and opposed to the views of the  school name bettany 251  a follower of the mutazili school of islamic theology according to peter edward hodgson name hodgson 2006 53  or a possibly follower of  according to  name referencea  
alhazen wrote a work on islamic theology in which he discussed hood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time pt ii p 464  he also wrote a treatise entitled finding the direction of qibla by calculation in which he discussed finding the  where  prayers are directed towards mathematically name topdemir 
he wrote in his doubts concerning ptolemy
in the winding motion alhazen further wrote
alhazen described his theology
according to medieval biographers alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known most of his works are now lost but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics 23 of them are on astronomy and 14 of them are on optics with a few on other subjects name rashed  not all his surviving works have yet been studied but some of the ones that have are given below name rashed 2007 8–9  name topdemir

alessandro di cristofano di lorenzo del bronzino allori florence 31 may 1535 – 22 september 1607 was an  portrait  of the late   school
in 1540 after the death of his father he was brought up and trained in art by a close friend often erred to as his uncle the mannerist painter  whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures in some ways allori is the last of the line of prominent florentine painters of generally undiluted tuscan artistic heritage  worked with  as well as   briefly worked under andrea and trained  who trained allori subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of  styles pre eminent in other parts of italy
freedberg derides allori as derivative claiming  he illustrates the ideal of maniera by which art and style are generated out of pre existing art the polish of figures has an unnatural marble like form as if he aimed for cold statuary it can be said of late phase mannerist painting in florence that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like  and  was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting while by 1600 the baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures florence was painting two dimensional statues furthermore in general with the exception of the counter maniera  artists it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion

the almoravids  imṛabḍen  al murābiṭūn were a   of g stewart is the caliph a pope in the muslim world volume 21 issue 2 pages 185–196 april 1931 the almoravid dynasty among the berbers of north africa founded a considerable empire
morocco being the result of their conquests sadiqi fatima the place of berber in morocco international journal of the sociology of language 1231 2009 7 22  the almoravids were the first relatively recent berber dynasty that ruled morocco the leaders of this dynasty came from the moroccan deep south  who formed an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western  and  founded by  their capital was  a city they founded in 1062 the dynasty originated among the  and the gudala nomadic berber tribes of the  traversing the territory between the  the  and the  riversextract from http  wwwuniversalisfr encyclopedie a912241 almoravideshtm encyclopedia universalis on almoravids 
the almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of  to the iberian christian kingdoms when they decisively defeated a coalition of the  and  armies at the  in 1086 this enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3000 kilometers north to south however the rule of the dynasty was relatively short lived the almoravids fell — at the height of their power — when they failed to quell the  led rebellion initiated by  as a result their last king  was killed in marrakesh in april 1147 by the s who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in morocco and 
the term almoravid comes from the arabic al murabitun  which is the plural form of al murabit — literally meaning one who is tying but figuratively meaning one who is ready for battle at a fortress the term is related to the notion of  a frontier monastery fortress through the root r b t  rabat to tie to unite or  raabat to encampnehemia levtzion abd allah b yasin and the almoravids in john ralph willis studies in west african islamic history  p 54 p f de moraes farias the almoravids some questions concerning the character of the movement bulletin de l’ifan series b 29 3 4 794 878 1967 
another theory states that the name almoravid comes from a school of malikite law called dar al murabitin founded in  modern day morocco by a certain scholar named https  bewleyvirtualavenet ibnyasinhtml wajjaj ibn zalwi ibn zalwi was responsible for sending his student abd allah ibn yasin to preach malikite islam to the sanhaja berbers of western sahara hence the name of the almoravids comes from the followers of the dar al murabitin the house of those who were bound together in the cause of god messier ronald a the almoravids and the meanings of jihad santa barbara ca praeger publishers 2010 
it is uncertain exactly when or why the almoravids acquired that appellation  writing in 1068 before their apex already calls them the al murabitun but does not clarify the reasons for it writing three centuries later  suggested it was chosen early on by abdallah ibn yasin  because upon finding resistance among the gudala berbers of adrar mauritania to his teaching he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ribat monastery fortress on an offshore island possibly  island in ibn abi zars account is translated in n levtzion and j f p hopkins eds 2000 corpus of early arabic sources for west african history university of ghanapp 239ff for tentative identification of the ribat see moraes farias 1967   wrote that the name was suggested by ibn yasin in the persevering in the fight sense to boost morale after a particularly hard fought battle in the  valley c 1054 in which they had taken many losses whichever explanation is true it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the almoravids for themselves partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications
the name might be related to the ribat of  in the village of aglu near present day  where the future almoravid spiritual leader abdallah ibn yasin got his initial training the 13th century moroccan biographer  and  before him in the 12th century note that waggags learning center was called dar al murabitin the house of the almoravids and that might have inspired ibn yasins choice of name for the movement  
contemporaries frequently erred to them as the al mulathimun the veiled ones from litham  for veil the almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes see  a custom they adapted from southern  berbers this can still be seen among the modern  but it was unusual further north although practical for the desert dust the almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere as a badge of foreignness in urban settings partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials it served as the uniform of the almoravids  under their rule s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class in turn the succeeding  made a point of mocking the almoravid veil as symbolic of  and decadence
the s of the  in the early middle ages could be roughly classified into three major groups the  across the north the  concentrated in central morocco and the  clustered in two areas the western part of the  and the hills of the eastern maghreb  mones 1988 p 119 1992 p 228  the eastern sanhaja included the  berbers who had been the base of the  rise in the early 10th century and the  who ruled  as vassals of the fatimids after the latter moved to egypt in 972 the western sanhaja were divided into several tribes the gazzula and the  in the  and the foothills of the  range further south encamped in the western  were the massufa the  and the banu warith and most southerly of all the gudala or judala in littoral  down to the borderlands of the 
the western sanhaja had been converted to  some time in the 9th century they were subsequently united in the 10th century and with the zeal of neophyte converts launched several campaigns against the ese pagan peoples of lewicki 1988 pp 160 61 1992 pp 308 09  under their king tinbarutan ibn usfayshar the sanhaja lamtuna erected or captured the citadel of  a critical stop on the  route after the collapse of the sanhaja union awdagust passed over to the  and the trans saharan routes were taken over by the   of  the maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the sanhaja gazzula and lamta out of their pasturelands in the sous and draa valleys around 1035 the lamtuna chieftain abu abdallah muhammad ibn tifat alias tarsina tried to reunite the sanhaja desert tribes but his reign lasted less than three years
around 1040  a chieftain of the gudala and brother in law of the late tarsina went on  to  on his return he stopped by  in  where he met  a native of  and a jurist and scholar of the   school at this time ifriqiya was in ferment the  ruler  was openly contemplating breaking with his   overlords in cairo and the jurists of kairouan were agitating for him to do so within this heady atmosphere yahya and abu imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands and yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of  among his southern sanhaja people with abu imrans recommendation yahya ibn ibrahim made his way to the ribat of waggag ibn zelu in the  valley of southern morocco to seek out a maliki teacher for his people waggag assigned him one of his residents 
abdallah ibn yasin was a gazzula berber and probably a convert rather than a born muslim his name can be read as son of  the title of the 36th  of the  suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was re born of the holy bookm brett and e fentress 1996 the berbers oxford blackwell p 100 revealingly the 36th sura begins the salutation you are one of messengers and the imperative duty to set people on the straight path ibn yasins choice of name was probably not a coincidence  ibn yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the  and the  name shilling88   chroniclers such as al bakri allege ibn yasins learning was superficial ibn yasins initial meetings with the gudala people went poorly as he had more ardor than depth ibn yasins arguments were disputed by his audience he responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations the gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector yahya ibn ibrahim sometime in the 1040s
ibn yasin however found a more favorable reception among the neighboring lamtuna people name shilling88  probably sensing the useful organizing power of ibn yasins pious fervor the lamtuna chieftain  invited the man to preach to his people the lamtuna leaders however kept ibn yasin on a caul leash forging a more productive partnership between them invoking stories of the early life of muhammad ibn yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to islamicization that it was not enough to merely adhere to gods law but necessary to also destroy opposition to it in ibn yasins ideology anything and everything outside of islamic law could be characterized as opposition he identified tribalism in particular as an obstacle he believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences and embrace the equality of all muslims under the sacred law it was necessary to make them do so for the lamtuna leadership this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to ound the sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions in the early 1050s the lamtuna under the joint leadership of yahya ibn umar and abdallah ibn yasin — soon calling themselves the al murabitin almoravids — set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause
from the year 1053 the almoravids began to spread their religious way to the berber areas of the sahara and to the regions south of the desert after winning over the  berber tribe they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route seizing  at the northern end in 1054 and  at the southern end in 1055 yahya ibn umar was killed in a battle in 1057 name shilling90shillington p 90  but abdullah ibn yasin whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount named his brother  as chief under him the almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert and conquered the tribes of the  they then came in contact with the  a berber tribal confederation who followed a heresy founded by  three centuries earlier the berghouata resisted and it was in battle with them that abdullah ibn yasin was killed in 1059 in a village called krifla located near  morocco they were however completely conquered by  and adopted islam as a religion abu bakr married a noble and wealthy berber woman  who  would become very influential in the development of the dynasty name zar87  zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from houara who is said to be from  in origin name zar87

yusuf ibn tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as morocco  and  into complete subjection in 1062 he founded the city of  in 1080 he conquered the kingdom of  in modern day  and founded the present city of that name his rule extending as far east as  name br1911 
according to arab tradition the almoravids conquered the  sometime around 1075 cemuslim societies in african history new approaches to african history david robinson  which example was displayed by the record of historian  through the  of ghana shaykh uthman in 1394 that almoravid movement weakened ghana to the extent that the authority of the rulers of ghana dwindled away and they were overcome by the  a neighboring people of the sudan who subjugated and absorbed themibn khaldun in levtzion and hopkins eds and transl corpus p 333   traditions in mali related that the soso attacked and took over mali as well and the ruler of the soso sumaouro kanté took over the landnehemia levtzion ancient ghana and mali new york 1973 pp 51 2 58 60 
however criticism from conrad and fisher 1982 argued that the notion of any almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on arabic sources furthermore according to the archaeology research from professor timothy insoll of ancient ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any almoravid era military conquests
dierke lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesnt preclude almoravid political agitation claiming that the main factor of the demise of ghana empire owed much to the latter according to lange the almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife there the almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nations nobility scholars such as dierk lange attribute the decline of ancient ghana to numerous unrelated factors only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by almoravid influence and islamic pressures but devoid of any military conversion and conquestlange dierk 1996 the almoravid expansion and the downfall of ghana der islam 73 pp 122 59 
this interpretation of events was disputed by later scholars like sheril burkhalater who argued that whatever the nature of the conquest in the south the influence and success of the almoravids in securing west africa gold  and curcylating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control the ensuing war pushed ghana over the edge ending the kingdoms position as a commercial and military power by 1100 it collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies some of which later assimilated into the almoravids while others founded the  sheryl burkhalter suggests that the almoravid who led the expedition to conquer ghana was none other abu bakr’s son yahyalistening for silences in almoravid history another reading of “the conquest thatnever was”  sheryl l burkhalter

the age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be  to consent to  and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity the distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner as the offender
the term age of consent rarely actually appears in legal s name waites  it has sometimes been used with other meanings such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to oxford english dictionary entry for age of consent  but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood it should not be confused with the   the  the  the  etc
age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction name waites   though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18 the laws may also vary by the type of sexual act the gender of the participants or other restrictions such as abuse of a  some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other rather than a single age charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a  such as corruption of a minor to what is popularly called  which is considered equivalent to  both in severity and sentencing
there are many grey areas in this area of law some regarding unspecific and untried legislation others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes and others due to conflicts between  and  laws these factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject and a topic of highly charged debates name waites  
in traditional societies the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide or a tribal custom in most cases this coincided with signs of   for a woman and pubic hair for a man name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent  the ancient greek poet  in  c 700 bc suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty
reliable data for when people would actually marry is difficult to find in england for example the only reliable data on age at marriage in the early modern period comes from records involving those who left property after their death not only were the records relatively rare but not all bothered to record the participants ages and it seems that the more complete the records are the more likely they are to reveal young marriages additionally 20th  and 21st century historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept data regarding young ages of marriage and instead explain the data away as a misreading by a later copier of the records name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent 
in the 12th century  the influential founder of  in  europe accepted age of puberty for marriage to be between 12 and 14 but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than 7  there were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty or if they had already consummated the marriage it should be noted that judges honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger thanampnbsp7 in spite of what gratian had said there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent 
the first recorded age of consent law dates from 1275 in england as part of the  law a statute westminster 1 made it a misdemeanor to ravish a maiden within age whether with or without her consent the phrase within age was interpreted by jurist sir edward coke as meaning the age of marriage which at the time was 12 years of age name stephen robertson university of sydney australia 
the american colonies followed the english tradition and the law was more of a guide for example mary hathaway virginia 1689 was only 9 when she was married to william williams sir edward coke england 17th century made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a  from her husbands estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent 
in the 16th century a small number of italian and german states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls setting it at 12 years towards the end of the 18th century other european countries also began to enact similar laws the first french constitution of 1791 established the minimum age at 11 years portugal spain denmark and the swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at 10–12 years name chnmgmuedu 
age of consent laws were historically difficult to follow and enforce legal norms based on age were not in general common until the 19th century because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable name chnmgmuedu 
in  societies  was forbidden however older children were often punished themselves as being complicit in the sexual interaction with the adult until the late 18th century there was little understanding of  as a concept and children were often seen as little adults indeed prior to the 12th century there was virtually no notion of childhood at all christianity also deemed that children were born into the  and as such were perceived as inherently immoral name autogenerated1  children had very few rights and were considered the  of the father  high rates of  also meant that parents emotionally distanced themselves from their children name zelizer2010  from the late 18th century and especially in the 19th century attitudes started to change by the mid 19th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse name autogenerated1 
a general great shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex took place in the modern era and beliefs on the appropriate age below which girls should not be permitted to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood while ages from 10 to 13 were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in  during the mid 19th century name waites   by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent name stephen robertson university of sydney australia 
the english  had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of 10 to 12 but in 1875 the age was raised to 13 after intense sensational media revelations about the scourge of under age prostitution in london in the 1880s caused respectable middle class outrage the age of consent was raised to 16 in 1885 early feminists of the social purity movement such as  and others instrumental in securing the repeal of the  began to turn towards the problem of  by the end of the 1870s
the investigative journalist  of the  was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the london underworld through a publicity stunt in 1885 he purchased one victim  the 13 year old daughter of a  for £5 and took her to a brothel where she was drugged he then published a series of four exposés entitled  which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction procurement and sale of young english virgins to continental pleasure palaces the maiden tribute was an instant hit with the public victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution fearing riots on a national scale the   pleaded in vain with stead to cease publication of the articles a wide variety of orm groups held protest meetings and marched together to  demanding that the age of consent be raised the government was forced to pass the  that raised the age of consent to 16 and clamped down on prostitution 
in the united states as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at 10–12 in delaware it wasampnbsp7 in 1895  inspired by the maiden tribute female ormers in the us initiated their own campaigndelinquent daughters policing and protecting adolescent female sexuality in the united states 1885 1920 by mary odem chapel hill university of north carolina press 1995 isbn 978 0807863671  which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at leastampnbsp16 with the ultimate goal to raise the age to 18 the campaign was successful with almost all states raising the minimum age to 16–18 years by 1920 name stephen robertson university of sydney australia   
in  portugal denmark and the swiss cantons and other countries the minimum age was raised to between 13 and 16 years in the following decades name stephen robertson university of sydney australia  though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality since then the raison dêtre of the laws has changed to  and a so called right to childhood or innocencethe emergence of a new taboo the desexualization of youth in western societies since 1800 by martin killias european journal on criminal policy and research vol8 2000 issn 0928 1371

in the 21st century concerns about  and  of children gained international prominence and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions as well as in the adoption of several international instruments
the    25 october 2007 and the s directive 2011 92 eu of the european parliament and of the council of 13 december 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography  were adopted
the  came into force in 2002
the  which came into force in 2003 prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children 
the  which came into force in 2008 also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children
several western countries have raised their ages of consent recently these include  in 2008   from 14 to 16 and in europe  in 2007   from 14 to 15  in 2010   from 14 to 16  in 2013   from 14 to 15 and  in 2015   from 13 to 16
the international criminal court statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape sexual violence statute but makes erence to sexual acts committed against persons incapable of giving genuine consent and the explicative footnote states it is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural induced or age related incapacity see note 51 
sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a  in most countries jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense including   illegal  corruption of a minor name waites   besides others
the enforcement practices of age of consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture see above often enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor eg a teacher minister or doctor the  of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individuals guilt and theore enforcement name waites  
the threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions  most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent name soa2003  however some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after their  such as the state of  in  and  but only in marriage ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used such as the   how  in  are handled or even the method by which  date is calculated 
the age of consent is a legal barrier to the minors ability to consent and theore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age for example
 reasonable belief that the victim is over the age of consent in some jurisdictions such as  name soa2003  it is a defense if the accused can show that he or she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of consent however where such a defense is provided it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show  in determining the age of the victim eg a 15 year old who used a fake identification document claiming to be 18 or older 
 marriage in most jurisdictions age of consent laws do not apply if the parties are legally married to each other
  some jurisdictions have laws explicitly allowing sexual acts with minors under the age of consent if their partner is close in age to them for instance in  the age of consent is 16 but there are two close in age exemptions sex with minors aged 14–15 is permitted if the partner is less than five years older and sex with minors aged 12–13 is permitted if the partner is less than two years older  other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of a similar age and development for instance the age of consent in  is 16 but the law states that the act will not be punished if there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved  another approach takes the form of a stipulation that sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed a certain age for example the age of consent in the us state of  is 18 but it is allowed for teenagers aged 16 and 17 to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than 30  in  the age of consent in 15 but the law requires that there is a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim 
 homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies some jurisdictions such as     and  have a higher age of consent for  sexual activity in both the united kingdom and western australia for example the age of consent was originally 21 for same sex sexual activity between males with no laws regarding  sexual activities while it was 16 for  sexual activity this is no longer the casethe causes and cures of criminality eysenck hans 1989 plenum press new york page 229  however such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged in both  and the n state of  the age of consent for  is officially higher at 18 years compared with 16 years for vaginal and oral sex name can  name aust  in the canadian provinces of   and  this discrepancy has been declared unconstitutional by courts  
 gender age differentials in some jurisdictions such as  name indonesia  there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity that are based on the gender of each person in countries where there are gender age differentials the age of consent may be higher for girls—for example in  where the age of consent for heterosexual sex is 16 for girls and 14 for boys  or they may be higher for males such as in indonesia where males must be 19 years old and females must be 16 years old name indonesia   there are also numerous jurisdictions—such as kuwait name kuwait  and  name palestine —in which  govern the gender age differential in these jurisdictions it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage so the de facto age of consent is the marriageable age in kuwait this means that boys must be at least 17 and girls at least 15 years old
 position of authority trust in most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below 18 such as england and wales name soa2003_a  in cases where a person aged 18 or older is in a position of trust over a person under 18 the age of consent usually rises to 18 or higher examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students for example in england and wales the age of consent is 16 but if the person is a student of the older person it becomesampnbsp18
some countries have age of consent laws which apply not only to acts committed within the country but also to those committed by its citizens or inhabitants while they are on foreign soil name waites   for example a federal united states law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with us citizens from another state if the partner is under 18 and the activity is illegal under the federal state or local law this applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the united states or from one state into another for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter  name solr 
there is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter in law or in practice traditionally age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls name chnmgmuedu  many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender rather than dealing with concerns of chastity this has led to gender neutral laws in many jurisdictions name chnmgmuedu  on the other hand there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an unequal act for males and females due to issues such as pregnancy increased risk of stdsunfpa writes that biologically womens risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of menhttp  wwwunfpaorg resources giving special attention girls and adolescents  and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready in the us in  it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because the equal protection clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded 
traditionally many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys the latter acts often falling under  and  laws this means that in some legal systems women having sexual contact with underage youth were rarely acknowledged for example until 2000 in the uk before the  there was no statutory age of consent for  sex  in  before 2005 there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boysin respect of sexual conduct with a young person aged under 16 the bill crimes amendment bill no 2 which became law in 2005 http  wwwparliamentnz en nz pb legislation bills 00dbhoh_bill5923_1 crimes amendment bill no 2 significantly toughens the law the loophole protecting women against being charged with sexual offending against children is removedhttp  wwwparliamentnz en nz pb debates debates 47hansd_20050414_00000206 crimes amendment bill no 2 %e2%80%94 second reading instruction  situations like these have been attributed to societal views on traditional  and to constructs of  and  according to e martellozzo viewing females as perpetrators of sexual abuse goes against every stereotype that society has of women women as mothers and caregivers and not as people who abuse and harm   argues that women are not acknowledged as perpetrators of sex crimes because society does not accept that women have an autonomous sexuality of their own

amalric of bena   died  1204 1207 ad was a   and  leader after whom the  are named
amalric was born in the latter part of the 12th century at bennes a village between  and  in the 
amalric taught philosophy and theology at the  and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle ian his lectures developing the  attracted a large circle of hearers  in 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university and on a personal appeal to  the sentence was ratified amalric being ordered to return to paris and recant his errors
his death was caused it is said by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected
in 1209 ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of paris and amalrics own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds  the doctrines of his followers known as the s were formally condemned by the  in 1215
amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from  whose principles he developed in a one sided and strongly ic form
three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him
#that god is all omnia sunt deus and thus all things are one because whatever is is god omnia unum quia quidquid est est deus
#that every christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of christ and that this belief is necessary for salvation
#that he who remains in love of god can commit no sin
because of the first proposition god himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation
these three propositions were further developed by his followers who maintained that god revealed himself in a threefold revelation the first in the biblical patriarch  marking the epoch of the father the second in  who began the epoch of the son and the third in amalric and his disciples who inaugurated the era of the 
amalricians taught
hell is ignorance theore hell is within all men like a bad tooth in a mouth
god is identical with all that is even evil belongs to god and proves gods omnipotence
a man who knows that god works through everything cannot sin because every human act is then the act of god
a man who recognizes the truth that god works through everything is already in heaven and this is the only resurrection  there is no other life mans fulfilment is in this life alone
due to persecutions this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder not long after the burning of ten of their members 1210 the sect itself lost its importance while some of the surviving amalricians became http  wwwpinselparkorg geschichte einzel p0375_mittelalter r_haeresiehtml german

the portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between galicia and portugal and rallied around the infant afonso  the archbishop of braga was also concerned with the dominance of galicia apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the galician archbishop of santiago de compostela diego gelmírez who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of saint james in his town as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the iberian peninsula in 1122 afonso turned fourteen the adult age in the 12th century he made himself a  on his own account in the  raised an army and proceeded to take control of his mothers lands

afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the moors in the south his campaigns were successful and on 25 july 1139 he obtained an overwhelming victory in the  and straight after was unanimously proclaimed king of the portuguese by his soldiers establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the peninsula the first assembly of the estates general convened at  wherein he would have been given the crown from the archbishop of braga to confirm his independence is a 17th century embellishment of portuguese history
independence from alfonso vii of leóns  however was not a thing he just could achieve militarily the county of portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and most importantly by the  and the  afonso wed  daughter of  and sent ambassadors to rome to negotiate with the pope he succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin alfonso vii of león becoming instead a vassal of the papacy as the kings of sicily and aragon had done before him in 1179 the bull  accepted the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively
in portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders he is notably the builder of  to which he called the  of his uncle  of  in 1143 he wrote to  to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church swearing to pursue driving the moors out of the iberian peninsula bypassing any king of león afonso declared himself the direct  of the papacy afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the moors from whom he wrested  see  and  in 1147 see  he also conquered an important part of the land south of the  river although this was lost again to the moors in the following years
meanwhile king alfonso vii of león afonsos cousin regarded the independent ruler of portugal as nothing but a rebel conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years afonso became involved in a war taking the side of the aragonese king an enemy of castile to ensure the alliance his son  was engaged to  sister of the  and infanta of aragon finally after winning the  the  established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the kingdom of león that portugal was a sovereign kingdom

in 1179 the privileges and favours given to the roman catholic church were compensated in the     acknowledged afonso as king and portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the moors with this papal blessing portugal was at last secured as a kingdom

afonso ii  english alphonzo or affonso archaic portuguese alfonso or alphonso  or alphonsus  version nicknamed the fat  o gordo  was born in  on 23 april 1185 and died on 25 march 1223 in the same city he was the second but eldest surviving son of  by his wife  infanta of  afonso succeeded his father in 1212
as a king afonso ii set a different approach of government hitherto his father sancho i and his grandfather  were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring  or against the  lands in the south afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with castile during his reign despite this some towns like  in 1217 were conquered from the moors by the private initiative of noblemen this does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man the first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between afonso and his brothers and sisters the king managed to keep security within portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin
since military issues were not a government priority afonso established the states administration and centralized power on himself he designed the first set of portuguese written laws these were mainly concerned with  civil justice and  afonso also sent ambassadors to european kingdoms outside the  and began amicable commercial relations with most of them
other orms included the always delicate matters with the pope in order to get the independence of portugal recognized by rome his grandfather afonso i had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the church these eventually created a state within the state with portugals position as a country firmly established afonso ii endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the  to purposes of national utility these actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and portugal after being  for his audacities by  afonso ii promised to make amends to the church but he died in 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so

alfonso was acknowledged as a king by charlemagne and the pope and asturias as a kingdom for the first time the king showed an interest in the frankish cult of saint martin of tours and most notably he encouraged carolingian church influence into asturias not surprisingly during alfonsos reign the alleged resting place of st james was revealed alfonsos envoys to charlemagnes courts may have also dealt with the  controversy which had brought bermudos kingdom into charlemagnes view it seems that carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into andalusian territory up to  the andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798

alfonso xii alfonso francisco de asís fernando pío juan maría de la concepción gregorio pelayo 28 november 1857 – 25 november 1885 was  reigning from 1874 to 1885 after a coup détat restored the monarchy and ended the ephemeral 
having been forced into exile after the  deposed his mother  from the throne in 1868 alfonso studied in  and  his mother abdicated in his favour in 1870 and he returned to spain as king in 1874 following a military coup alfonso died aged 27 in 1885 and was succeeded by his unborn son who became  on his birth the following year
alfonso was born in  as the eldest son of  officially his father was her husband  alfonsos biological paternity is uncertain there is speculation that his biological father may have been enrique puigmoltó y mayans a captain of the guardjuan sisinio pérez garzón isabel ii los espejos de la reina 2004  these rumours were used as political propaganda against alfonso by the 
his mothers accession created the second cause of instability which was the carlist wars the supporters of the  as king of spain rose to have him enthroned in addition within the context of the post napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the west both in europe and the americas both the carlistas as well as the isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new napoleonic constitutional system much like in britain which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the traditional spanish organic laws such as the  the novísima recopilación and the  this led to the third cause of instability of note the independence of the american kingdoms recognized between 1823 and 1850
when queen isabella and her husband were forced to leave spain by the  alfonso accompanied them to paris from there he was sent to the  at  to continue his studies on 25 june 1870 he was recalled to paris where his mother abdicated in his favour in the presence of a number of spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen he assumed the title of alfonso xii for although no king of united spain had borne the name alfonso xi the spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of   and  also named 
after amadeos abandonment in 1873 parliament declared the federal republic including cuba puerto rico and the pacific archipelagos the first act of president estanislao figueras was to extend the abolition act to puerto rico cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889
but the republicans were not in agreement either and they had to contend with the war in cuba and muslim uprisings in spanish morocco in the midst of the crisis during and after the first spanish republic the  party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity such as catalonia or the basque districts by 1872 the  erupted this unrest led to the creation of a group in favor of the bourbon restoration made by some sectors of the conservatives led by canovas del castillo
the prince of asturias alfonso was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by canovas which led to the june 1870 abdication of queen isabel ii in favour of her son prince alfonso the new road map which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called alfonsismo and the moderate centrist cánovas del castillo became the spokesman as having alfonso in spain would be a problem  cánovas became responsible for his education so he sent alfonso to the sandhurst military academy in england where the training alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than spain given the current atmosphere
on 1 december 1874 alfonso issued the sandhurst manifesto where he set the ideological basis of the bourbon restoration  it was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the spanish monarchy at the end of 1874 brigadier  who had long been working more or less openly for the king led some battalions of the central army to  rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him and entered  in the kings name thereupon the president resigned and his power was transferred to the kings plenipotentiary and adviser  the 29 december 1874 military coup of gen martinez campos in sagunto ended the failed republic and  meant the rise of the young prince alfonso
within a few days after canovas del castillo took power as premier the new king proclaimed on 29 december 1874 arrived at madrid passing through  and  and was acclaimed everywhere 1875 in 1876 a vigorous campaign against the  in which the young king took part resulted in the defeat of  and the dukes abandonment of the struggle
initially led by canovas del castillo as moderate prime minister what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political administrative positions of power in reality ushered in a permanent civilian regime that lasted until the 1931 second republic  cánovas was the real architect of the new regime of the restoration
in order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of isabel ii the single party and its destabilizing consequences the liberal party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics and the turnismo or alternation was to become the new system turnismo would be endorsed in the constitution of 1876 and the pact of pardo palace 1885 it meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles
this led to the end of the carlist revolts and the victory over the new york backed cuban revolutionaries and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular spaniards of alfonso as a wise and able king
alfonsos short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of spain after the 1808–1874 crisis both european the coastal regions such as the basque country catalonia and asturias and overseas – antilles and pacific were able to grow steadily cuba and puerto rico prospered to the point that spains first train was between havana and camaguey and the worlds first telegraph was in puerto rico as samuel morse lived there with his daughter married to a puerto rican businessman upon the american invasion of puerto rico ten us dollars were needed to buy one puerto rican peso
on 23 january 1878 at the basilica of  in madrid alfonso married his first cousin princess  daughter of  but she died within six months of the marriage

a passionate fighting man he fought twenty nine battles against christian or moor he was married  when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor in 1109 to the ambitious queen  widow of  a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role  the marriage had been arranged by her father  in 1106 to unite the two chief christian states against the  and to supply them with a capable military leader  but urraca was tenacious of her right as  and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war even placing urraca under siege at astorga in 1112bernard f reilly the contest of christian and muslim spain 1031 1157 blackwell 1995 133 134  alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the  and the  but his only trustworthy supporters were his aragonese who were not numerous enough to keep  and  subjugated the marriage of alfonso and urraca was declared null by the pope as they were second cousins in 1110 but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with urraca until 1114 during his marriage he had called himself king and emperor of castile toledo aragón pamplona sobrarbe and ribagorza in recognition of his rights as urracas husband of his inheritance of the lands of his father including the kingdom of his great uncle  and his prerogative to conquer  from the muslims  he inserted the title of imperator on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule
alfonsos late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women ibn al athir 1166–1234 describes alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover who responded when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of muslim chiefs responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not womenquoted in lourie 1975639 note no bastards are recorded though they would have cut prominent figures under the circumstances no inference of homosexuality need be drawn the chastity that supports fitness for the hunt or for battle is a cultural  as old as the myth of

alfonso spent his first four years in near constant war with the muslims  in 1105 he conquered ejea and tauste and ortified castellar and juslibol  in 1106 he defeated  of zaragoza at valtierra  in 1107 he took tamarite de litera and esteban de la litera  then followed a period dominated by his relations with castile and león through his wife urraca  he resumed his conquest in 1117 by conquering      and 
in 1118 the council of toulouse declared a  to assist in the conquest of   many frenchmen consequently joined alfonso at   they took almudévar gurrea de gállego and zuera besieging zaragoza itself by the end of may the city fell on 18 december and the forces of alfonso occupied the azuda the government tower  the great palace of the city was given to the monks of bernard  promptly the city was made alfonsos capital  two years later in 1120 he defeated a muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the  he promulgated the fuero of tortum per tortum facilitating taking the law into ones own hands which among others reassumed the muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs
in 1119 he retook cervera tudejen castellón tarazona Ágreda magallón borja alagón novillas mallén rueda Épila and populated the region of   he began the siege of  but left to defeat the army at cutanda trying to retake zaragoza  when calatayud fell he took bubierca alhama de aragón ariza and daroca 1120  in 1123 he besieged and took  which was in the hands of the   from the winter of 1124 to september 1125 he was on a risky expedition to peña cadiella deep in andalusia
in the great raid of 1125 he carried away a large part of the subject christians from granada and in the south west of france he had claims as usurper king of navarre  from 1125 to 1126 he was on campaign against  where he was trying to install a christian prince and  where got only as far as motril  in 1127 he reconquered longares but simultaneously lost all his castilian possessions to   he confirmed a treaty with castile the next year 1128 with the  which fixed the boundaries of the two realms
he conquered molina de aragón and populated  in 1129 before besieging  which had fallen again upon the cids death
he went north of the pyrenees in october 1130 to protect the   early in 1131 he besieged   it is said he ruled from belorado to pallars and from bayonne to monreal
at the  in october 1131 three years before his death he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in palestine and politically largely independent   the  the  and the knights of the    whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out the will has greatly puzzled historians who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of alfonsos character one that effectively undid his lifes work elena lourie 1975 suggested instead that it was alfonsos attempt to neutralize the papacys interest in a disputed succession — aragon had been a fief of the papacy since 1068 — and to fend off urracas son from her first marriage alfonso vii of castile for the papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament indeed did write alfonso vii to just this effect 10 june 1135 or 36 lourie 1995645  generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on alfonso viis ambitions to break it — and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric in the event it was a will that his nobles used to carry out — instead bringing his brother ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers — an eventuality that lourie suggests was alfonsos hidden intent
his final campaigns were against mequinenza 1133 and fraga 1134 where  the future king of navarre and a mere 500 other knights fought with him  it fell on 17 july he was dead by september his tomb is in the  in 
the testament of alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms and possible successors were sought  alfonsos only brother  had been a  monk since childhood and his commitment to the church his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession the step son of the deceased king  as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of  put himself forward but garnered no local support  the nobility of navarre aligned behind  the grandson of alfonsos illegitimate uncle while the aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot bishop ramiro  a convention was called at  to develop a consensus but there peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him yet were unwilling to accept ramiro  the convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently
the choice of the navarrese lords fell on  lord of  descendant of an illegitimate son of  and protégé of alfonso vii to be their king the aragonese took ramiro out of a monastery and made him king marrying him without papal dispensation to agnes sister of the  then betrothing their newborn daughter to  who was then named ramiros heir the result of the crisis  produced by the result of alfonso is will was a major reorientation of the peninsulas kingdoms the separation of aragon and navarre the union of aragon and catalonia and — a moot point but stressed particularly by some castilian historians — the affirmation of castilian hegemony in spainlourie 1975636  by the rendering of homage for  by alfonsos eventual heir ramon berenguer iv of barcelona
sometime during the reign of  the battlers grandnephew a man came forward claiming to be alfonso the battler the only contemporary erences to this event are two letters of alfonso ii addressed to  they were carried to louis by  the  but are not datedthey were first published in the recueil des historiens des gaules et de la france correspondance de louis vii xv paris 1878 2nd ed nsupo sup 223–4 pp 71–2 and utitised extensively by marcelin defourneaux louis vii et le souverains espagnols lenigme du «pseudo alphonse» in estudios dedicados a menéndez pidal vi madrid 1956 647–61 they were published again by ubieto arteta 1958 appendices i and ii pp 37–8  according to the second of these the pretender was then living in louiss domains meaning the  which was ruled by alfonso under louiss suzerainty this pretender was an old man appropriately since the battler had died some decades earlier and alfonso ii expressed confidence that louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice the first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately since the bishop sojourned at the court of louis on his way to rome it is known from other sources that berengar attended the  in march 1179 the letters were probably written towards the end of 1178 or in january 1179 at the latestubieto arteta 1958 35 cites the evidence for aragons early support for alexander iii against the  the earliest possible date at which berengar could have been travelling to rome to meet alexander is after 23 november 1165 when the latter finally took up residence in rome  according to an annalist source for the years 1089–1196 the pretender was received with honour and pomp in zaragoza calatayud and daroca which the battler had conquered but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of barcelona in 1181antonio c floriano fragmentos de unos viejos anales 1089–1196 transcripción y análisis paleográfico crítica histórica boletín de la academia de la historia cxiv 1929 153–4 cited in ubieto arteta 1958 36blockquotevino un ferrero e dixo «yo so don alfonso el que presó a Çaragoça e cadatayut e daroqua» e recebido es en aquellos lugares con grant honra e con grant ponpa e dice muchas cosas que semeiavam verdat de lo passado quel havia fecho e era tenido por senyer e por don alfonso e despues fue conoscido que non era aquel e enforcáronlo muy desonradament devant la ciudad de barcelona blockquote  modern historian  has hypothesised that the aragonese lords of the tenencies of zaragoza calatayud and daroca — pedro de luesia loferrench de luna pedro de castillazuelo lord of calatayud pedro cornel lord of murillo de gállego and the majordomo jimeno de artusilla all of whom disappear between 1177 and 1181 in the documentation of their tenencies — supported at least inititally the pretenderubieto arteta 1958 note 24 who also connects the appearance of the pretender with the economic disasters that befell aragon in 1174  these lords also appear in the later legend of the  which has no historical basis as the victims of ramiro ii 1136 since historically they were not active in the 1130s it is possible that the historically based legend of the pseudo alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the bell of huesca

   do not add images of amaryllis the ornamental south american flower which is genus hippesstrum not amaryllis    
amaryllis brenzel kn ed 2001 sunset western garden book menlo park sunset publishing pp 606–607  is a small  of flowering s with two species the better known of the two amaryllis belladonna is a  of the  region of  particularly the rocky southwest area between the  valley to  name biodiveristyexp  for many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names amaryllis and hippeastrum one result of which is that the common name amaryllis is mainly used for s of the genus  widely sold in the winter months for their ability to  indoors plants of the genus amaryllis are known as belladonna lily jersey lily naked lady amarillo easter lily in southern  or in south africa march lily due to its propensity to flower around march this is one of numerous genera with the common name lily due to their flower shape and growth habit however they are only distantly related to the true lily 
amaryllis is a ous plant with each bulb being  in diameter it has several strap shaped green   long and  broad arranged in two rows
each bulb produces one or two leafless stems 30–60ampnbspcm tall each of which bears a cluster of two to twelve funnel shaped s at their tops each flower is  diameter with six s three outer sepals three inner petals with similar appearance to each other the usual color is white with crimson veins but pink or purple also occur naturally
the name amaryllis is taken from a shepherdess in s pastoral  from the    meaning to sparkle  and also from amarella for the bitterness of the bulb linné carl von 1737 hortus cliffortianus p 135 
the taxonomy of the genus has been controversial in 1753  created the name amaryllis belladonna the  of the genus amaryllis at the time both south african and south american plants were placed in the same genus subsequently they were separated into two different genera the key question is whether linnaeuss type was a south african plant or a south american plant if the latter amaryllis would be the correct name for the genus  and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here  et al have briefly summarized the debate which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the  the outcome was a decision by the 14th international botanical congress in 1987 that amaryllis smalll small should be a conserved name ie correct regardless of priority and ultimately based on a specimen of the south african  from the clifford herbarium at the british museum 
although the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus the common name amaryllis continues to be used differently bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as ready to bloom for the holidays belong to the allied genus eg   the common name naked lady used for amaryllis is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names such as the resurrection lily  the common name naked lady comes from the plants pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down
in areas of its native habitat with mountainous  flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth  in more open sandy areas of the western cape the plant flowers annually name biodiveristyexp   plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds large size and heavy weight  strong winds shake loose the seeds which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate aided by the first winter rains name biodiveristyexp  
the leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring the bulb is then dormant until late summer the plant is not frost tolerant nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production
one or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer march in its native habitat and august in 
the plant has a  relationship with   it is also visited by  at night   the relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established name biodiveristyexp   however carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the  the plants main parasite is the lily borer name plantz   and or 
amaryllis belladonna was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century it reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the west coast of the usa since these environments mimic their native south african habitat hardiness zones 6 8http  wwwcesncsuedu depts hort consumer factsheets bulbs summer amar_bellahtml north carolina state university  it is also naturalized in australia name apni 
there is an amaryllis belladonna hybrid which was bred in the 1800s in australia no one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white cream peach magenta and nearly red hues the hybrids were crossed back onto the original amaryllis belladonna and with each other to produce naturally seed bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes shapes stem heights and intensities of pink pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well the hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes veining darkened edges white centers and light yellow centers also setting them apart from the original light pink in addition the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the side facing habit of the old fashioned pink the hybrids are able to adapt to year round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be

his reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the aragonese nobles which eventually culminated in the articles of the    the so called magna carta of aragon which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles his inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne and brought the kingdom of aragon close to anarchy

amasis ii  or ahmose ii was a  reigned 570 bce – 526 bce of the  the successor of  at  he was the last great ruler of  before the  conquest name ocd 
most of our information about him is derived from  2161ff and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence according to the greek historian he was of common origins name dgrbm  he was originally an  in the egyptian army his birthplace was siuph at  already he took part in a general campaign of pharaoh  in 592 bc in 
a revolt which broke out among native egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne these troops returning home from a disastrous military expedition to  in libya suspected that they had been betrayed in order that  the reigning king might rule more absolutely by means of his greek  many egyptians fully sympathized with them general amasis sent to meet them and quell the revolt was proclaimed king by the rebels instead and apries who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries was defeated apries fled to the babylonians and was killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 bce with the aid of a babylonian army an inscription confirms the struggle between the native egyptian and the foreign soldiery and proves that apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of amasis c 567 bce amasis then married chedebnitjerbone ii one of the daughters of his predecessor  in order to legitimise his kingship  dodson places her as the wife of nakhthorheb  
some information is known about the family origins of amasis his mother was a certain tashereniset as a bust statue of this lady which is today located in the british museum showsaidan dodson amp dyan hilton the complete royal families of ancient egypt thames amp hudson 2004 pp245 amp 247  a stone block from mehallet el kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother—tasherenisets mother—was a certain tjenmutetjdodson amp hilton pp245 amp 247 
his court is relatively well known the head of the gate guard ahmose sa neith appears on numerous monuments including the location of his sarcophagus  he was called on monuments of the 30th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time  wahibre was leader of the southern foreigners and head of the doors of foreigners so he was the highest official for border security under amasis the career of doctors udjahorresnet began who was then under the persians of particular importance several heads of the fleet are known psamtek meryneit and pasherientaihet   padineith are the only occupied viziers
 describes how amasis ii would eventually cause a confrontation with the persian armies according to herodotus amasis was asked by  or  for an egyptian  on good terms amasis seems to have complied by forcing an egyptian physician into mandatory labor causing him to leave his family behind in egypt and move to persia in forced exile in an attempt to exact revenge for his forced exile the physician would grow very close to cambyses and would suggest that cambyses should ask amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the egyptians cambyses complied and requested a daughter of amasis for marriage name hero 
amasis worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the persian king used to give up his offspring amasis also was not willing to take on the persian empire so he concocted a trickery in which he forced the daughter of the ex pharaoh  whom herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by amasis to go to persia instead of his own offspring name hero  name sir  name herodotus 
this daughter of apries was none other than  who was as per herodotuss account tall and beautiful nitetis naturally betrayed amasis and upon being greeted by the persian king explained amasiss trickery and her true origins this infuriated cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it amasis would die before cambyses reached him but his heir and son psamtik iii would be defeated by the persians name hero  name herodotus 
first an alliance agreement was signed with the n king  and  the babylonian king in 542 bc the implementation of the agreements in real aid did not took place in 541 bc croesuss empire was conquered and in 539 bce the neo babylonian empire was conquered by the persians without egypts support towards its allies
herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor amasis ii relied on greek mercenaries and council men one such figure was  who would later on leave amasis for reasons herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures amasis would send one of his s to capture phanes but the eunuch is bested by the wise council man and phanes flees to persia meeting up with cambyses providing advice in his invasion of egypt egypt would finally be lost to persians during the  name herodotus 
although amasis thus appears first as champion of the disparaged native he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the  and brought egypt into closer touch with it than ever before herodotus relates that under his prudent administration egypt reached a new level of wealth amasis adorned the temples of  especially with splendid ic s and other monuments his activity here is proved by existing remains for example a temple built by him was excavated at

amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbor and flourished at an early date soon requiring several cemeteries greeks from  left their pottery at amathus from the 10th century bc during the post phoenician era of the 8th century bc a  was erected and a port was also constructed which served the trade with the  and the ines a special burial ground for infants a agelarakis a kanta a and n ch stampolidis “the osseous record in the western necropolis of amathous an archaeo anthropological investigation”  eastern mediterranean cyprus dodecanese crete 16th 6th c bc proceedings of the international symposium the eastern mediterranean cyprus dodecanese crete 16th 6th c bc rethymnon crete 1998 217 232 agelarakis a “the amathous tophet cremations in cyprus” in d christou on “human cremations at the western necropolis of amathous”  cremations in bronze and early iron age proceedings of int symposium  ministries of the aegean and of culture  greece 2001  201 204  served the culture of the ns for the hellenes high on the cliff a temple was built which became a worship site devoted to  in her particular local presence as  along with a bearded male aphrodite called macrobius saturnalia iii 8 hesychius sv Ἀφρόδιτος catullus 68 51 calling the amathusian aphrodite duplex confirms the attribution to amathus  the excavators discovered the final stage of the temple of aphrodite also known as  which dates approximately to the 1st century bc according to the legend it was where festive  took place in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions they also competed in dancing and singing all to the honour of adonis

andrea amati ca 1505 – ca 1578 designed and created the violin viola and cello known as the violin family he standardized the basic form shape size materials and method of construction makers from nearby brescia experimented such as gasparo da salò micheli zanetto and pellegrino but it was andrea amati in cremona italy who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile the first violin was ordered by  in 1555 his letter to amati stated the instrument was to be made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute but simple to play the first violin was intended to be used by illiterate musicians so the design was simple and it was easy to play what became of this first violin is not known  a number of his instruments survived for some time dating between 1538 amati made the first cello called the king in 1538 1 and 1574 the largest number these are from 1560 a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by  the regent queen of france and bore hand painted royal french decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son  of these 38 instruments ordered amati created violins of two sizes violas of two sizes and large sized cellos they were in use until the french revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived his work is marked by selection of the finest materials great elegance in execution soft clear amber soft translucent varnish and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design

andrea amati was succeeded by his sons antonio amati ca 1537–1607 and girolamo amati ca 1551–1630 the brothers amati as they were known implemented far reaching innovations in design including the perfection of the shape of the  they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of  in contrast to older tenor violas but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that  made violas ranging from altos of 39ampnbspcm to tenors of 447ampnbspcm
nicolò amati december 3 1596 – april 12 1684 was the son of girolamo amati he was the most eminent of the family he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of  his pattern was unusually small but he also made a wider model now known as the grand amati which have become his most sought after violins
of his pupils the most famous were  and  the first of the guarneri family of violin makers there is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of antonio stradivari while stradivaris first known violin states  that he was a pupil of amati the validity of his statement is questioned
the last maker of the family was nicolos son girolamo amati known as hieronymus ii february 26 1649 – february 21 1740 although he improved on the arching of his fathers instruments by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day antonio stradivari

 reported that the sarmatians were descendants of amazons and scythians and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands in war taking the field and wearing the very same dress as the men moreover said herodotus no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle in the story related by herodotus a group of amazons was blown across the  the  into  near the cliff region todays southeastern  after learning the scythian language they agreed to marry scythian men on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of scythian women according to herodotus this band moved toward the northeast settling beyond the   river and became the ancestors of the  according to herodotus the  fought with the scythians against  in the 5th century bce

speculation that the idea of amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials pointing to the possibility that some sarmatian women may have participated in battle these findings have led scholars to suggest that the amazonian legend in  may have been inspired by real warrior women 
evidence of high ranking warrior women comes from  in southern ukraine and russia
david anthony notes about 20% of   warrior graves on the lower  and lower  contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress a phenomenon that probably inspired the greek tales about the amazons name anthonyd 
up to 25% of military burials were of armed sarmatian women usually including bows name autogenerated1  russian archaeologist  points out that when scythian men were away fighting or hunting nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves their animals and pasture grounds competently during the time that the scythians advanced into asia and achieved near  in the near east there was a period of twenty eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods during this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves but to reproduce and this could well be the origin of the idea that amazons mated once a year with their neighbours if herodotus actually based his accounts on fact name autogenerated1

ambergris  or   ambre gris ambergrease or grey amber is a solid waxy flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of s  the word amber is derived from the arabic word anbarعنبرcupboard love 2 a dictionary of cullinary curiosities mark morton 
freshly produced ambergris has a marine  odour  however as it ages it acquires a sweet earthy scent commonly likened to the fragrance of  without the vaporous chemical astringency name burr  although ambergris was formerly highly valued by rs as a fixative allowing the scent to last much longer it has now largely been replaced by synthetic 
ambergris occurs as a  secretion of the  of the sperm whale and can be found floating upon the sea or lying on the coast it is also sometimes found in the s of s because the beaks of s have been found embedded within lumps of ambergris scientists have theorised that the substance is produced by the whales gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard sharp objects that the whale might have eaten the sperm whale usually vomits these but if one travels further down the gut it will be covered in ambergris name uchicago1  
ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter it is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit  it takes years for ambergris to form christopher kemp the author of floating gold a natural and unnatural history of ambergris says that it is only produced by sperm whales and only by an estimated one percent of them once expelled by a whale it must float for years then it must make landfall avoid being broken into pieces by rough seas and someone must find it  in other words the odds of finding ambergris are extremely small the very small chance of finding ambergris and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris

ambiorix was together with  prince of the  leader of a  tribe of north eastern   where modern  is located in the 19th century ambiorix became a   because of his  against  as written in caesars  name dgrbm 
in 57 bc julius caesar conquered parts of  and also  belgium modern day northern france luxembourg part of present day netherlands below the  river and the north western portion of north rhine westphalia germany there were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently the  were ruled by ambiorix and  in 54 bc caesars troops urgently needed more food and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their  which had not been good that year understandably the  eburones were reluctant to do so and caesar ordered that  be built near the eburones villages each  was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the   this created resentment among the eburones
although  had freed him from paying tribute to the  ambiorix joined  in the winter of 54 bc in an uprising against the  forces under  and 
because a drought had disrupted his grain supply caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious belgic tribes roman troops led by q titurius sabinus and l aurunculeius cotta were wintering among the eburones when they were attacked by them led by ambiorix and cativolcus ambiorix deceived the romans telling them the attack was made without his consent and further advised them to flee as a large germanic force was preparing to cross the rhine trusting ambiorix sabinus and cottas troops left the next morning a short distance from their camp the roman troops were ambushed by the eburones and massacred
elsewhere another roman force under  brother of the orator  were wintering amongst the nervii leading a coalition of rebellious belgic tribes ambiorix surrounded ciceros camp after a long while a roman messenger was finally able to slip through the belgic lines and get word of the uprising to caesar mobilizing his legions caesar immediately marched to ciceros aid as they approached the besieged roman camp the belgae moved to engage caesars troops vastly outnumbered caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened and they successfully lured the belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the romans caesars forces launched a fierce counterattack and soon put the belgae to flight later caesars troops entered ciceros camp to find most of the men wounded
meanwhile indutiomarus a leader of the treveri began to harass the camp of labienus on a daily basis eventually provoking labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill indutiomarus they did so and routed the remnants of the late indutiomaruss army caesar personally remained in gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed gallic threat
when the  heard what had happened caesar swore to put down all the belgic tribes ambiorix had killed a whole roman  and five  a belgic attack on q tullius cicero then stationed with a legion in the territory of the  failed due to the timely appearance of caesar the roman campaigns against the belgae took a few years but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned the eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event according to the writer  ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the  and disappeared without a trace iii 10 § 8 
caesar wrote about ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the gauls  in this text he also wrote the famous line of these three regions the belgae are the bravest ampnbsphorum omnium fortissimi sunt belgaeampnbsp
ambiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the 19th century when belgium became independent in 1830 the national government started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as  in caesars de bello gallico they discovered ambiorix and his deeds in 1841 the belgian poet  wrote a al  about ambiorix and on september 5 1866 a statue of ambiorix was erected on the main market square in  belgium erred to by caesar as  ie atuatuca tungrorum
today ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in  history many companies bars and s have named themselves after him and in many belgian  such as  and  he plays a guest role there was also a short lived comic called ambionix  which featured a scientist teleporting a belgic chief loosely based on ambiorix to modern day belgium
in the french comic  in the album     and  go to belgium because they are angry with caesar about his remark that the belgians are the bravest of all the gauls

during what many s call the formative period amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of south americas highland  systems and possibly contributed directly to the social and religious fabric constitutive of the  civilizational orders
early human settlements were typically based on low lying hills or mounds

five types of archaeological mound have been noted in the amazon region shell use and artificial mounds artificial earth platforms for entire villages earth mounds and ridges for cultivation causeways and canals and figurative mounds both geometric and biomorphic

shell mounds were the earliest they represent piles of human use and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 bp they all represent pottery age cultures no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists
artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds they are best represented by the 
figurative mounds are the latest chronologically

orellana took about 57 men the boat and some canoes and left pizarros party on 26 december 1541 however orellana apparently missed the confluence probably with the  where he was to look for food by the time he and his men reached another village many of them were sick from hunger and eating noxious plants and near death seven men died at that village his men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join pizarros larger party he accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of spain and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream after a journey of 600ampnbspkm down the napo river they reached a further major confluence at a point near modern  and then followed the upper amazon now known as the solimões for a further 1200ampnbspkm to its confluence with the rio negro near modern  which they reached on 3 june 1542 on the  a tributary of the amazon downstream from manaus orellanas party had a fierce battle with warriors who they reported were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat orellanas men began erring to the women as  a erence to the women of  the river was initially known as the  the name by which the peruvian part of the river is still known today or rio de orellana it later became known as the rio amazonas the name by which it is still known in both spanish and portuguese

the  revolt 1835–1840 was directed against the white ruling class it is estimated that from 30 to 40% of the population of  estimated at 100000 people died 
the total population of the brazilian portion of the amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300000 of whom about two thirds were europeans and slaves the slaves amounting to about 25000 the brazilian amazons principal commercial city pará now belém had from 10000 to 12000 inhabitants including slaves the town of manáos now manaus at the mouth of the rio negro had a population between 1000 to 1500 all the remaining villages as far up as  on the brazilian frontier of peru were relatively small
on 6 september 1850 emperor  sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the amazon and gave the viscount of mauá  the task of putting it into effect he organized the companhia de navegação e comércio do amazonas in rio de janeiro in 1852 in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers the monarca monarch the cametá the marajó and the rio negro 
at first navigation was principally confined to the main river and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between pará and manaus with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity a second line to make six round voyages a year between manaus and tabatinga and a third two trips a month between pará and cametá this was the first step in opening up the vast interior
the success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the amazon and a second company soon opened commerce on the madeira purús and negro a third established a line between pará and manaus and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams in that same period the amazonas company was increasing its fleet meanwhile private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries
on 31 july 1867 the government of brazil constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the  basin especially peru decreed the opening of the amazon to all countries but they limited this to certain defined points tabatinga – on the amazon cametá – on the tocantins santarém – on the tapajós borba – on the madeira and manaus – on the rio negro the brazilian decree took effect on 7 september 1867
thanks in part to the  development associated with  navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for  the peruvian city of  became a thriving cosmopolitan center of commerce foreign companies settled in iquitos from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber in 1851 iquitos had a population of 200 and by 1900 its population reached 20000 in the 1860s approximately 3000 tons of rubber was being exported annually and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44000 tons representing 93% of perus exportshistoria del peru editorial lexus p 93  during the  it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants such as  and  killed 40000 native amazoniansla republica oligarquica  editorial lexus 2000 p 925 
the first direct foreign trade with manaus commenced around 1874 local trade along the river was carried on by the english successors to the amazonas company—the amazon steam navigation company—as well as numerous small steamboats belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade navigating the negro madeira purús and many other tributaries such as the marañón to ports as distant as  peru
by the turn of the 20th century the exports of the amazon basin were  s s and a few other products of minor importance such as  and exotic forest produce s barks woven s prized bird s live animals and extracted goods such as  and gold
for 350 years after the first european encounter of the amazon by pinzón the portuguese portion of the basin remained an untended former food gathering and planned agricultural landscape occupied by the  who survived the arrival of european diseases
four centuries after the european discovery of the amazon river the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than  excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters this situation changed dramatically during the 20th century
wary of foreign exploitation of the nations resources brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land the original architect of this expansion was president  with the demand for rubber from the allied forces in world war ii providing funding for the drive
in 1960 the construction of the new capital city of  in the interior also contributed to the opening up of the amazon basin a large scale colonization program saw families from northeastern brazil relocated to the forests encouraged by promises of cheap land many settlements grew along the road from brasília to belém but rainforest soil proved difficult to cultivate
still long term development plans continued roads were cut through the forests and in 1970 the work on the  transamazônica network began the networks three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise large portions of the trans amazonian and its accessory roads such as  manaus  are derelict and impassable in the rainy season small towns and villages are scattered across the forest and because its vegetation is so dense some remote areas are still unexplored
with a population of 19 million people in 2014 manaus is the largest city on the amazon manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest brazilian state of  the racial makeup of the city is 64%  mulatto and mestizo and 32%  
  see talk page re most distant source 15 november 2015  the most distant source of the amazon was thought to be in the apurímac river drainage for nearly a century such studies continued to be published even recently such as in 1996 name palkiewicz  2001  2007 name bbc amazon  and 2008 name inpe  where various authors identified the snowcapped   peak as the most distant source of the river from this point located roughly  west of  and  southeast of  quebrada  emerges from nevado mismi joins quebrada apacheta and soon forms río lloqueta which becomes río hornillos and eventually joins the  after about 700ampnbspkm the apurímac then joins río mantaro  to form the ene which joins the perene to form the tambo which joins the urubamba to form the ucayali which later joins río marañón to form what most people subsequently call the amazon river
a 2014 study by americans james contos and nicolas tripcevich in  a peer reviewed journal of the  however identifies the most distant source of the amazon as actually being in the  drainage name contostripcevich    a variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the mantaro river vs the apurimac river from their most distant source points to their confluence showing the longer length of the mantaro  then distances from lago junín to several potential source points in the uppermost mantaro river were measured which enabled them to determine that the cordillera rumi cruz was the most distant source of water in the mantaro basin and theore in the entire amazon basin  the most accurate measurement method was direct gps measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence performed by contos obtaining these measurements was difficult given the  nature of each of these rivers especially in their lower abyss sections  ultimately they determined that the most distant point in the mantaro drainage is nearly 80ampnbspkm farther upstream compared to mt mismi in the apurímac drainage and thus the maximal length of the amazon river is about 80ampnbspkm longer than previously thought contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the amazon river from its newly identified source finishing november 2012 a journey repeated by two groups after the news spreadbloggeographydirectionscom 2014 04 03 redefining the upper amazon river  
while the ucayali–marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the amazon proper in brazil the river is known at this point as the  das Águas further downriver from that confluence the darkly colored waters of the rio negro meet the sandy colored  and for over  these waters run side by side without mixing
after the confluence of apurímac and ucayali the river leaves andean terrain and is surrounded by  from this point to the marañón some  the forested banks are just out of water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage the low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills and the river enters the enormous 
the river systems and flood plains in brazil peru ecuador colombia and venezuela whose waters drain into the solimões and its tributaries are called the upper amazon
the amazon river proper runs mostly through brazil and peru it is part of the border between colombia and perú and it has tributaries reaching into venezuela colombia ecuador and bolivia
 has a series of major river systems in   and  some of which flow into the  and ucayali others directly into the amazon proper among others these include the following rivers       nucuray urituyacu     and 
at some points the river divides into es or multiple channels often very long with inland and lateral  all connected by a complicated system of natural canals cutting the low flat igapó lands which are never more than  above low river into many islands
from the town of canaria at the great bend of the amazon to the negro vast areas of land are submerged at high water above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear near the mouth of the rio negro to serpa nearly opposite the river madeira the banks of the amazon are low until approaching manaus they rise to become rolling hills at Óbidos a bluff  above the river is backed by low hills the lower amazon seems to have once been a  of the atlantic ocean the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos
only about ten percent of the amazons water enters downstream of Óbidos very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley the drainage area of the amazon basin above Óbidos city is about  and below only about  around 20% exclusive of the  of the tocantins basin the  enters the southern portion of the amazon delta
in the lower reaches of the river the north bank consists of a series of steep table topped hills extending for about  from opposite the mouth of the xingu as far as  these hills are cut down to a kind of  which lies between them and the river
on the south bank above the xingu a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to  in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest and abutting upon the lower tapajós merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the tapajós river valley
 is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the atlantic ocean  the definition of where exactly the mouth of the amazon is located and how wide it is is a matter of dispute because of the areas peculiar geography the pará and the amazon are connected by a series of river channels called furos near the town of  between them lies  the worlds largest combined river sea island
if the pará river and the marajó island ocean frontage are included the amazon  is some  wide name guo   in this case the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from cabo norte the cape located straight east of  in the brazilian state of  to ponta da tijoca near the town of  in the state of 
a more conservative measurement excluding the pará river estuary from the mouth of the  to ponta do navio on the northern coast of marajó would still give the mouth of the amazon a width of over  if only the rivers main channel is considered between the islands of curuá state of amapá and jurupari state of pará the width falls to about 
while debate as to whether the amazon or the  is the worlds longest river has gone on for many years the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the amazon as the second longest river in the world with the nile being the longest however the amazon has been measured by different geographers as being anywhere between  long it is often said to be at least  long name britannica amazon  the nile is reported to be anywhere from  often it is said to be about  long name britannica nile  there are many factors that can affect these measurements
a study by brazilian scientists concluded that the amazon is actually longer than the nile using  which in 2001 was labeled by the  as the amazons source these scientists made new calculations of the amazons length they calculated the amazons length as  using the same techniques they calculated the length of the nile as  which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the amazon they made it possible by measuring the amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of canal do sul and then after a sharp turn back following tidal canals surrounding the isle of marajó and finally including the marine waters of the río pará bay in its entire length name inpe     director of science at the  ibge told the brazilian tv network  in june 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the amazon was the longest river in the world however other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001 and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these brazilian scientists the length of both the amazon and the nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate name britannica amazon

the amazon river originated as a transcontinental river in the miocene epoch between 118 million and 113 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 24 million years ago
the amazon once flowed west as part of a proto amazon congo river system from the interior of present day africa when the continents were joined as western  fifteen million years ago the andes were formed by the collision of the south american plate with the nazca plate the rise of the andes and the linkage of the brazilian and guyana bedrock shields blocked the river and caused the amazon to become a vast inland sea gradually this inland sea became a massive swampy freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater for example over 20 species of stingray most closely related to those found in the pacific ocean can be found today in the freshwaters of the amazon
ten to eleven million years ago waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the amazon began to flow eastward leading to the emergence of the amazon rainforest during ice ages sea levels dropped and the great amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river which would eventually become the worlds largest draining the most extensive expanse of rainforest on the planet 
scientists have discovered the longest underground river actually a   in the world in brazil water in the aquifer flows a distance of  at a depth of nearly  it flows from the andean foothills to the atlantic coast in a nearly west to east direction like the amazon river the discovery was made public in august 2011 name tvibtimescom  meeting of the brazilian geophysical society in  the river named  after the discoverer an indian born scientist  who is working with the national observatory at rio makes it the first and geologically unusual instance of a twin river system flowing at different levels of the earths crust in brazil a combination of  data and anomalous temperature variation with depth measured in 241 inactive oil wells helped locate the aquifer except for the flow direction the amazon and the hamza have very different characteristics the most obvious ones are their width and flow speed while the amazon is  to  wide the hamza is  to  in width but the flow speed is   in the amazon and less than  speed in the hamza name tvibtimescom  
several geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies the large deep aquifer formed when the plate carrying the pacific ocean bottom was dragged and ends up under the continental plate water at such depths would normally escape upwards but the unusual conditions that exist along the eastern pacific rim allow the moisture to remain intact in the case of the hamza the  and  s behave as conduits for the water to sink to greater depths east west trending  and the  present along the northern border of the amazon basin may have some role in supplying water to the river if the impermeable rocks stop the vertical flow the west to east gradient of the topography directs it to flow towards the atlantic ocean
unlike the hamza the 153ampnbspkm long underground river in mexicos  and the 82ampnbspkm long  in the in the  have come into being thanks to the  water in these places has dissolved the carbonate rock to form  extensive underground river systems

alredus or alfred of beverley  1143  was  of the church of  in the first half of the twelfth century
he wrote apparently about the year 1143 a  entitled annales sive historia de gestis regum britanniae which begins with  and carries the history of england down to 1129  and  are alfreds chief sources
alfred of beverley was a priest of beverley and is described in the pace to his book as treasurer of the church of beverley and master alfred sacrist of the church of beverley
alfred of beverley speaks of himself as contemporary with the removal of the flemings from the north of england to ross in heordshire in 1112 and writes that he compiled his chronicle when the church was silent owing to the number of persons excommunicated under the decree of the council of london an apparent erence to the council held at mid lent 1143 his attention by his own account was first drawn to history by the publication before 1139 of   and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name and which largely depends on geoffreys work with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the  but no trace of such a work is extant
alfred of beverleys chronicle is entitled aluredi beverlacensis annales sive historia de gestis regum britanniæ libris ix ad annum 1129 it is largely devoted to the fabulous history of britain and is mainly borrowed from   and  when geoffrey of monmouth is not laid under contribution alfred quotes occasionally from   and  and names many roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for erences to britain the chronicle is of no real use to the historical student since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well known earlier authorities
according to sidney lee 1885 the best manuscript of alfreds annales was among the hengwrt mss belonging to w w e wynne esq of peniarth merionethshire and had not been printed hearne printed the ‘annales’ in 1716 from an inferior bodleian ms rawl b 200
