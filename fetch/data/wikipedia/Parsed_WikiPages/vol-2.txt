ajax or aias  or   was a  the son of king  and  and the half brother of http  wwwsalaminagr english indexhtm salamis the island salamis the island    salamina municipality   greek island  he plays an important role in s  and in the  a series of  about the  to distinguish him from ajax son of oileus  he is called telamonian ajax greater ajax or ajax the great  in  he is known as aivas tlamunus
ajax is the son of telamon who was the son of  and grandson of  and his first wife periboea he is the cousin of  and is the elder  of  many illustrious  including    and the historian  traced their descent from ajax the italian scholar maggiani recently showed that on an etruscan tomb dedicated to racvi satlnei in bologna 5th century bc there is a writing that says aivastelmunsl   family of ajax télamon
in homers iliad he is described as of great stature colossal frame and strongest of all the  known as the bulwark of the achaeanshomer iliad http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textdoc hom+il+65 65  he was trained by the   who had trained ajax father telamon and achilles father  and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by  whom he was at the time training at the same time as achilles he was described as fearless strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow hides with a layer of bronze most notably ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the iliad and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles although in book 13 poseidon strikes ajax with his staff renewing his strength
in the iliad ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage seen particularly in two fights with  in book 7 ajax is chosen by lot to meet hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day ajax at first gets the better of the encounter wounding hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone 7268272  but hector fights on until the s acting at the direction of zeus call a draw the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts ajax giving hector a purple sash and hector giving ajax his sharp sword
the second fight between ajax and hector occurs when the latter breaks into the mycenaean camp and fights with the greeks among the ships in book 14 ajax throws a giant rock at hector which almost kills him 14408417  in book 15 hector is restored to his strength by  and returns to attack the ships ajax wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship holds off the  armies virtually single handedly in book 16 hector and ajax duel once again  hector is set on burning the ships the only way he feels the greeks will truly be defeated hector is able to disarm ajax although ajax is not hurt and ajax is forced to retreat seeing that zeus is clearly favoring hector hector and the trojans succeed in burning one greek ship the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war ajax is responsible for the death of many trojans lords including 
ajax often fought in tandem with his brother teucer known for his skill with the bow  ajax would wield his magnificent shield as teucer stood behind picking off enemy trojans
achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with agamemnon in book 9 agamemnon and the other mycenaean chiefs send ajax  and  to the tent of achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight although ajax speaks earnestly and is well received he does not succeed in convincing achilles
when  is killed hector tries to steal his body ajax assisted by  succeeds in fighting off the trojans and taking the body back with his chariot however the trojans had already stripped patroclus of achilles armor ajaxs prayer to zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial  according to  in total ajax killed 28 people at troyhyginus  http  wwwtheoicom text hyginusfabulae3html 114 
 
like most of the other greek leaders ajax is alive and well as the iliad comes to a close when achilles dies killed by  with help from apollo ajax and odysseus are the heroes who fight against the trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion patroclushomer odyssey http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textdoc hom+od+242  ajax with his great shield and spear manages to drive off the trojans while odysseus pulls the body to his chariot and rides away with it to safety after the burial each claims achilles magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts after several days of competition odysseus and ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor which had been forged on  by the smith god  it is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the greeks including saving the ships from hector and driving him off with a massive rock he deserves the armorovid metamorphoses translated by rolfe humphries indianapolis indiana university 1955 book xiii pp 305 309   however odysseus proves to be more eloquent and the council gives him the armor ajax unconquered and furious falls upon his own sword conquered by his own sorrowmetamorphoses trans humphries pampnbsp318   
the  a marble torso now in the vatican museums is considered to depict ajax in the act of contemplating his suicide 
in sophocles play  a famous retelling of ajaxs demise after the armor is awarded to odysseus ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill agamemnon and menelaus athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them imagining they are the achaean leaders including odysseus and agamemnon when he comes to his senses covered in blood he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor and decides that he pers to kill himself rather than live in shame he does so with the same sword which hector gave him when they exchanged presents 7303  from his blood sprang a red flower as at the death of  which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name ai also expressive of lament 1354  his ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the  promontory at the entrance of the 
ajaxs half brother teucer stood trial before his father for not bringing ajaxs body or weapons back teucer was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence he was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home the island of salamis off the coast of athens
homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of ajaxs death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over achilles armor when odysseus visits  he begs the soul of ajax to speak to him but ajax still resentful over the old quarrel uses and descends silently back into 
like achilles he is represented although not by homer as living after his death on the  at the mouth of the  http  wwwtheoicom text pausanias3bhtml description of greece iii 19 § 13  ajax who in the post homeric legend is described as the grandson of aeacus and the great grandson of zeus was the  of the island of salamis where he had a temple and an image and where a festival called aianteia was celebrated in his honourpausanias 135  at this festival a couch was set up on which the  of the hero was placed a practice which recalls the roman  the identification of ajax with the family of aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the athenians after salamis had come into their possession on which occasion  is said to have inserted a line in the  2557–558  http  wwwperseustuftsedu hopper textjsessionid 0ae5cea2e5e28fe965ff802c44870114doc hom+il+2557 2557258  for the purpose of supporting the athenian claim to the island ajax then became an  hero he was worshiped at athens where he had a statue in the market place and the tribe aiantis was named after him pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton its kneecap  in diameter appeared on the beach near  on the trojan coast these bones were identified as those of ajax
there is  that ajax founded the city of  in the mediterranean island of  now part of france and gave it his name
in 2001 yannos lolos began excavating a  palace on the island of salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological aiacid dynasty  the ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of kanakia of salamis a few miles off the coast of athens the multi story structure covers  and had perhaps 30 rooms the trojan war is supposed by many  to have occurred at the height of the mycenaean civilization see discussion of  roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned

alaric i    supreme chief b 370 or 375 – d 410 was the first  of the  from 395–410 son or paternal grandson of chieftain   alaric is best known for his  in 410 which marked a decisive event in the 
alaric began his career under the gothic soldier  and later joined the roman army  alarics first appearance was as the leader of a mixed band of  and allied peoples who invaded  in 391 and were stopped by the half  roman general  in 394 he led a gothic force of 20000 that helped the   defeat the  usurper  at the  despite sacrificing around 10000 of his men alaric received little recognition from the emperor disappointed he left the army and was elected  of the  in 395 and marched toward  until he was diverted by roman forces he then moved southward into  where he sacked  the port of  and destroyed    and  as a response the eastern emperor  appointed alaric  master of the soldiers in 
in 401 alaric invaded italy but he was defeated by  at  modern pollenza on april6 402 a second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the  though alaric forced the  to pay a large subsidy to the visigoths during  italian invasion in 406 alaric remained idle in  in 408   ordered the execution of stilicho and his family amid rumours that the general had made a deal with alaric honorius then incited the roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of  goths serving in the roman military subsequently around 30000 gothic soldiers defected to alaric and joined his march on rome to avenge their murdered families name heather 
moving swiftly along s alaric sacked the cities of  and  and ravaged the lands along the  the visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to rome in 408 eventually the senate granted him a substantial subsidy in addition alaric forced the senate to liberate all 40000  slaves in rome honorius however used to appoint alaric as the commander of the western roman army and in 409 the visigoths again surrounded rome alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming  as  attalus appointed him  master of both services but used to allow him to send an army into  negotiations with honorius broke down and alaric deposed attalus in the summer of 410 and besieged rome for the third time allies within the capital opened the gates for him on august24 and for three days his troops  although the visigoths plundered rome they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings having abandoned a plan to occupy  and  after the destruction of his fleet in a storm alaric died as the visigoths were marching northward
born on  at the mouth of the  in present day  alaric belonged to the noble  of the   the goths suffered setbacks against the  made a mass migration across the  and fought a  alaric was probably a child during this period
during the fourth century the  commonly employed   under roman command but organized by tribal structures to spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money emperors began to employ units recruited from germanic tribes  the largest of these contingents was that of the goths who in 382 376 in some sources had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries keeping a large degree of autonomy
in 394 alaric served as a leader of foederati under  in the campaign which crushed the usurper  as the  which terminated this campaign was fought at the passes of the  alaric probably learned the weakness of  natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the 
theodosius died in 395 leaving the empire to be divided between his two sons  and  the former taking  and the latter  of the empire arcadius showed little interest in ruling leaving most of the actual power to his   honorius was still a minor as his guardian theodosius had appointed the   stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of arcadius causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts
according to  in  during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies he was denied the promotion however among the visigoths settled in lower  now part of bulgaria and romania the situation was ripe for rebellion they had suffered disproportionately great losses at frigidus according to rumour exposing the visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the gothic tribes this combined with their post battle rewards prompted them to raise alaric on a shield and proclaim him king according to  a 6th century roman bureaucrat of gothic origin who later turned his hand to history both the new king and his people decided rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others
alaric struck first at the eastern empire he marched to the neighborhood of  but finding himself unable to undertake a siege retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through  and the unguarded pass of  into 
the armies of the eastern empire were occupied with  incursions in  and  instead rufinus attempted to negotiate with alaric in person which only aroused suspicions in constantinople that rufinius was in league with the goths stilicho now marched east against alaric according to  stilicho was in a position to destroy the goths when he was ordered by arcadius to leave  soon after rufinus own soldiers hacked him to death power in constantinople now passed to the eunuch chamberlain 
rufinus death and stilichos departure gave free rein to alarics movements he ravaged  but spared  which capitulated at once to the conqueror in 396 he wiped out the last remnants of the  in attica ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the  then he penetrated into the  and captured its most famous cities—  and —selling many of their inhabitants into slavery
here however his victorious career suffered a serious setback in 397 stilicho crossed the sea to greece and succeeded in trapping the goths in the mountains of  on the borders of  and  in the peninsula from there alaric escaped with difficulty and not without some suspicion of connivance by stilicho who supposedly had again received orders to depart alaric then crossed the  and marched with the plunder of  northward to  here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him magister militum per illyricum giving him the roman command he had desired as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals
it was probably in 401 that alaric made his first invasion of italy originally with the intention to petition for a position closer to rome alaric had a fascination for the golden age of rome and insisted on his tribesmen calling him alaricus   supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise some lines of the roman poet  inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a  break off all delays alaric this very year thou shalt force the alpine barrier of italy thou shalt penetrate to the city but the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time after spreading desolation through north  and striking terror into the citizens of rome alaric was met by  at  today in  the battle which followed on april 6 402 coinciding with easter was a victory for rome though a costly one but it effectively halted the goths progress
stilichos enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great christian festival alaric too was outwardly a christian though an  not  though he continued to practice the pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing christian ritual practices he had trusted to the sanctity of easter for immunity from attack
alarics wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children which gave his invasion of italy the character of a 
after another defeat before  alaric left italy probably in 403 he had not penetrated to the city but his invasion of italy had produced important results it caused the imperial residence to be transferred from  to  and necessitated the withdrawal of  from britain
alaric became the friend and ally of his erstwhile opponent  by 407 the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war stilicho actually proposed using alarics troops to enforce honorius claim to the  of illyricum the death of arcadius in may 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court but alaric who had actually entered epirus demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the expenses of  the sum which he named was a large one 4000ampnbsppounds of gold under strong pressure from stilicho the roman senate consented to promise its payment
but three months later stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on honorius orders in the unrest that followed throughout italy the wives and children of the foederati were slain name heather  consequently these 30000 men flocked to alarics camp clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies he accordingly led them across the julian alps and in september 408 stood before the walls of  now with no capable general like stilicho as a defender and began a strict blockade
no blood was shed this time alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon when the ambassadors of the  entreating for peace tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish he laughed and gave his celebrated answer the thicker the hay the easier mowed after much bargaining the famine stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5000 pounds of gold 30000 pounds of silver 4000 silken tunics 3000 hides dyed scarlet and 3000 pounds of pepper name norj norwich byzantium the early centuries 134  along came 40000 freed  slaves thus ended alarics first siege of rome
throughout his career alarics primary goal was not to undermine the empire but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the empires borders his demands were certainly grand the concession of a block of territory 200ampnbspmiles long by 150 wide between the  and the gulf of  to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the empire and the title of commander in chief of the imperial army immense as his terms were the emperor would have been well advised to grant them honorius however used to see beyond his own safety guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of  as all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed alaric after instituting a second siege and blockade of  in 409 came to terms with the senate with their consent he set up a rival emperor the pect of the city a greek named 
alaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with honorius these negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another goth  an  and theore hereditary enemy of alaric and his house alaric again outwitted by an enemys machinations marched southward and in deadly earnest began his third siege of rome apparently defence was impossible there are hints not well substantiated of treachery surprise is a more likely explanation however this may be—for our information at this point of the story is meagre—on august 24 410 alaric and his visigoths burst in by the  on the northeast of the city rome for so long victorious against its enemies was now at the mercy of its foreign conquerors
the contemporary  recorded with wonder many instances of the visigoths clemency christian churches saved from ravage protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and christians who took uge therein vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling spared because they belonged to st peter at least one case in which a beautiful roman matron appealed not in vain to the better feelings of the gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor but even these exceptional instances show that rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city nonetheless the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire save the  which were situated close to the gate by which the goths had made their entrance nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to alaric and his followers the  in the  did burn down which perhaps can be attributed to alaric the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor the pagan emperors tombs of the  and  were rifled and the ashes scattered
alaric having penetrated the city marched southwards into  he desired to invade africa which thanks to its grain had become the key to holding italy but a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned alaric died soon after in  probably of fevererik durschmied from armageddon to the fall of rome p 401 ch 17 2002 london coronet  and his body was according to legend buried under the riverbed of the  in accordance with the pagan practices of the visigothic people the stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug wherein the gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred when the work was finished the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret
alaric was succeeded in the command of the gothic army by his brother in law  who married honorius sister  three years later
the chief authorities on the career of alaric are the historian  and the poet  both contemporary neither disinterested  a historian who lived probably about half a century after alarics death and  a goth who wrote the history of his nation in 551 basing his work on  the legend of alarics burial in the buzita river comes from jordanes

albertus magnus  before 1200 – november 15 1280 also known as albert the great and albert of cologne is a catholic saint he was a german dominican  and a  he was known during his lifetime as doctor universalis and doctor expertus and late in his life the term magnus was appended to his name  scholars such as james a weisheipl and joachim r söder have erred to him as the greatest german philosopher and theologian of the joachim r söder albert der grosse – ein staunen  erregendes wunder wort und antwort 41 2000 145 ja weisheipl albertus magnus joseph strayer ed dictionary of the middle ages 1 new york scribner 1982 129  the  honours him as a  one of only 36 so honoured
it seems likely that albert was born sometime before 1200 given well attested evidence that he was aged over 80 on his death in 1280 more than one source says that albert was 87 on his death which has led 1193 to be commonly given as the date of alberts birth name 0   albert was probably born in  now in  since he called himself albert of lauingen but this might simply be a family name most probably his family was of ministerial class his familiar connection with being son of the count bollstädt noble family was a 15th century misinterpretation what is now completely disproved name 0tugwell simon albert and thomas new york paulist press 1988 p 3 96–7 
albert was probably educated principally at the  where he received instruction in s writings a late account by rudolph de novamagia ers to albertus encounter with the  who convinced him to enter  in 1223 or 1229 he became a member of the  and studied  at  and elsewhere selected to fill the position of lecturer at cologne germany where the dominicans had a house he taught for several years there and at    and  during his first tenure as lecturer at cologne albert wrote his summa de bono after discussion with  concerning the transcendental properties of being name kovach francs 1980 pxkovach francs and rober shahan albert the great commemorative essays  norman oklahoma university of oklahoma press 1980 px  in 1245 albert became master of theology under gueric of saint quentin the first german dominican to achieve this distinction following this turn of events albert was able to teach theology at the  as a full time professor holding the seat of the chair of theology at the college of st james name kovach francs 1980 px hampden the life p 33  during this time  began to study under albertus name kennedyhttp  wwwnewadventorg cathen 01264ahtm kennedy daniel st albertus magnus the catholic encyclopedia vol 1 new york robert appleton company 1907 10 sept 2014 
albert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of  thus making them accessible to wider academic debate the study of  brought him to study and comment on the teachings of muslim academics notably  and  and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate
in 1254 albert was made  of the dominican order name kennedy  and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency during his tenure he publicly defended the dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the university of paris commented on  and answered what he perceived as errors of the  averroes

after suffering a collapse of health in 1278 he died on november 15 1280 in the dominican convent in cologne  since november 15 1954 his relics are in a roman sarcophagus in the  of the dominican st  church in cologne  although his body was discovered to be incorrupt at the first exhumation three years after his death at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained name cruz 1977 
albert was  in 1622 he was  and proclaimed a doctor of the church on december 16 1931 by  name markus  and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941 st alberts  is november 15
alberts writings collected in 1899 went to thirty eight volumes these displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as  theology             and  he digested interpreted and systematized the whole of aristotles works gleaned from the latin translations and notes of the arabian commentators in accordance with church doctrine most modern knowledge of aristotle was preserved and presented by albert name kennedy 
his principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the books of the sentences of  magister sententiarum and the summa theologiae in two volumes the latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former
alberts activity however was more philosophical than theological see  the philosophical works occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes are generally divided according to the  scheme of the sciences and consist of interpretations and condensations of aristotles relative works with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master albert believed that aristotles approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a christian philosophical view of the natural order name markus 
alberts knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate his industry in every department was great and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy his protracted study of aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition an exception to this general tendency is his latin treatise de falconibus later inserted in the larger work de animalibus as book 23 chapter 40 in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a the differences between the  and the other kinds of birds b the different kinds of s c the way of preparing them for the  and d the cures for sick and wounded falconsan smets le réception en langue vulgaire du de falconibus dalbert le grand in medieval forms of argument disputation and debate ed georgiana donavin carol poster and richard utz eugene or wipf amp stock 2002 pp 189–99  his scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries bestowing upon him the honourable surname doctor universalis
in de mineralibus albert claims the aim of natural philosophy science is not to simply to accept the statements of others but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature aristotelianism greatly influences alberts view on nature and philosophy name kennedy  another example of his reason to formally search for the causes is in his treatises on plants he begins with the principle experiment is the only safe guide in such investigations his studies of aristotle and theology show their colors in nearly all of his works and volumes
albert placed emphasis on experiment as well as investigation but he respected authority and tradition so much that many of his investigations or experiments were unpublished albert would often keep silent about many issues such as astronomy physics and such because he felt that his theories were too advanced for the time in which he was living name kennedy 
in the centuries since his death many stories arose about albert as an  and magician much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works particularly the alchemical work known as the secreta alberti or the experimenta alberti were falsely attributed to albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through associationkatz david a an illustrated history of alchemy and early chemistry 1978  on the subject of alchemy and chemistry many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject and then mostly through commentary on aristotle for example in his commentary de mineralibus he ers to the power of stones but does not elaborate on what these powers might begeorg wieland albert der grosse  der entwurf einer eigenständigen philosophie philosophen des mittelalters darmstadt primus 2000 124 39  a wide range of pseudo albertine works dealing with alchemy exist though showing the belief developed in the generations following alberts death that he had mastered alchemy one of the fundamental sciences of the middle ages these include metals and materials the secrets of chemistry the origin of metals the origins of compounds and a concordance which is a collection of observations on the  and other alchemy chemistry topics collected under the name of theatrum chemicumwalsh john the thirteenth greatest of centuries 190746http  booksgooglecom booksid _rofaaaaiaajamppg ra2 pa46ampdq albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#pra2 pa46m1 available online  he is credited with the discovery of the element  name buildingblocks451 3  and experimented with photosensitive chemicals including    he did believe that stones had occult properties as he related in his work de mineralibus however there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments
according to legend albert is said to have discovered the philosophers stone and passed it to his pupil thomas aquinas shortly before his death albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by transmutationjulian franklyn and frederick e budd a survey of the occult electric book company 2001 p 28 30 isbn 1 84327 087 0  given that thomas aquinas died six years before alberts death this legend as stated is unlikely
in his little book of alchemy albert said that alchemic gold and iron lack the properties of natural gold and iron alchemical iron not being magnetic and alchemical gold turning to powder after several ignitions
albert was deeply interested in astrology as has been articulated by scholars such as paola zambellipaola zambelli the speculum astronomiae and its enigma dordrecht  throughout the middle agesampnbsp–and well into the early modern periodampnbsp–astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm the latter being the cosmos itself it was believed that correspondence theore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth with this worldview it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being albert made this a central component of his philosophical system arguing that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with christian preceptsscott e hendrix how albert the greats speculum astronomiae was interpreted and used by four centuries of readers lewiston 2010 44 46  the most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260 now known as the  however details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote from his early de natura boni to his last work the summa theologiaehendrix 195 
albert believed that all natural things were composed of composition of matter and form he erred to it as quod est and quo est albert also believed that god alone is the absolute ruling entity alberts version of  is very similar to the  doctrine but he also took some concepts from avicennakovach francs and rober shahan albert the great commemorative essays  norman oklahoma university of oklahoma press 1980 p 133 135  liber phisicorum sive auditus phisici is an eight book commentary which albert wrote in france before 1349 on aristotle’s physics name upenn 
albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on aristotles poetics he rejected the idea of  as ridiculous movement of astronomical bodies he supposed is incapable of generating sound he wrote extensively on proportions in music and on the three different subjective levels on which  could work on the human soul purging of the impure illumination leading to contemplation and nourishing perfection through contemplation of particular interest to 20th century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music
both of his early treatises de natura boni and de bono start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good albert ers to the physical good as bonum naturae albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics in alberts later works he says in order to understand human or moral goodness the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds this procedure lects alberts preoccupations with neo platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of pseudo dionysiuscunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p 93  alberts view was highly valued by the catholic church and his peers
albert devoted the last tractatus of de bono to a theory of justice and  albert places god as the pinnacle of justice and natural law god legislates and divine authority is supreme up until his time it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosophercunningham stanley reclaiming moral agency the moral philosophy of albert the great washington dc the catholic university of america press 2008 p207

the period of alboins reign as king in pannonia following the death of his father  was one of confrontation and conflict between the lombards and their main neighbors the gepids the gepids initially gained the upper hand but in 567 thanks to his alliance with the  alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies whose lands the avars subsequently occupied the increasing power of his new neighbours caused alboin some unease however and he theore decided to leave pannonia for italy hoping to take advantage of the s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the

alboin was assassinated on june 28 572 in a  instigated by the byzantines it was organized by the kings foster brother  with the support of alboins wife  daughter of the gepid king whom alboin had killed some years earlier the coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the lombards who elected  as alboins successor forcing helmichis and rosamund to flee to  under imperial protection alboins death deprived the lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn germanic entity together the last in the line of hero kings who had led the lombards through their migrations from the vale of the  to italy for many centuries following his death alboins heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in saxon and bavarian epic poetry
the lombards under king  had migrated towards the east into pannonia taking advantage of the difficulties facing the  in italy following the death of its founder  in 526 wachos death in about 540 brought his son  to the throne but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by alboins father audoin of the  clan seven years later walthari died giving audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning jarnut 1995 pp 16–18

faced with the possibility of annihilation alboin made an alliance in 566 with the  under  at the expense of some tough conditions the avars demanded a tenth of the lombards cattle half of the war booty and on the wars conclusion all of the lands held by the gepids the lombards played on the pre existing hostility between the avars and the byzantines claiming that the latter were allied with the gepids cunimund on the other hand encountered hostility when he once again asked the emperor for military assistance as the byzantines had been angered by the gepids failure to cede sirmium to them as had been agreed moreover justin ii was moving away from the foreign policy of justinian and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples attempts to mollify justin ii with tributes failed and as a result the byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the avars name dbi pohl 1997 pp 96–97 
in 567 the allies made their final move against cunimund with alboin invading the gepids lands from the northwest while bayan attacked from the northeast cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the lombards and clashing with alboin somewhere between the  and  rivers the gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle their king slain by alboin and cunimunds daughter rosamund taken captive according to erences in the origo the full destruction of the gepid kingdom was completed by the avars who overcame the gepids in the east as a result the gepids ceased to exist as an independent people and were partly absorbed by the lombards and the avars name dbi  name jj22 rovagnati 2003 pp 30–31  some time before 568 alboins first wife chlothsind died and after his victory against cunimund alboin married rosamund to establish a bond with the remaining gepids name sg20gasparri 1990 p 20  the war also marked a watershed in the geo political history of the region as together with the lombard migration the following year it signalled the end of six centuries of germanic dominance in the pannonian basincurta 2001 p 204 
despite his success against the gepids alboin had failed to greatly increase his power and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the avars name jj29jarnut 1995 p 29  historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing alboin to undertake a migration even though there are indications that before the war with the gepids a decision was maturing to leave for italy a country thousands of lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the byzantines to fight in the gothic war name dbi  name jm152moorhead 2005 p 152  additionally the lombards would have known of the weakness of byzantine italy which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the goths in particular the so called  had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic with the  sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula  was recalledchristie 1998 p 60  nevertheless the lombards viewed italy as a rich land which promised great booty name jj29  name sg25gasparri 1990 p 25  assets alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only lombards but many other peoples of the region including       the remaining romans and a few ostrogoths but the most important group other than the lombards were the  of whom 20000 participated in the trek these saxons were tributaries to the frankish king  and their participation indicates that alboin had the support of the franks for his venture name dbi  name hs82schutz 2002 p 82 
the precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by alboin is impossible to know and many different estimates have been made  considers 150000 to be a realistic size a number which would make the lombards a more numerous force than the ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of italy jörg jarnut proposes 100000–150000 as an approximation wilfried menghen in die langobarden estimates 150000 to 200000 while stefano gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by alboin to be somewhere between 100000 and 300000 name sg25  name hs82  name nc634christie 1998 pp 63–64  name jj30jarnut 1995 p 30 
as a precautionary move alboin strengthened his alliance with the avars signing what paul calls a foedus perpetuum perpetual treaty and what is erred to in the 9th century  as a pactum et foedus amicitiae pact and treaty of friendship adding that the treaty was put down on paper by the conditions accepted in the treaty the avars were to take possession of pannonia and the lombards were promised military support in italy should the need arise also for a period of 200ampnbspyears the lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer italy failed thus leaving alboin with an alternative open the accord also had the advantage of protecting alboins rear as an avar occupied pannonia would make it difficult for the byzantines to bring forces to italy by land the agreement proved immensely successful and relations with the avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the lombard kingdompohl 1997 p 98  name hw286wolfram 1997 p 286 jarnut 1995 pp 29–30 
a further cause of the lombard migration into italy may have been an invitation from narses according to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources narses out of spite for having been removed by justinians successor justin ii called the lombards to italy often dismissed as an unreliable tradition name jj30 whitby 2001 p 91  it has been studied with attention by modern scholars in particular neil christie who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the byzantine state to settle in northern italy as  to help protect the region against the franks an arrangement that may have been disowned by justin ii after narses removal name jm152 christie 1998 pp 60–63 pohl 1997 pp 98–99  name rc186collins 1991 p 186

the lombard migration started on easter monday april 2 568 the decision to combine the departure with a christian celebration can be understood in the context of alboins recent conversion to  as attested by the presence of arian gothic missionaries at his court name jm152  name sp43palmieri 1996 pp 43–44  the conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations and intended to consolidate the migrations cohesion distinguishing them from the catholic romans it also connected alboin and his people to the gothic heritage and in this way obtain the support of the ostrogoths serving in the byzantine army as foederati name dbi gasparri 1990 pp 24–25  it has been speculated that alboins migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving ostrogoths in italy name jm152 
the season chosen for leaving pannonia was unusually early the germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march the reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring avars despite the friendship treaty nomadic peoples like the avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns as they needed enough forage for their horses a sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by alboin to ravage pannonia which created a safety zone between the lombards and the avars name hw286  name rc186 
the road followed by alboin to reach italy has been the subject of controversy as is the length of the trek according to neil christie the lombards divided themselves into migrational groups with a vanguard scouting the road probably following the  –  –  –  route while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them and possibly also because they were waiting for the saxons to join them on the road by september raiding parties were looting  but it was probably only in 569 that the  were crossed at the  the eyewitness  gives the date as may 20 or 21 name dbi  name sg25  name nc634  the 569 date for the entry into italy is not void of difficulties however and jörg jarnut believes the conquest of most of venetia had already been completed in 568 according to carlo guido mor a major difficulty remains in explaining how alboin could have reached milan on september 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the may of the same year name jj30  name sp43

the lombards penetrated into italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops  the byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty and the border forts may well have been left unmanned what seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated this agrees with paul the deacons narrative who speaks of a lombard takeover in  without any hindrancechristie 1998 pp 73 76 
the first town to fall into the lombards hands was  cividale del friuli the seat of the local magister militum name dbi  alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the  and made his nephew and    of the region with the specific duty of defending the borders from byzantine or avar attacks from the east gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those  or clans that he perred name jj30 christie 1998 pp 93–94  name hw2878wolfram 1997 pp 287–288 
alboins decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations until then the lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town the innovation adopted was part of alboins borrowing of roman and ostrogothic administrative models as in late antiquity the   city count was the main local authority with full administrative powers in his region but the shift from count comes to duke dux and from county comitatus to duchy ducatus also signalled the progressive militarization of italy name hw2878  the selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in pannonia for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the lombards now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in forum iulii a pattern that was repeated regularly by the lombards in their other duchieschristie 1998 p 77

from aquileia alboin took the  and swept through venetia taking in rapid succession  treviso  vicenza    and  bergamo the lombards faced difficulties only in taking  oderzo which alboin decided to avoid as he similarly avoided tackling the main venetian towns closer to the coast on the  such as   padova  monselice  and  name dbi  name hw288  the invasion of venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil spurring waves of ugees from the lombard controlled interior to the byzantine held coast often led by their bishops and resulting in new settlements such as  and lane 1991 p 7  name cah19humphries 2001 pp 535–536 richards 1979 p 34 
alboin moved west in his march invading the region of  north west italy and reaching its capital   on september 3 569 only to find it already abandoned by the  italiae vicar of italy the authority entrusted with the administration of the  archbishop  his clergy and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius italiae to find a safe haven in the byzantine port of  genoa alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of milan when he assumed the title of dominus italiae lord of italy his success also meant the collapse of byzantine defences in the northern part of the  and large movements of ugees to byzantine areas name plre3  name dbi christie 1998 p 78  name sg256gasparri 1990 pp 25–26 
several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial lombard advance in northern italy it has been suggested that the towns doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the gothic auxiliaries in the byzantine army but historians generally hold that lombard success occurred because italy was not considered by byzantium as a vital part of the empire especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of avars and  in the  and  in the east the byzantine decision not to contest the lombard invasion lects the desire of justinians successors to reorient the core of the empires polices eastward name sg256  name jj31 ostrogorsky 1993 p 68 
the impact of the lombard migration on the late roman aristocracy was disruptive especially in combination with the gothic war the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562 when the last gothic stronghold verona was taken name rc187collins 1991 p 187  many men of means pauls possessores either lost their lives or their goods but the exact extent of the despoliation of the roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate name jj31jarnut 1995 p 31 wickham 2005 pp 203 210 moorhead 2005 pp 156–157  the clergy was also greatly affected the lombards were mostly pagans and displayed little respect for the clergy and church property many churchmen left their  to escape from the lombards like the two most senior bishops in the north honoratus and paulinus however most of the s in the north sought an accommodation with the lombards as did in 569 the bishop of tarvisium  when he journeyed to the  to parley with alboin obtaining respect for the church and its goods in return for this act of homage it seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years the transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the  in lombard territory churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution name jj31 wolfram 1997 pp 288–289 richards 1979 pp 37–38 
in the view of pierre riché the disappearance of 220 bishops seats indicates that the lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the church name hs84schutz 2001 p 84  yet according to walter pohl the regions directly occupied by alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact with the bishoprics in such places rarely survivingpohl 1997 pp 124–125 
the first attested instance of strong resistance to alboins migration took place at the town of   which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years the town was of strategic importance sitting at the confluence of the rivers  and  and connected by waterways to ravenna the capital of byzantine italy and the seat of the  its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the  and the  name dbi  name jj30 christie 1998 p 79  name sg26gasparri 1990 p 26  name hw290wolfram 1997 p 290

alboins problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of ticinum the nature of the lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by theodoric over his goths and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces who led each band fara of warriors additionally the difficulties encountered by alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy as unlike the ostrogoths they had not entered italy as foederati but as enemies of the empire name dbi  name cah19 azzara 2009 pp 95–96  name wp99pohl 1997 p 99 
the kings disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of frankish  which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale the lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following  victory at  these attacks had lasting political consequences souring the previously cordial lombard frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the empire and the franks against the lombards a coalition agreed to by  in about 571 name plre3  name dbi  name hw290  name wp99 jarnut 1995 p 35  alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by gian piero bognetti is that alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on guntram as part of an alliance with the frankish king of   this view is met with scepticism by scholars such as wickham 1989 pp 30–31 
the weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern italy by the lombards in which modern scholars believe alboin played no role at all probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords however it is far from certain that the lombard takeover occurred during those years as very little is known of  and zottos respective rise to power in   and   name wp99 palmieri 1996 pp 52–53 moorhead 2005 p 153 christie 1998 pp 80–82

ticinum eventually fell to the lombards in either may or june 572 alboin had in the meantime chosen verona as his seat establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by theodoric this choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the gothic king name dbi 
it was in this palace that alboin was killed on june 28 572 in the account given by paul the deacon the most detailed narrative on alboins death history and saga intermingle almost inextricably much earlier and shorter is the story told by  in his chronica written about a decade after alboins murder according to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him called  pauls helmechismartindale 1992 sv hilmegis p 599  with the connivance of the queen helmichis then married the widow but the two were forced to escape to byzantine ravenna taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army which hints at the cooperation of byzantium  describes marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to lombard italy name plre3  name dbi collins 1991 pp 187–188 jarnut 1995 pp 31–32 
also contemporary is  account presented in the historia francorum and echoed by the later  gregorys account diverges in several respects from most other sources in his tale it is told how alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge eventually poisoning him she had previously fallen in love with one of her husbands servants and after the assassination tried to escape with him but they were captured and killed however historians including walter goffart place little trust in this narrative goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the historia and calls its account of alboins demise a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity name wg392goffart 1988 p 392 
elements present in marius account are echoed in pauls  which also contains distinctive features one of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the  in paul the events that lead to alboins downfall unfold in verona during a great feast alboin gets drunk and orders his wife rosamund to drink from his cup made from the skull of his father in law cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married rosamund alboin invited her to drink merrily with her father this reignited the queens determination to avenge her father name hs84  name sg1921gasparri 1990 pp 19–21  name hw291wolfram 1997 p 291  name wg391392goffart 1988 pp 391–392 
the tale has been often dismissed as a fable and paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief for this reason he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of ticinum in the hands of king  the use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and in particular among the lombards neighbours the avars skull cups are believed to be part of a  ritual where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead mans powers in this context stefano gasparri and wilfried menghen see in cunimunds skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the lombards by drinking from his enemys skull alboin was taking his vital strength as for the offering of the skull to rosamund that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the lombards and thus a cause of shame or humiliation alternatively it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation in the latter interpretation the queens answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge name hs84  name sg1921  name wg391392 
the episode is read in a radically different way by walter goffart according to him the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning with paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land because of his human weakness in this story the skull cup plays a key role as it unites  and barbarism goffart does not exclude the possibility that paul had really seen the skull but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established name hs84  name wg391392 
in her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in helmichis the kings foster brother and  arms bearer according to paul the queen then recruited the kings  bedchamberlain peredeo into the plot after having seduced him when alboin retired for his midday rest on june 28 care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded alboins sword was also removed leaving him defenceless when peredeo entered his room and killed him name plre3  name hw291  name jj32jarnut 1995 p 32  alboins remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps name wg392 
peredeos figure and role is mostly introduced by paul the origo had for the first time mentioned his name as peritheus but there his role had been different as he was not the assassin but the instigator of the assassination in the vein of his reading of the skull cup goffart sees peredeo as not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character he notes a similarity between peredeos name and the  word peritus meaning lost a representation of those lombards who entered into the service of the empire name wg393goffart 1988 p 393 
alboins death had a lasting impact as it deprived the lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn germanic entity his end also represents the death of the last of the line of the hero kings that had led the lombards through their migrations from the elba to italy his fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry with saxons and s celebrating his prowess in battle his heroism and the magical properties of his weapons name dbi  name sg20 wolfram 1997 p 285

to complete the  and legitimize his claim to the throne helmichis married the queen whose high standing arose not only from being the kings widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining gepid nation and as such her support was a guarantee of the gepids loyalty to helmichis the latter could also count on the support of the lombard garrison of verona where many may have opposed alboins aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the empire the byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot it was in their interest to stem the lombard tide by bringing a pro byzantine regime into power in verona and possibly in the long run break the unity of the lombards kingdom winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments name dbi  name sg26  name jj32  name nc82christie 1998 p 82  name hw292wolfram 1997 p 292 azzara 2009 p 96

 melanchrus – he was overthrown sometime between 612ampnbspbc and 609ampnbspbc by a faction that in addition to the brothers of alcaeus included  later renowned as one of the  alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved
 myrsilus – it is not known when he came to power but some verses by alcaeus frag 129 indicate that the poet his brothers and pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that pittacus subsequently betrayed them alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote a drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrants death frag 332
 pittacus – the dominant political figure of his time he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of mytilene and appears to have governed well 590 580ampnbspbc even allowing alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace
sometime before 600ampnbspbc mytilene fought athens for control of  and alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting according to the historian histories 595  the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend melanippus it is thought that alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile including at least one visit to egypt his older brother antimenidas appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of  and probably took part in the conquest of askelon alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of antimenides return including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent frag 350 and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home frag 357
alcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of  and since both poets composed for the entertainment of mytilenean friends they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis such as at the kallisteia an annual festival celebrating the islands federation under mytilene held at the messon erred to as temenos in frs 129 and 130 where sappho performed publicly with female choirs alcaeus erence to sappho in terms more typical of a divinity as holy pure honey smiling sappho fr 384 may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festivalgregory nagy lyric and greek myth in the cambridge companion to greek mythology ed r d woodward cambridge university press 2007 pp 19–51 http  chsharvardedu wa pagertn articlewrapperampbdc 12ampmn 2654  the lesbian or aeolic school of poetry reached in the songs of sappho and alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after wards approachedjames s easby smith the songs of alcaeus w h lowdermilk and co washington 1901  and it was assumed by later greek critics and during the early centuries of the christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers a theme which became a favourite subject in art as in the urn pictured above
the poetic works of alcaeus were collected into ten books with elaborate commentaries by the alexandrian scholars  and  sometime in the 3rd century bc and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form varying in size from mere phrases such as wine window into a man fr 333 to entire groups of verses and stanzas such as those quoted below fr 346 alexandrian scholars numbered him in their  one lyric poet per muse among these  was held by many ancient critics to be pre eminent http  penelopeuchicagoedu thayer e roman texts quintilian institutio_oratoria 10ahtml#161 10161 cf  http  classicpersuasionorg pw longinus desub011htm#xxxiii 335  but some gave precedence to alcaeus instead name digitized1james easby smith the songs of alcaeus digitized without page numbers  the canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups with alcaeus sappho and  being monodists or solo singers with the following characteristicsandrew mmiller trans greek lyric an anthology in translation hackett publishing co 1996 intro xiii 
 they composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them
 they wrote in their native dialects alcaeus and sappho in aeolic dialect anacreon in ionic
 they perred quite short metrically simple stanzas or strophes which they re used in many poems — hence the alcaic and sapphic stanzas named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them
the other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses however this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance even the private lections of alcaeus ostensibly sung at dinner parties still retain a public function name university19gregory nagy lyric and greek myth in the cambridge companion to greek mythology ed r d woodward cambridge university press 2007 pp 19–51 
critics often seek to understand alcaeus in comparison with sappho
the roman poet horace also compared the two describing alcaeus as more full throatedly singing name classics116james michie trans the odes of horace penguin classics 1964 p 116  — see  below alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own down to earth style and sapphos more celestial qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess as cited above and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane each emphasising different elements in that balance name university19 
 exhorts us to observe in alcaeus the sublimity brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power his splendid figures and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairsimit 422 quoted from easby smith in songs of alcaeus  while  after commending alcaeus for his excellence in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals in his language he is concise exalted caul and often like an orator goes on to add but he descended into wantonnness and amours though better fitted for higher thingsquintillian 10163 quoted by dcampbell in glp p 288 
the works of alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres
 political songs alcaeus often composed on a political theme covering the power struggles on lesbos with the passion and vigour of a partisan cursing his opponentsfr 129  rejoicing in their deaths name autogenerated1fr 332  delivering blood curdling homilies on the consequences of political inactionfr s262  and exhorting his comrades to heroic defiance as in one of his ship of state allegoriesfr 6  commenting on alcaeus as a political poet the scholar  once observed that if you removed the meter you would find political rhetoricimit 422 quoted by campbell in glp p 286 
 drinking songs according to the grammarian  alcaeus made every occasion an excuse for drinking and he has provided posterity several quotes in proof of itathenaeus 10430c  alcaeus exhorts his friends to drink in celebration of a tyrants death name autogenerated1fr 332  to drink away their sorrowsfrs 335 346  to drink because life is shortfr 38a  and along the lines in vino veritasfr 333  to drink through winter stormsfr 338  and to drink through the heat of summerfr 347  the latter poem in fact paraphrases verses from hesiod op 582–8  re casting them in asclepiad meter and aeolian dialect
 hymns alcaeus sang about the gods in the spirit of the  to entertain his companions rather than to glorify the gods and in the same meters that he used for his secular lyricsdavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 p 286  there are for example fragments in sapphic meter praising the fr 34a  fr 308b  and the river fr 45  a river significant in lesbian mythology since it was down its waters that the head of  was believed to have floated singing eventually crossing the sea to lesbos and ending up in a temple of apollo as a symbol of lesbian supremacy in songdavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 pp 292–3  according to  the hymn to hermes was imitated by horace in one of his own sapphic odes c110 mercuri facunde nepos atlantisdavid campbell monody in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and e kenney eds cambridge university press 1985 p 213 
 love songs almost all alcaeus amorous verses mentioned with disapproval by quintilian above have vanished without trace there is a brief erence to his love poetry in a passage by cicero tusc disp 471   who often wrote in imitation of alcaeus sketches in verse one of the lesbian poets favourite subjects — lycus of the black hair and eyes c13211 12 nigris oculis nigroque crine decorum it is possible that alcaeus wrote amorously about sappho as indicated in an earlier quotefr 384 
 miscellaneous alcaeus wrote on such a wide variety of subjects and themes that contradictions in his character emerge the grammarian athenaeus quoted some verses about perfumed ointments to prove just how unwarlike alcaeus could befr 362 athenaeus 15687d  and he quoted his description of the armour adorning the walls of his housefr 357  as proof that he could be unusually warlike for a lyric poetathenaeus 14627a  other examples of his readiness for both warlike and unwarlike subjects are lyrics celebrating his brothers heroic exploits as a babylonian mercenaryfr 350  and  lyrics sung in a rare meter sapphic ionic in minore in the voice of a distressed girlfr 10b  wretched me who share in all ills — possibly imitated by horace in an ode in the same meter c312 miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci name literature214david campbell monody in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and e kenney eds cambridge university press 1985 p 214  he also wrote sapphic stanzas on homeric themes but in unhomeric style comparing  unfavourably with  the mother of fr 42 
the following verses demonstrate some key characteristics of the alcaic style square brackets indicate uncertainties in the ancient text
david a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 p 60 
lets drink why are we waiting for the lamps only an inch of daylight left
lift down the large cups my friends the painted ones
for wine was given to men by the son of semele and zeus
to help them forget their troubles mix one part of water to two of wine
pour it in up to the brim and let one cup push the other alongandrew mmiller trans greek lyric an anthology in translation hackett publishing co 1996 p 48 
the greek meter here is relatively simple comprising the greater  adroitly used to convey for example the rhythm of jostling cups   the language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences — the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning comprising an exhortation lets drink a rhetorical question why are we waiting for the lamps and a justifying statement only an inch of daylight leftdavid campbell monody in the cambridge history of classical literature greek literature p easterling and e kenney eds cambridge university press 1985 p 212  the meaning is clear and uncomplicated the subject is drawn from personal experience and there is an absence of poetic ornament such as simile or metaphor like many of his poems eg frs 38 326 338 347 350 it begins with a verb in this case lets drink and it includes a proverbial expression only an inch of daylight left though it is possible that he coined it himself name david a 1982 page 287 
alcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm tossed ship of state the following fragment of a hymn to castor and polydeuces the  is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyagedavid a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classical press 1982 pp 286 289 
hither now to me from your isle of pelops
you powerful children of zeus and leda
showing youselves kindly by nature castor
and polydeuces
travelling abroad on swift footed horses
over the wide earth over all the ocean
how easily you bring deliverance from
deaths gelid rigor
landing on tall ships with a sudden great bound
a far away light up the forestays running
bringing radiance to a ship in trouble
sailed in the darkness
the poem was written in s a verse form popularly associated with his compatriot sappho but in which he too excelled here paraphrased in english to suggest the same rhythms there were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remaindavid a campbell greek lyric vol i loeb classical library 1990 p 247  the far away light  is a erence to  an electrical discharge supposed by ancient greek mariners to be an epiphany of the dioscuri but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by a modern scholar—such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry see  below this poem doesnt begin with a verb but with an adverb Δευτέ but still communicates a sense of action he probably performed his verses at  for friends and political allies—men for whom loyalty was essential particularly in such troubled times name literature214 
the roman poet  modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of alcaeus rendering the lesbian poets verse forms including alcaic and sapphic stanzas into concise latin — an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odeshorace od 330  in his second book in an ode composed in alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm he imagines meeting alcaeus and sappho in

the story of alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion name archive1901 david a campbell greek lyric poetry bristol classic press 1982 pp 285–305  his verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition — generations of scribes copying an authors collected works such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of s odes — but haphazardly in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at  and other locations in egypt sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively adding little by little to the worlds store of poetic fragments

very little documentary evidence is available from ealdreds time as bishop of worcester only five leases that he signed survive and all date from 1051 to 1053 two further leases exist in  as copies only how the  was administered when ealdred was abroad is unclear although it appears that  the prior of the  performed the religious duties in the diocese on the financial side the  states that  who became abbot of  in 1058 administered worcester before he became abbot name king134king ealdred anglo norman studies xviii pp 134–137 
cynesige the archbishop of york died on 22 december 1060 and ealdred was elected  on christmas day 1060 although a bishop was promptly appointed to heord none was named to worcester and it appears that ealdred intended to retain worcester along with york which several of his predecessors had done name king130  there were a few reasons for this one of which was political as the kings of england perred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism another reason was that york was not a wealthy see and worcester was holding worcester along with york allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself name loyn158loyn governance p 158

after ealdreds death one of the restraints on williams treatment of the english was removed name barlow57  ealdred was one of a few native englishmen who william appears to have trusted and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate englishmen into the administration although such efforts did not entirely stop name bates156bates william the conqueror p 156  in 1070 a church council was held at westminster and a number of bishops were deposed by 1073 there were only two englishmen in episcopal sees and by the time of williams death in 1089 there was only one  of worcester name barlow57barlow english church 1066–1154 p 57

alexander i jagiellon   5 august 1461 – 19 august 1506 of the  was the grand duke of  and later also king of   he was the fourth son of  he was elected grand duke of lithuania on the death of his father 1492 and king of poland on the death of his brother  1501
alexander was born as son of the king  of  and  daughter of the king  alexanders shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the polish senate and nobility  who deprived him of control of the mint then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the polish kings curtailed his prerogatives and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position for want of funds alexander was unable to resist the grand master of the  or prevent grand duke of muscovy  from ravaging  with the  the most the grand duke of lithuania could do was to garrison  and other strongholds and employ his wife helena the tsars daughter to mediate a truce between his father in law and himself after the disastrous  1500 in the terms of the truce lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist russian state
during his reign poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality  only the death of  the great  of moldavia enabled poland still to hold her own on the  while the liberality of  who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander  and other financial help enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order
alexander jagellon never felt at home in poland and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate  who justified his masters confidence by his great victory over the tatars at  5 august 1506 news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in  there is some evidence that he had at least one son leading to a surviving jagiellonian branch although this is not conclusivehttp  ciekawostkihistorycznepl 2011 12 28 krolewska poradnia malzenska aleksander jagiellonczyk i helena moskiewska  
it is important to note that alexander was the last known ruler of the  dynasty to have maintained the familys ancestral  from his death polish became the sole language of the family thus fully  the  family

alexander iii  or alexander alexandrovich romanov  10 march 1845 – 1 november 1894 was the penultimate  of   and  from  until his death on  he was highly  and reversed some of the liberal orms of his father  during alexanders reign russia fought no major wars for which he was styled the peacemaker 
grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on 10 march 1845 at the  in   the second son of   and his wife 
in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft hearted liberal father and still less to his ined philosophic sentimental chivalrous yet cunning great uncle emperor  who could have been given the title of the first gentleman of  although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the  alexander was seen as lacking inement and elegance indeed he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects his straightforward abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness while his direct unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough hewn immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities more than six feet tall about 19ampnbspm he was also noted for his immense physical strength a   on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent
an account from the memoirs of the artist  gives one impression of alexander iii
blockquoteafter a performance of the ballet  at the  i first caught sight of the emperor i was struck by the size of the man and although cumbersome and heavy he was still a mighty figure there was indeed something of the  russian peasant about him the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me as he passed where i was standing he raised his head for a second and to this day i can remember what i felt as our eyes met it was a look as cold as steel in which there was something threatening even frightening and it struck me like a blow the tsars gaze the look of a man who stood above all others but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him in later years i came into contact with the emperor on several occasions and i felt not the slightest bit timid in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind simple and even almost homely blockquote
though he was destined to be a strongly counter orming emperor alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life as he had an elder brother  who seemed of robust constitution even when this elder brother first displayed symptoms of delicate health the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously and he was betrothed to  daughter of  and  of denmark and whose siblings included  and  great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicolas as  whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period this included acquaintance with   and  and 
alexander became  as  with nicholass sudden death in 1865 it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under  then a professor of  at  and later from 1880  of the  of the orthodox church in russia pobedonostsev awakened in his pupil little love of abstract study or prolonged intellectual exertion but instilled into the young mans mind the belief that zeal for  thought was an essential factor of russian  to be cultivated by every right minded emperor while he was heir apparent—1865 to 1881—alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government
on his deathbed alexanders elder brother nicolas is said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée princess dagmar of denmark should marry his successor this wish was swiftly realized when on  in the imperial chapel of the  in  alexander wed dagmar who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name  the union proved a happy one to the end unlike his fathers there was no adultery in his marriage
later on tsesarevich alexander became estranged from  his father not only did tsesarevich alexander disagree with the political views of alexander ii but he also was indignant by his fathers long standing relationship with  with whom alexander ii had several illegitimate children while his mother  was suffering from chronic ill healthvan der kiste john the romanovs 1818–1959 sutton publishing 2003 p 94  to the scandal of many at court including tsesarevich alexander alexander ii married catherine only a month after empress marie alexandrovnas death in 1880
on 1 march 1881 os alexanders father emperor  was assassinated by members of the  organization  as a result he ascended to the russian imperial throne in  on 13 march 1881 he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed on 27 may 1883
on the day of his assassination alexander ii had signed an  setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch on ascending to the throne however alexander iii took s advice and canceled the policy before its publication he made it clear that his  would not be limited
all of alexander iiis internal orms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his fathers reign the new emperor believed that remaining true to russian  the ideology introduced by his grandfather emperor  would save russia from revolutionary agitation alexanders political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality language and religion as well as one form of administration he attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the  throughout the empire including to his   and other non russian subjects with the exception of the  by the patronization of y  by the destruction of the remnants of german polish and  institutions in the respective provinces and by the weakening of  through persecution of the s the latter policy was implemented in the  of 1882 which banned jews from inhabiting rural areas and s even within the  and restricted the occupations in which they could engage 
alexander weakened the power of the  elective local administrative bodies resembling british s and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land owning proprietors appointed by his government these land captains zemskiye nachalniki were feared and resented throughout the empires peasant communities these acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought imperial administration under the emperors personal control
in such policies emperor alexander iii had the encouragement of  who retained control of the church in russia through his long  procuratorship of the holy synod from 1880 to 1905 and who became tutor to alexanders son and heir nicolas pobedonostsev appesars as toporov in tolstoys novel resurrection other conservative advisors included count  minister of education and later of internal affairs and  d a tolstoys successor in the latter post  and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy – as did the novelist 
encouraged by its successful assassination of alexander ii the  movement began planning the murder of alexander iii the  uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators including  the older brother of  were captured and hanged on  on  the imperial train  in an  at  at the moment of the crash the royal family was in the dining car its roof collapsed and alexander supposedly held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors the onset of alexander’s kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident
the famine of 1891–1892 and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity as the russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief among others  helped organize soup kitchens and  directed anti cholera precautions in several villages
in foreign affairs alexander iii was a man of peace but not at any price and held that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it though he was indignant at the conduct of german chancellor  towards russia he avoided an open rupture with  and even revived the  for a period of time and in 1887 signed the  with the germans however in 1890 the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of bismarck by the new german emperor  for whom the tsar had an immense dislike and the wilhelm governments unwillingness to renew the treatyvan der kiste john the romanovs 1818–1959 sutton publishing 2003 p 162  in response alexander iii then began cordial relations with france eventually entering into an  with the french in 1892
despite chilly relations with berlin the tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the german frontier with regard to bulgaria he exercised similar self control the efforts of prince alexander and afterwards of  to destroy russian influence in the principality excited his indignation but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms
in n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending russian domination without provoking conflict with the  see  and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand his reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of  but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress
alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at  manor near  on the  coast where their children were immersed in a scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty
alexander deprecated foreign influence and german influence in particular so the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity with a view to realizing his ideal of a russia homogeneous in language administration and religion with such ideas he had not  been able to be in cordial agreement with his father who though a patriot had german sympathies often used the german language in his private relations occasionally ridiculed the  and based his foreign policy on the prussian alliance 
some differences had first appeared during the  when alexander ii supported the cabinet of  while the tsesarevich did not conceal his sympathies for the french it had reappeared during the years 1875–1879 when the  excited russian society at first the tsesarevich was more slavophile than the government but his  nature preserved him from many exaggerations and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in  where he commanded the left wing of the invading army  never consulted on political questions alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner after many mistakes and disappointments the army reached  and the  was signed but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the

the tsesarevich could point to these results as confirming the views he had expressed during the franco prussian war and he concluded that for russia the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization in accordance with this conviction he suggested that certain orms should be introduced
following his fathers assassination alexander iii was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the winter palace as a result alexander relocated his family to the  located twenty miles south of st petersburg making it his primary residence under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into st petersburg but even then he would stay in the  as opposed to the winter palace
in the 1860s alexander fell madly in love with his mothers lady in waiting princess maria elimovna meshcherskaya dismayed to learn that prince wittgenstein had made her a proposal in spring 1866 he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights to the sovereignty in order to marry his beloved dusenka on 19 may 1866 alexander ii informed his son that russia had come to an agreement with the parents of princess dagmar of denmark his tenth cousin before then she had been the fiancée of his elder brother nicholas who had died in 1865 but alexander used to travel to copenhagen declaring that he did not love dagmar and wanted to marry maria the emperor flew into a rage and ordered alexander to go straight to denmark and to propose to princess dagmar the tsesarevich realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first the only thing left to do was to write in his diary farewell dear dusenka maria was forced to leave russia accompanied by her aunt princess chernyshova almost a year after her first appearance in paris  fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867 maria died giving birth to a child  alexanders reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown
alexander was happily married to maria feodorovna formerly princess dagmar of denmark and was the father of six children five of whom survived into adulthood  b 1868  b 1871  b 1875  1878 and  b 1882 of his five surviving children he was closest to his youngest two

the dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between alexander and henry of england in 1114 he joined henry on campaign in wales against  of oram p 65  alexanders marriage with henrys illegitimate daughter  may have occurred as early as 1107 or as at late as 1114oram p 65 a date around 1114 would place the marriage at about the same time as that of david and

alexander i or aleksandar obrenović  Александар Обреновић 14 august 1876 – 11 june 1903 was king of  from 1889 to 1903 when he and his wife queen draga were  by a group of army officers  led by captain 
in 1889 alexanders father  unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life proclaiming alexander king of serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age his mother  became his regent his parents were second cousins
in 1893 king alexander aged sixteen arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age dismissed the s and their government and took the royal authority into his own hands his action won popular support as did his appointment of a radical ministry
in may 1894 king alexander arbitrarily abolished king milans liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869 his attitude during the  was one of strict 
in 1894 the young king brought his father milan back to serbia and in 1898 appointed him commander in chief of the serbian army during that time milan was regarded as the de facto ruler of the country
in the summer of 1900 king alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed madame  formerly a lady in waiting to his mother and 12 years older than him the projected union initially aroused great opposition he did not consult with his father who had been on vacation in  and making arrangements to secure the hand of  princess  for his son or his  dr vladan Đorđević who was visiting the   at the time of the announcement both immediately resigned from their respective offices and alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet alexanders mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom she was known to have been seen in the nearby countries such as austria hungary and bulgaria
opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding the marriage duly took place in august 1900 even so the unpopularity of the union weakened the kings position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large
king alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a   of his own initiative introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of serbia the system of two chambers  and   this reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which already dissatisfied with the kings marriage became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of  lieutenant nikodije was to be proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne
meanwhile the independence of the  and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to king alexander in march 1903 the king suspended the  for half an hour time enough to publish the decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state this arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country
the general impression was that as much as the  was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections king alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim queen dragas brother as the  to the throne in spite of this it had been agreed with the serbian government that  who was married to  the granddaughter of  an aunt of king milan would be proclaimed heir presumptive in the event that the marriage of king alexander and queen draga was childless name njeg  
apparently to prevent queen dragas brother being named heir presumptive but in reality to replace alexander obrenović with  a conspiracy was organized by a group of army officers headed by captain  also known as apis and norman perović a young greek orthodox militant who was in the pay of the c l sulzberger the fall of eagles p202 crown publishers new york 1977  as well as the leader of the   which would assassinate  in 1914 several politicians were also part of the conspiracy and allegedly included former prime minister  name sulzberger p202sulzberger p202  the royal couples  was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the queens bedroom there is another possibility used in a serbian tv history series the end of the obrenović dynasty in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret  hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom the room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queens wardrobe over it after the wedding
the conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of may 29 1903 king alexander and queen draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and according to eyewitness accounts thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure name sulzberger p202  the king was only 26 years old at the time of his death king alexander and queen draga were buried in the crypt of

nevertheless although the sassanids were checked for the time name southern pg 62southern pg 62  the conduct of the  showed an extraordinary lack of discipline name canduci pg 61canduci pg 61  in 232 there was a mutiny in the syrian legion who proclaimed  emperorvictor 242  alexander managed to suppress the uprising and taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the  name canduci pg 59canduci pg 59   the emperor returned to  and celebrated a triumph in 233 name southern pg 62southern pg 62 
after the persian war alexander returned to antioch with the famous  one of the greatest fathers of the christian church alexanders mother julia mammaea asked for him to tutor alexander in  while alexander was being educated in the christian doctrines the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by germanic and sarmatian tribes a new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after alexanders success in the persian war in ad 234 the barbarians crossed the rhine and danube in hordes that even caused panic at the gates of rome the soldiers serving under alexander who were already demoralized after their costly war against the persians were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaderscampbell 54 
as word of the invasion spread the emperor took the front line and went to battle against the germanic invaders the romans prepared heavily for the war against the germanics building a brigade of ships to carry the entire battalion across however at this point in alexanders career he still knew little about being a general because of this he hoped the sole threat of his armies might be enough to persuade the germanics to surrender   severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among the germanic legions name western press association  due to incurring heavy losses against the persians and on the advice of his mother alexander attempted to buy the germanic tribes off so as to gain time
it was this decision that resulted in the  looking down upon alexander they considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be emperor under these circumstances  the army swiftly looked to replace alexander gaius iulius verus maximinus was the next best option he was a soldier from thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status name western press association  he was also a man with superior personal strength rising from peasantry to ultimately being the one chosen for the throne with the thracians hailing came the end of the severan dynasty name the saylor foundation  with his own army growing with animosity and turning against him the path for his assassination was paved
alexander was forced to face his german enemies in the early months of 235 by the time he and his mother arrived the situation had settled and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence trying to bribe the german army to surrender was the more sensible course of actioncanduci pg61  according to historians it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity pusillanimity was responsible for the revolt of alexander’s army resulting in severus falling victim to the swords of his own men name valentine nind hopkins 240  this was following the nomination of maximinus as emperor alexander was assassinated march 19 235 together with his mother in a mutiny of the  at  while at a meeting with his generals name southern pg 63southern pg 63   these assassinations secured the throne for maximinus name benario alexander severusbenario alexander severus 
 documents two theories that elaborate on the assassination of alexander severus the first claims that the disaffection of mammaea was the main motive behind the homicide however lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory where alexander is murdered in sicilia located in britain in an open tent after his lunch alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops they compared him to  a divisive and unpopular emperor whose own assassination paved the way for alexanders reign a german servant entered the tent and initiated the call for the emperor’s assassination an attack in which many of the troops joined alexanders attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the emperors assassination within minutes alexander was dead name valentine nind hopkins 240  after alexanders death his economic policies were completely discarded and the roman currency was devalued this marked the beginning of the crisis of the third century a time period in which the roman empire came close to falling apart entirely name the saylor foundation 
alexander was the last of the syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scalecampbell pg 55  his death signaled the end of the  and the beginning of the chaotic period known as the  which brought the empire to near collapse name canduci pg 61canduci pg 61 
alexanders death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for roman emperors though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during alexanders time emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs name campbell pg 69campbell pg 69  thus alexanders taking of his mothers advice not to get involved in battle his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the germanic threat and the relative failure of his military campaign against the persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers name campbell pg 69campbell pg 69  indeed maximinus was able to overthrow alexander by harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward  name campbell pg 69campbell pg 69   yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor the legions paved the way for a half century of widespread chaos and instability
alexanders reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline name campbell pg 196campbell pg 196  in 223 the  murdered their  ulpian name campbell pg 196   and did so in alexanders presence and despite the emperors pleas name canduci pg 61   the soldiers then fought a three day battle against the populace of rome and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire name campbell pg 197campbell pg 197  dio also gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time saying that they would rather just surrender to the enemy name campbell pg 197   different reasons are given for this breakdown of military discipline campbell points to blockquotethe decline in the prestige of the severan dynasty the feeble nature of alexander himself who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mothers advice and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure name campbell pg 197   blockquote
herodian on the other hand was convinced that the emperors miserliness partly the result of his mothers greed and slowness to bestow donatives were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under alexander name campbell pg 197  
according to canduci alexander is remembered as an emperor who was level headed well meaning and conscientious but his fatal flaw was his domination by his mother and grandmother name canduci pg 61   not only did this undermine his authority but his mothers influence was the cause of alexanders least popular actions convincing him not to take part in battle and trying to buy off the warring germanic barbarians

severus alexander became emperor when he was 13 years old making him the youngest emperor in romes history until the ascension of gordian iii his grandmother believed that he had more potential to rule than her other grandson the increasingly unpopular then emperor elagabaluscanduci pg 60  thus to preserve her own position she had elagabalus adopt the young alexander and then arranged for his assassination securing the throne for alexanderwells pg 266  the roman army hailed alexander emperor on march 13 222 immediately instilling him with the titles of augustus pater patriae and pontifex maximus throughout his life alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother maesa and mother mamaea alexanders grandmother died in 223 leaving his mother as the sole influence upon alexanders actions as a young immature and inexperienced 13 year old alexander knew little about government and the role of ruling over an empire because of this throughout his entire reign he was a puppet of his mothers advice and entirely under her jurisdiction a prospect that was not popular among the soldierscanduci pg 60 61 
alexander was married three times his most famous wife was   whom he married in 225 sallustia orbiana was 16 years old when marrying alexander severus as the result of an arranged marriage by alexanders mother julia mamaea however as soon as orbiana received the title of augusta mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of alexanders wife due to her excessive desire of all regal female titles name benario alexander severus   he divorced and exiled her in 227 after her father  was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the emperor name canduci pg 59canduci pg 59   another wife was sulpicia memmia a member of one of the most ancient patrician families in rome her father was a man of consular rank her grandfathers name was catulushistoria augusta life of severus alexander 203  the identity of alexanders third wife is unknown alexander fathered no children with all three wives
concerning religious matters alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel and had the motto do unto others as thou wouldst have them do unto thee inscribed on his palace and upon various public buildings he was extremely tolerant of not only christians but also  as he continued all privileges towards jews during his reign  alexander also claimedly placed images of abraham and jesus in his oratory along with other roman deities and classical figures

alexander jannaeus also known as alexander jannai yannai  אלכסנדר ינאי was king of  from 103ampnbspbc to 76ampnbspbc during the  the son of  he inherited the throne from his brother  and appears to have married his brothers widow shlomtzion or shelomit also known as  according to the biblical law of  levirate marriage although  is inexplicit on that point since alexander jannaeus was a high priest he was technically breaking jewish law according to the  the laws in leviticus state that a jewish high priest is forbidden to marry a widow the law in leviticus would have taken precedence over the biblical law in deuteronomy that allowed the marriage of a non high priest individual to a childless brothers widow
his likely full hebrew name was jonathan he may have been the high priest jonathan rather than his great uncle of the same name who established the  fortress under the name king yannai he appears as a wicked tyrant in the  lecting his conflict with the  party he is among the more colorful historical figures despite being little known outside specialized history he and his widow who became  after his death had a substantial impact on the subsequent development of judaism name dgrbm 
alexander jannaeus was the third son of john hyrcanus by his second wife when aristobulus i hyrcanus son by his first wife became king he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half brother aristobulus died after a reign of one year upon his death his widow  had alexander and his brothers released from prison name jehttp  jewishencyclopediacom articles 1144 alexander jannaeus jonathan alexander jannaeus jewish encyclopedia 
alexander as the oldest living brother had the right not only to the throne but also to salome the widow of his deceased brother who had died childless and although she was thirteen years older than he he married her by her he had two sons the eldest  became high priest in 62ampnbspbc and  who was high priest from 66   62ampnbspbc and started a bloody civil war with his brother ending in his capture by  
during the twenty seven year reign of alexander jannaeus he was almost constantly involved in military conflict international factors at the time created an environment suitable for jannaeus conquests first jannaeus received support from  this support was particularly crucial during the war with ptolemy lathyrus discussed later ultimately conflict in the  was the greatest outside influence on judean military campaigns political instability in rome led to a  beginning in 88ampnbspbc with rome chiefly concerned with a tumultuous domestic predicament jannaeus was free to expand the judean state
alexanders first expedition was against the  of ptolemais  this campaign seems to have been well timed politically as the weak  was unable to intervene help came to the citizens of ptolemais from  who had been cast out by his mother cleopatra iii and had founded a kingdom in 
ptolemy landed a large army for the relief of the town but alexander met him with treachery arranging an alliance with him openly while secretly he sought to obtain the help of his mother against him as soon as ptolemy learned of this intrigue he marched against  near sepphoris which he captured together with 10000 prisoners and much plunder a similar attack upon  failed but in a later battle at azophon on the jordan alexander with his whole army suffered a defeat at the hands of a much smaller force alexander allowed the enemy to cross the river unimpeded in order that as he thought he might more easily catch it between his army and the stream he saw his error only when it was too late the enemy fell upon the jewish camp women and children were struck down their corpses were hacked to pieces flung into caldrons and boiled so that the people thought they were dealing with cannibals this act was used to terrify the judean people and their military
alexander might easily have lost his crown and judea its independence as the result of this battle had it not been for the assistance extended by egypt cleopatras two jewish generals helkias and ananias persuaded the queen of the dangers of allowing her banished son ptolemy to remain victorious and she entrusted them with an army against him as a result ptolemy was forced to withdraw to cyprus and alexander was saved the egyptians as compensation for their aid desired to annex judea to their country but considerations touching the resident egyptian jews who were the main support of her throne induced cleopatra to modify her longings for conquest the egyptian army withdrawn alexander found his hands free and forthwith he planned new campaigns name je 
alexander captured  and the strong fortress  on the jordan but in an ambush set for him by theodorus ruler of amathus he lost the whole of the rear guard of his army—10000 men —together with his baggage he was more successful in his expedition against the hellenized coastal cities what had once been  capturing  and  finally in 96 bc  jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of  in a year long siege which he occupied through treachery and gave up to be pillaged and burned by his soldiery this victory gained judean control over the mediterranean outlet for the  trade routeshttp  wwwmfagovil mfa israelexperience history pages hasmonean rule extended to negev 10 dec 2009aspx hasmonean rule extended to negev highlands israel ministry of foreign affairs december 10 2009 
the relations between alexander and the pharisees were probably never very cordial though according to the statement of the talmud  the head of the party was a brother of the queen and a frequent guest at the palace name je 
the rival sadducees were avid supporters of jannaeus see 4q448 furthermore jannaeus established himself as a ruler concerned mainly with conquests rather than his religious obligations
one year during the jewish holiday of  alexander jannaeus while officiating as the  kohen gadol at the temple in jerusalem demonstrated his support of the  by using to perform the water  ceremony properly instead of pouring it on the altar he poured it on his feet the crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting alexander with the im s that they were holding in their hands unwittingly the crowd had played right into alexanders hands he had intended to incite the people to riot and his soldiers fell upon the crowd at his command the soldiers slew more than 6000 people in the temple courtyard
this incident during the feast of tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the judean civil war by igniting popular opponents of jannaeus a qumran document sheds further light on another opponent of jannaeus the scroll 4q390 was written by an adversary of jannaeus seeking popular support to overthrow the hasmonean king the author called for an end to the dispute between jannaeus and the pharisees according to the author the only acceptable solution was an end to the hasmonean priesthood and secular control this opposition culminated in the judean civil war
the judean civil war initially began after the conquest of gaza by jannaeus due to jannaeus victory at gaza the nabatean kingdom no longer controlled their main  to  theore nabatean king  launched an attack on judea in the  after jannaeus was defeated in battle against obodas he returned to fierce jewish opposition in jerusalem a civil war broke out between pharisee supported jewish rebels and jannaeus
overall the war lasted six years and left 50000 judeans dead after jannaeus succeeded early in the war the rebels asked for seleucid assistance judean insurgents joined forces with  to fight against jannaeus the seleucid forces defeated jannaeus at  and forced him to take uge in the mountains however these judean rebels ultimately decided that it was better to live under a terrible jewish king than backtrack to a seleucid ruler after 6000 jews returned to jannaeus demetrius was defeated the end of the civil war brought a sense of national solidarity against seleucid influence nevertheless jannaeus was uninterested in reconciliation within the judean state
the aftermath of the judean civil war consisted of popular unrest poverty and grief over the fallen soldiers on both sides the greatest impact of the war was the victors revenge josephus reports that jannaeus brought 800 rebels to jerusalem and had them crucified and had the throats of the rebels wives and children cut before their eyes as jannaeus ate with his concubines
the coinage of alexander jannaeus is characteristic of the early jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations in opposition to the surrounding greek and later roman types of the period jewish coinage instead focused on symbols either natural such as the  the  or the star or man made such as the  the  trumpets or 
alexander jannaeus was the first of the jewish kings to introduce the eight ray star or eight spoked wheel symbol in his  widows mite coins in combination with the widespread  numismatic symbol of the anchor depending on the make the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle in a style rather indicative of a wheel on others the spokes can have a more flame like shape more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem
it is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize and interpretations vary from the morning star to the sun or the heavens the influence of some n symbols of a star within a diadem or the eight spoked  wheel see the coins of the  king  with this symbol have also been suggested the eight spoked macedonian star a variation of which is the  emblem of the royal  and the ancient kingdom of ia within a hellenistic  symbolizing royalty many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem seem to be the most probable source for this symbol
the most likely explanation is that the symbol is a star encased in a diadem and it is a religious explanation biblical law forbids the making of graven images especially see deuteronomy 41623 yet the image of a monarch is a staple of hellenistic coins in place of an image of himself theore it is likely that alexander jannaeus chose a star in keeping with numbers 2417 a star rises from jacob a scepter comes forth from israel this verse generally was seen as a biblical support for monarchy and specifically as support for a davidic monarchy jannaeus however could have seen it as an image of his achievements if not his own rule this is how the rest of numbers 2417 and verses 18 and 19 continue the star it says smashes the brow of moab the foundation of all children of seth edom becomes a possession yea seir a possession of its enemies but israel is triumphant a victor issues from jacob to wipe out what is left of ir considering jannaeus conquests—creating a kingdom that rivaled those of david and solomon and may have even exceeded those—the star envisioned in the prophecy of balaam in numbers was a perfect match for him

the alexandrists were a school of  philosophers who in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality adopted the explanation of the de anima given by 
according to the orthodox  of the   rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul against this the averroists led by  introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again  these two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality or the absorption of the individual into the eternal one
the alexandrists led by  assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to aristotle  they held that aristotle considered the soul as a material and theore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason  hence the alexandrists denied the aristotle viewed the soul as immortal because in their view since they believed that aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former

alexios was the son of the   and  name kazhdan pg 63kazhdan pg 63  and the nephew of  emperor 1057–1059 alexios father declined the throne on the abdication of isaac who was thus succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081 under one of these emperors  1067–1071 alexios served with distinction against the  name norwich pg 4   under  parapinakes 1071–1078 and  1078–1081 he was also employed along with his elder brother  against rebels in   and in 
in 1074 western merchantmen led by  rebelled in asia minor name norwich pg 2norwich pg 2  but alexios successfully subdued them by 1076 name alexiad 11alexiad 11  in 1078 he was appointed commander of the field army in the west by nikephorosampnbspiii name norwich pg 3norwich pg 3  in this capacity alexios defeated the rebellions of  whose son or grandson later married alexios daughter anna and  the first at the  and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp name canduci pg 277canduci pg 277  alexios was ordered to march against his brother in law  in asia minor but used to fight his kinsman this did not however lead to a demotion as alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the  of southern italy led by 
while byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition the doukas faction at court approached alexios and convinced him to join a  against nikephorosampnbspiii the mother of alexios anna dalassena was to play a prominent role in this coup détat of 1081 along with the current empress  name garland anna dalassenagarland anna dalassena  first married to michaelampnbspvii doukas and secondly to  she was preoccupied with the future of her son by michaelampnbspvii  nikephorosampnbspiii intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives name finlay pg 59finlay pg 59  and this resulted in marias ambivalence and alliance with the komnenoi though the real driving force behind this political alliance was anna dalassenealexiad 221–2 
the empress was already closely connected to the komnenoi through marias cousin irene to isaac komnenos name finlay pg 59   so the komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit furthermore to aid the conspiracy maria had adopted alexios as her son though she was only five years older than he name norwich pg 5norwich pg 5  maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own alans and her eunuchs who had been instigated by isaac komnenos given annas tight hold on her family alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval name garland anna dalassena  as a result alexios and constantine marias son were now adoptive brothers and both isaac and alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperoralexiad 214–6 232–3234 cf bryennius 42 who dates the adoption to early in the reign of botaneiates  by secretly giving inside information to the komnenoi maria was an invaluable allyalexiad 234245 
as stated in the alexiad isaac and alexios left constantinople in mid february 1081 to raise an army against botaneiatesnorwich pg 6  however when the time came anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took uge in the  from there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital while protesting her sons innocence of hostile actions under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church she deliberately excluded the grandson of botaneiates and his loyal tutor met with alexios and isaac and fled for the forum of constantine name garland anna dalassena  the tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds but anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from  who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip however before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace name garland anna dalassena  anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives her sons were loyal subjects alexios and isaac were discovered absent without leave and had learned of a plot by enemies of the komnenoi to have them both blinded and had theore fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperoralexiad255  she used to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the mother of god for protection this request was granted and anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities
nikephorosampnbspiii botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family name garland anna dalassena  straboromanos tried to give anna his cross but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath she also demanded that the cross be personally sent by botaneiates as a vow of his good faith he obliged sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross at the emperors further insistence and for their own protection they took uge at the convent of petrion where they were eventually joined by  mother of irene doukaina name garland anna dalassena  botaneiates allowed them to be treated as ugees rather than as guests they were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest newsalexiad 257–9  anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city she distracted the emperor giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops and she gave a false sense of security to botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him name garland anna dalassena  after bribing the western troops guarding the city isaac and alexios komnenos entered the capital victoriously on april 1 1081finlay pg 63 
during this time alexios was rumored to be the lover of empress  the daughter of king  who had been successively married to  doukas and his successor nikephorosampnbspiii botaneiates and who was renowned for her beautynorwich pg 10  alexios arranged for maria to stay on the palace grounds and it was thought that he was considering marrying her however his mother consolidated the doukas family connection by arranging the emperors marriage to  granddaughter of the  the uncle of michaelampnbspvii who would not have supported alexios otherwise as a measure intended to keep the support of the doukai alexios restored  the young son of michaelampnbspvii and maria as co emperornorwich pg 12  and a little later betrothed him to his own first born daughter  who moved into the mangana palace with her fiancé and his mother
this situation changed drastically however when alexios first son  was born in 1087 name kazhdan pg 658kazhdan pg 658  annas engagement to constantine was dissolved and she was moved to the main palace to live with her mother and grandmother alexios became estranged from maria who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery and constantine doukas was deprived of his status as co emperor name kazhdan pg 658   nevertheless he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards
the nearly thirty seven year reign of alexios was full of struggle at the outset he faced the formidable attack of the normans led by  and his son  who took  and  and laid siege to  in  see  name canduci pg 277   alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success he enhanced his resistance by bribing the german king  with 360000 gold pieces to attack the normans in italynorwich pg 21  which forced the normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083–84 he also secured the alliance of  who controlled the  and dated his charters by alexios reign henrys allegiance would be the last example of byzantine political control on peninsular italy the norman danger subsided with the death of guiscard in 1085 and the byzantines recovered most of their lossesnorwich pg 25 
alexios next had to deal with disturbances in  where the heretical sects of the  and the  revolted and made common cause with the  from beyond the finlay pg 101  paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during alexios battles with the normansfinlay pg 78  as soon as the norman threat had passed alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters confiscating their lands this led to a further revolt near  and the commander of the field army in the west gregory pakourianos was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle in 1087 the pechenegs raided into thrace and alexios crossed into  to retaliate but failed to take dorostolon finlay pg 102  during his retreat the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the pechenegs who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money in 1090 the pechenegs invaded thrace againfinlay pg 104  while  the brother in law of the sultan of  launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of constantinople with the pechenegsnorwich pg 26  alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of 40000  with whose help he crushed the pechenegs at  in thrace on 29 april 1091norwich pg 27 
this put an end to the pecheneg threat but in 1094 the cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the balkans led by a pretender claiming to be constantine diogenes a long dead son of the emperor finlay pg 86  the cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern thrace until their leader was eliminated at  with the balkans more or less pacified alexios could now turn his attention to  which had been almost completely overrun by the finlay pg 108 
by the time alexios ascended the throne the seljuqs had taken most of asia minor alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the seljuq camps but these victories were unable to stop the turks altogetherfinlay pg 111  as early as 1090 alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the norwich pg 30  with the intention of seeking western support against the seljuqs in 1095 his ambassadors appeared before  at the  name canduci pg 279canduci pg 279  the help he sought from the west was simply some  forces not the immense hosts that arrived to his consternation and embarrassment after the pope preached the  at the  later that same yearnorwich pg 31  not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories the emperor saw his balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own alliesnorwich pg 33  alexios dealt with the first disorganized group of crusaders led by the preacher  by sending them on to asia minor where they were massacred by the turks in 1096 name kazhdan pg 1479kazhdan pg 1479 
the second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to  led in sections by    and other important members of the western nobilitynorwich pg 36  alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the finlay pg 123  transferring each contingent into asia alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage the crusade was a notable success for byzantium as alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands the  by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in 1097 and the subsequent crusader victory at  allowed the byzantine forces to recover much of western asia minor name norwich pg 42norwich pg 42   re established byzantine rule in      and  in 1097–1099 this success is ascribed by alexios daughter anna to his policy and diplomacy but by the latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception in 1099 a byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing  and other coastal towns as far as  the crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the byzantine contingent under  failed to help them during the  name canduci pg 279   bohemund who had set himself up as  name norwich pg 42   briefly went to war with alexios in the balkans but he was blockaded by the byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of alexios by the  in 1108norwich pg 48

alexios iii angelos was the second son of  and  andronikos was himself a son of  the youngest daughter of emperor  and  thus alexios angelos was a member of the extended imperial family together with his father and brothers alexios had conspired against emperor  c 1183 and thus he spent several years in exile in muslim courts including that of 
his younger brother  was threatened with execution under orders of andronikos i their first cousin once removed on september 11 1185 isaac made a desperate attack on the imperial agents and killed their leader  he then took uge in the church of  and from there appealed to the populace his actions provoked a riot which resulted in the deposition of andronikos i and the proclamation of isaac as emperor alexios was now closer to the imperial throne than ever before
by 1190 alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother from whom he received the elevated title of  in 1195 while isaac ii was away hunting in  alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of alexios wife  alexios captured isaac at  in   and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner despite having previously been redeemed by alexios from captivity at  and showered with honours
to compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the empire practically defenceless these actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state at christmas 1196 holy roman emperor  attempted to force alexios to pay him a tribute of 5000 pounds later negotiated down to 1600 pounds of gold or face invasion alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the holy apostles and  though henrys death in september 1197 meant the gold was never dispatched the able and forceful empress euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court vatatzes the favourite instrument in her attempts at orm was  by the emperors orders
in the east the empire was overrun by the  from the north the  and the rebellious  and  descended unchecked to ravage the balkan provinces of the empire sometimes penetrating as far as greece while alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means the emperors attempts to bolster the empires defences by special concessions to rs notables in the frontier zone backfired as the latter increased their regional autonomy byzantine authority survived but in a much weakened state
soon alexios was threatened by a new and more formidable danger in 1202 soldiers assembled at  to launch the   the son of the deposed isaac ii had recently escaped from  and now appealed for support to the crusaders promising to end the  of  and  to pay for their transport and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his fathers throne

in july the crusaders led by the aged   scaled the walls and took control of a major section of the city in the ensuing fighting the crusaders set the city on fire ultimately leaving 20000 people homeless  on 17 july alexios iii finally took action and led 17 divisions from the  vastly outnumbering the crusaders his courage failed however and the byzantine army returned to the city without a fight his courtiers demanded action and alexios iii promised to fight instead that night july 17 18 alexios iii hid in the palace and finally with one of his daughters eirene and such treasure 1000 pounds of gold as he could collect got into a boat and escaped to  in thrace leaving his wife and his other daughters behind isaac ii drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple received his son alexios iv in state

immediately on his return from finland alexei was dispatched by his father to  and  to see to the building of new ships this was the last commission entrusted to him since peter had not been satisfied with his sons performance and his lack of enthusiasm nevertheless peter made one last effort to reclaim his son on  11 october 1715 charlotte died after giving birth to a son the grand duke peter future tsar  on the day of the funeral peter sent alexei a stern letter urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his fathers plans alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son peter peter would agree but on the condition that alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk
while alexei was pondering his options on 26 august 1716 peter wrote to alexei from abroad urging him if he desired to remain  to join him and the army without delay rather than face this ordeal alexei fled to  and placed himself under the protection of his brother in law the emperor  who sent him for safety first to the ean fortress of ehrenberg near  and finally to the castle of  at  he was accompanied throughout his journey by afrosinia that the emperor sincerely sympathized with alexei and suspected peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son is plain from his confidential letter to  whom he consulted on this delicate affair peter felt insulted the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal and he had to be recovered and brought back to russia at all costs this difficult task was accomplished by count  the most subtle and unscrupulous of peters servants
alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing that if he came back he should not be punished in the least but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry afrosinia
on 31 january 1718 the tsarevich reached moscow peter had already determined to institute a most searching  in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight on 18 february a confession was extorted from alexei which implicated most of his friends and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand duke peter petrovich a brutal reign of terror ensued in the course of which the ex tsaritsa eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged  while all who had in any way befriended alexei were  or  while having their flesh torn with red hot pincers or their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals and were otherwise lingeringly done to death all this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich
in april 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from and in regard to alexei this included the words of afrosinia who had turned states evidence i shall bring back the old people alexei is reported to have told her

when i become sovereign i shall live in moscow and leave saint petersburg simply as any other town i wont launch any ships i shall maintain troops only for defense and wont make war on anyone i shall be content with the old domains in winter i shall live in moscow and in summer in iaroslav blockquote
despite this and other hearsay evidence there were no facts to go upon the worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his fathers death in the eyes of peter his son was now a self convicted and most dangerous traitor whose life was forfeit but there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to russia the whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of s s  and other  on 13 june 1718 the  for their part declared the tsarevich alexei

declaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter the clergy left the matter to the tsars own decision
at noon on 24 june the temporal dignitaries—the 126 members of both the senate and magistrates that comprised the court—declared alexei guilty and sentenced him to death but the examination by torture continued so desperate was peter to uncover any possible collusion
on 19 june the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty five strokes with the  and then on the 24th he was subject to fifteen more on 26 june alexei died in the  in  two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother in law the emperor

by 1824 the democratic republican party had become the only functioning national party its presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal  but this had become unpopular in 1824 most of the democratic republicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary  for president and  for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate  gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the officeadams henry the life of albert gallatin 1879 599 
besides jackson and crawford the secretary of state john quincy adams and house speaker  were also candidates jackson received the most popular votes but not a majority and four states had no popular ballot the  were split four ways with jackson having a plurality because no candidate received a majority the election was decided by the  which chose adams jackson supporters denounced this result as a  because clay gave his states support to adams who subsequently appointed clay as  as none of kentuckys electors had initially voted for adams and jackson had won the popular vote some kentucky politicians criticized clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors jacksons defeat burnished his political credentials however many voters believed the man of the people had been robbed by the corrupt aristocrats of the east
jackson denounced the corrupt bargain that put adams in the white house and laid plans for a crusade to oust adams from office 
after resigning the senate in october 1825 he continued his quest for the presidency the tennessee legislature again nominated jackson for president he attracted vice president   and  into his camp van buren and ritchie were previous supporters of crawford van buren with help from his friends in  and  revived the old republican party gave it a new name as the democratic party restored party rivalries and forged a national organization of durability  the jackson coalition handily defeated adams in 1828

the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press which reached a low point when the press accused jacksons wife rachel of bigamy though the accusation was true as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign it was based on events that occurred many years prior 1791 to 1794 jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife rachel died suddenly on december 22 1828 before his inauguration and was buried on christmas eve he blamed the adams campaigners for her death may god almighty forgive her murderers he swore at her funeral i never can  jackson also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality he was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation workmark cheathem frontiersman or southern gentleman newspaper coverage of andrew jackson during the 1828 presidential campaign the readex report 2014 9#3 http  wwwreadexcom readex report frontiersman or southern gentleman newspaper coverage andrew jackson during 1828cmpid r140903 online
 
jacksons name has been associated with   or the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics   jacksons philosophy as president followed much in the same line as  advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generation   jacksons presidency held a high moralistic tone having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies a limited view of states rights and the federal government  jackson feared that monied and business interests would corrupt  when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession
jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics  instead of choosing party favorites jackson chose plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose  as secretary of state  secretary of war  secretary of treasury  secretary of navy  as attorney general and  as postmaster general  jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip especially between eaton vice president  and van buren  by the spring of 1831 only barry remained while the rest of jacksons cabinet had been discharged jacksons following cabinet selections worked better together
on march 4 1829 andrew jackson became the first united states president elect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitolhttp  memorylocgov ammem pihtml pinotablehtml inaugurals of presidents of the united states some precedents and notable events library of congress  jackson was the first president to invite the public to attend the  ball honoring his first inauguration many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes the crowd became so large that jacksons guards could not keep them out of the white house which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the president the crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the white house lawn to lure people outside jacksons raucous populism earned him the nickname king mob
jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair   vicious washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president s wife  concerning secretary of war  and his wife  salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been quite generous with her favors petticoat politics  emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun used to socialize with the eatons jackson was outraged   male honor he firmly believed required husbands to control their wives allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but for jackson after losing his own wife to horrible rumors peggyss virtue could not be questioned  it was a matter of authority jackson told his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin   jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who questioned and dishonored jackson himselfwhen he defended the honor of peggy eaton jackson was also defending the honor of his recently deceased wife says  
meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian  notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement  the aristocratic wives of european diplomats shrugged the matter off they had their national interest to uphold and had seen how life worked in paris and london secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton daniel walker howe what hath god wrought 2007 pp 337 39 kirsten e wood one woman so dangerous to public morals gender and power in the eaton affair journal of the early republic 1997 237 275 http  wwwjstororg stable 3124447 in jstor 
the upshot was a total revamping of the cabinet with everyone resigning or being fired save the postmaster general jackson nominated van buren to be minister to england calhoun blocked the nomination calhoun continued to serve as vice president and boasted that van burens political career was over stating the defeated nomination would kill him sir kill dead he will never kick sir never kick  van buren however fully recovered and played a leading role in the jacksons unofficial  he became jacksons running mate in 1832 and his successor in 1836 jackson also acquired the globe newspaper to have his own propaganda weapon for fighting the rumor millsmeacham ppampnbsp171–75 
throughout his eight years in office jackson made about 70 treaties with native american tribes both in the  and the  jacksons presidency marked a new era in indian  american relations initiating a policy of indian removal  jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the     and the  the northwest tribes include the   and the  though conflict between indians and american settlers took place in the north and in the south the problem was worse in the south where the indian populations were larger indian wars broke out repeatedly often when native tribes especially the  and  indians used to abide by the treaties for various reasons the  started in december 1835 lasted over six years finally ending in august 1842 under president 
though relations between europeans and later americans and indians were always complicated they grew increasingly complicated once american settlements began pushing further west in the years after the  often these relations were peaceful though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent both on the part of american settlers and the indians from  to john quincy adams the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly though by jacksons time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable the problem was especially acute in the south in particular the lands near the state of  where indian populations were larger denser and more americanized than those of the north as such there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never one known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency this contrasted from his immediate predecessor president  who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention jacksons presidency thus took place in a new era in indian  american relations in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation as such during jacksons presidency indian relations between the southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture
in his december 8 1829 first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the  be set aside for indian tribes congress had been developing its own indian relocation bill and jackson had many supporters in both the senate and house who agreed with his goal on may 26 1830 congress passed the  and jackson signed it into law the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west outside of existing us state borders the passage of the bill was jacksons first successful legislative triumph and marked the democratic partys emergence into american political society the passage of the act was especially popular in the  where population growth and the discovery of gold on  land had increased pressure on tribal lands

in an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments  during jacksons tenure in office large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials jackson who believed appointees should be hired by merit withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies  jackson asked congress to orm embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with  who went on to implement much needed orms in the postal service 
jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the  by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president name firstaddress   in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the  giving the election of president and vice president to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress 
jacksons time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of 1832 for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need  while an act of july 1836 enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions 
upon assuming the presidency in 1829 jackson enforced the  passed earlier into law by president  in 1820 that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates  jackson believed that a  was actually a democratic orm preventing father to son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will  jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed name firstaddress  jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another  jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy opposed to this view however were jacksons supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members in practice this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyaliststhe  as the rotation in office system was called did not originate with jackson it originated with new york governors in the late 18th and early 19th centuries most notably  and   brought it to the  when he replaced federalist office holders after becoming president http  wwwu s historycom pages h965html the spoils system versus the merit system retrieved on november 21 2006  the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes  jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal democratic party followers by granting them federal office appointments jacksons democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me  
jacksons theory regarding rotation of office  generated what would later be called the  a practice that jackson ironically didnt justify  the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations name howe2007  historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics  supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency  during jacksons presidency those in opposition to jacksons purging of office holders formed the  calling jackson king andrew i having feared his military background and named their party after the english parliamentary whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy 
another notable crisis during jacksons period of office was the  or secession crisis of 1828–1832 which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs critics alleged that high tariffs the  on imports of common manufactured goods made in europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern us raising the prices paid by planters in the south southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers
the issue came to a head when vice president calhoun in the  of 1828 supported the claim of his home state  that it had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828 and more generally the right of a state to nullify any federal laws that went against its interests although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men
particularly notable was an incident at the april 13 1830 jefferson day dinner involving after dinner toasts  began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preservedampnbsp– a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dearogg 164 
at the  which was privately engineered by members of the kitchen cabinet calhoun and jackson broke from each other politically and van buren replaced calhoun as jacksons running mate in the  first published in 1860  in december 1832 calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina
in response to south carolinas nullification claim jackson vowed to send troops to  to enforce the laws in december 1832 he issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the  unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitutionampnbsp forms a government not a leagueampnbsp to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nationsyrett 36 see also  
jackson asked congress to pass a  explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until  led by clay agreed to a reduced  the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march 1 1833 and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance the force bill became moot because it was no longer needed on may 1 1833 jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and  and  the real object the next pretext will be the negro or  question 2009  new york random house p 247 correspondence of andrew jackson vol v p 72 
when jackson took office in 1829 spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and  governments  the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state  relations between the us and france were hopeless  jacksons minister to france  however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july 4 1831 that would award the us ₣ 25000000  5000000 in damages name cunningham_1999  the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king  and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies   by 1834 the non payment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in  jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for non payment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france   feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december 1835 state of the union address jackson used to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february 1836 american reparations were finally paid 
in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with   and   jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with     and  under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies   the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased 75% while imports increased 250% 
jackson however was unsuccessful in opening trade with  and   jackson was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for 5000000 failed  jacksons agent in texas colonel anthony butler suggested to take texas over militarily but jackson used butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency

during the  the rechartering of the second national bank became the primary issue  the election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period  the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore in may 1832 nominated jackson of tennessee and  of new york  the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december 1831 nominated  senator from  and former  and  of pennsylvania   the anti mason party who had earlier held their convention also in baltimore in september 1831 nominated  of maryland and amos elmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons  the two rival parties however proved to be no match for jacksons popularity and the democratic partys strong political networks known as hickory clubs in state and local organization   democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity   jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes   wirt received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the anti masonic party folded   jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy 
in 1833 jackson removed federal deposits from the bank whose money lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation  three years later jackson issued the  an  that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was a great demand for specie which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes causing the  which threw the national economy into a deep  it took years for the economy to recover from the damage but the bulk of the damage was blamed on  who took office in 1837w j rorabaugh donald t critchlow paula c baker 2004 https  booksgooglecom booksid vl_6x5zwookcamppg pa210ampdq pa349ampdqamphl en#v onepageampq ampf false americas promise a concise history of the united states rowman amp littlefield p210 isbn 0 7425 1189 8   notes 
the us senate censured jackson on march 28 1834 for his action in removing us funds from the bank of the united states  the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jackson rival senator  which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson name brands  during the proceedings preceding the censure jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel and the issue was highly divisive within the senate however the censure was approved 26–20 on march 28 name brands  when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters led by  who though he had once shot jackson in a street fight eventually became an ardent supporter of the president name brands  
the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson jackson had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the  for  on may 6 1833 jackson sailed on uss cygnet to  where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of  s mother during a stopover near  randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the well known writer  jackson decided not to press charges name paletta 
on january 30 1835 what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the  when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of  representative   an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring name americanheritagecom  lawrence was restrained and legend says that jackson attacked lawrence with his cane others present including  restrained and disarmed lawrence
lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a erence to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically  dead since 1485—and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized
afterwards due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same  that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos
 
during the summer of 1835 controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819–1820  debates northern abolitionists were sending anti slavery tracts through the us postal system into the south  pro slavery southerners objected believing the tracts were incendiary literature and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti slavery tracts into the south on july 29 a pro slavery mob of 300 people led by former governor  broke into the post office in charleston south carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts the jackson administration had southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism however jackson who demanded sectional peace desired to placate southerners at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of northern democrats jacksons postmaster general  gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti slavery tracts jackson angrily denounced northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published jackson who wanted the matter quickly resolved also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers in february 1836 senator  jacksons former vice president authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti slavery tracts via the federal mail service the bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the house many southern postmasters however disregarded matters of federal law and simply used to send the anti slavery tracts
 
in the same year another controversy took place when abolitionists sent the us house of representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in washington dc this infuriated pro slavery southerners who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions on december 18 1835 south carolina congressman  strongly denounced abolitionists as ignorant fanatics northern whigs objected that anti slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden  jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly south carolina representative  drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as sickly sentimentality declared that congress had no right to interfere with slavery and tabled  all further anti slavery petitions jackson leaders in congress supported the measure which was passed quickly and without any debate temporarily suppressing pro abolitionist activities in congress
 
in 1835 pro slavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government by may 1836 they had routed the mexican military for the time being establishing an independent   the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant with recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an anti slavery issue during the 1836 election  the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact while democratic candidate van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a  on the last day of his presidency march 3 1837 
jackson initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office  the last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by  on the  jacksons predecessor  attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828 but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to  and the  jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second  term   on may 18 1836 jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic  jackson put secretary of navy  in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838 under the next president   one  ship  later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may 1836 circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the  confirming the existence of the  continent name usspo

andrew johnson december 29 1808 july 31 1875 was the   serving from 1865 to 1869 johnson became president as he was  at the time of   a democrat who ran with lincoln on the  ticket johnson came to office as the  concluded the new president favored quick restoration of the  to the union his plans did not give protection to the  and he came into conflict with the  dominated congress culminating in  by the house of representatives the first american president to be impeached he was acquitted in the senate by one vote
johnson was born in poverty in  apprenticed as a tailor he worked in several frontier towns before settling in  he served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the  in 1835 after brief service in the  johnson was elected to the federal house of representatives in 1843 where he served five two year terms he became  for four years and was elected by the legislature to the senate in 1857 in his congressional service he sought passage of the  which was enacted soon after he left his senate seat in 1862
as  s including tennessee seceded to form the  johnson remained firmly with the union in 1862 lincoln appointed him as military governor of tennessee after it had been retaken in 1864 johnson as a  and  was a logical choice as  for lincoln who wished to send a message of national unity in his re election campaign their ticket easily won when johnson was sworn in as vice president in march 1865 he gave a rambling speech he later secluded himself to avoid public ridicule six weeks later the assassination of lincoln made him president
johnson implemented his own form of ampnbsp– a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re form their civil governments when southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed  to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties congress used to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the southern actions johnson vetoed their bills and congress overrode him setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidencyjohnson saw 15 of his vetoes overridden by congress   johnson opposed the  which gave citizenship to former slaves as the conflict between the branches of government grew congress passed the  restricting johnsons ability to fire cabinet officials when he persisted in trying to dismiss secretary of war  he was impeached by the house of representatives and narrowly avoided conviction in the senate and removal from office returning to tennessee after his presidency johnson sought political vindication and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the senate again in 1875 the only former president to serve there just months before his death although johnsons ranking has fluctuated over time he is generally considered  american presidents for his opposition to federally guaranteed rights for 
andrew johnson was born in  on december 29 1808 to  1778–1812 and mary polly mcdonough 1783–1856 a laundress his parents were of  and  ancestrypoles in united states by jan drohojowski krajowa agencja wydawnicza 1976 page 114  he had a brother william four years his senior and an older sister elizabeth who died in childhood johnsons having been born in a  was a political asset in the mid 19th century and johnson years later would frequently remind voters of his humble origins jacob johnson was a poor man as had been his father william johnson but he became town constable of raleigh before marrying and starting a family he died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell shortly after rescuing three drowning men when his son andrew was three polly johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family her occupation was then looked down on as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied there were even rumors that andrew who did not resemble his brother or sister had been fathered by another man polly johnson eventually remarried to turner doughtry who was as poor as she was
johnsons mother apprenticed her son william to a tailor james selby andrew also became an apprentice in selbys shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday johnson lived with his mother for part of his service and one of selbys employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills his education was augmented by citizens who would come to selbys shop to read to the tailors as they worked even before he became an apprentice johnson came to listen the readings caused a lifelong love of learning and one of his biographers  suggests that johnson later a gifted public speaker learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth
andrew johnson was not happy at james selbys and after about five years both he and his brother ran away selby responded by placing a reward for their return ten dollars reward ran away from the subscriber two apprentice boys legally bound named william and andrew johnsonampnbsp payment to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in raleigh or i will give the above reward for andrew johnson alone the brothers went to  where andrew johnson worked as a tailor for several months fearing he would be arrested and returned to raleigh johnson moved to  he found work quickly met his first love mary wood and made her a quilt as a gift however she rejected his marriage proposal  he returned to raleigh hoping to buy out his apprenticeship but could not come to terms with selby unable to stay in raleigh where he risked being apprehended for abandoning selby he decided to move west
johnson left north carolina for tennessee traveling mostly on foot after a brief period in  he moved to  he then worked as a tailor in  but was called back to raleigh by his mother and stepfather who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west johnson and his party traveled through the  to  andrew johnson fell in love with the town at first sight and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration
in greeneville johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home in 1827 at the age of 18 he married 16 year old  the daughter of a local shoemaker the pair were married by justice of the peace mordecai lincoln first cousin of  whose son would become president the johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children martha 1828 charles 1830 mary 1832 robert 1834 and andrew jr 1852 though she suffered from  eliza supported her husbands endeavors she taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing shy and retiring by nature eliza johnson usually remained in greeneville during johnsons political rise she was not often seen during her husbands presidency their daughter martha usually served as official hostess
johnsons tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate he later boasted of his talents as a tailor my work never ripped or gave way he was a voracious reader books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views he also took part in debates at 
johnson helped organize a mechanics working mens ticket in the 1829 greeneville municipal election he was elected town alderman along with his friends blackston mcdannel and mordecai lincoln following the 1831  a state convention was called to pass a new constitution including provisions to  free people of color the convention also wanted to orm real estate tax rates and provide ways of funding improvements to tennessees infrastructure the constitution was submitted for a public vote and johnson spoke widely for its adoption the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure on january 4 1834 his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of greeneville
in 1835 johnson made a bid for election to the floater seat which  shared with neighboring  in the  according to his biographer  johnson demolished the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin soon after taking his seat johnson purchased his first slave dolly aged 14 dolly had three children over the years johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly and the fact that dolly was dark skinned and her offspring much lighter led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father during his greeneville days johnson joined the  as a member of the 90th regiment he attained the rank of  though while an enrolled member johnson was fined for an unknown offense afterwards he was often addressed or erred to by his rank
in his first term in the legislature which met in the state capital of nashville johnson did not consistently vote with either the  or the newly formed  though he revered president  a democrat and tennessean the major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals with the party system in a state of flux the whig party had organized in opposition to jackson fearing the concentration of power in the executive branch of the government johnson differed from the whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation after  and the whigs defeated johnson for re election in 1837 johnson would not lose another race for thirty years in 1839 he sought to regain his seat initially as a whig but when another candidate sought the whig nomination he ran as a democrat and was elected from that time he supported the democratic party and built a powerful political machine in greene county johnson became a strong advocate of the democratic party noted for his oratory and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it people flocked to hear him
in 1840 johnson was selected as a presidential elector for tennessee giving him more statewide publicity although democratic president  was defeated by former ohio senator  johnson was instrumental in keeping tennessee and greene county in the democratic column he was elected to the  in 1841 where he served a two year term name congbio  he had achieved financial success in his tailoring business but sold it to concentrate on politics he had also acquired additional real estate including a larger home and a farm where his mother and stepfather took residence and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves
having served in both houses of the legislature johnson saw election to congress as the next step in his political career he engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain democratic support including the displacement of the whig postmaster in greeneville and defeated  lawyer john a aiken by 5495 votes to 4892 in washington he joined a new democratic majority in the house of representatives johnson advocated for the interests of the poor maintained an anti  stance argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs with eliza remaining in greeneville congressman johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the  although a fellow tennessee democrat   in 1844 and johnson had campaigned for him the two men had difficult relations and president polk used some of his patronage suggestions
johnson believed as did many southern democrats that the constitution protected private property including slaves and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery he won a second term in 1845 against  presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy in his second term johnson supported the polk administrations decision to fight the  seen by some northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward and opposed the  a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from mexico he introduced for the first time his homestead bill to grant  to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it this issue was especially important to johnson because of his own humble beginnings
in the  the democrats split over the slavery issue and abolitionists formed the  with former president van buren as their nominee johnson supported the democratic candidate former michigan senator  with the party split whig nominee general  was easily victorious and carried tennessee johnsons relations with polk remained poor the president recorded of his final new years reception in 1849 that
johnson due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district also supported government assistance for the 
in his campaign for a fourth term johnson concentrated on three issues slavery homesteads and judicial elections he defeated his opponent  in august 1849 with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns when the house convened in december the party division caused by the free soil party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a speaker johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a speaker by a plurality some weeks later others took up a similar proposal and democrat  was elected
once the speaker election had concluded and congress was ready to conduct legislative business the issue of slavery took center stage northerners sought to admit california a free state to the union kentuckys  introduced in the senate a series of resolutions the  to admit california and pass legislation sought by each side johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nations capital he pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators then elected by state legislatures and of the president chosen by the  and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years these were all defeated
a group of democrats nominated  to oppose johnson as he sought a fifth term the whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own the campaign included fierce debates johnsons main issue was the passage of the homestead bill haynes contended it would facilitate abolition johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes though he was not enamored of the partys presidential nominee in 1852 former new hampshire senator  johnson campaigned for him pierce was elected but he failed to carry tennessee in 1852 johnson managed to get the house to pass his homestead bill but it failed in the senate the whigs had gained control of the tennessee legislature and under the leadership of  redrew the boundaries of johnsons first district to make it a safe seat for their party the nashville union termed this henry mandering lamented johnson i have no political future
if johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek re election he soon changed his mind the congressmans political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor the democratic convention unanimously named him though some party members were not happy at his selection the whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections and still controlled the legislature that party nominated henry making the henry mandering of the first district an immediate issue the two men debated in county seats the length of tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the august 1853 election due to illness in henrys family johnson won the election by 63413 votes to 61163 some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support whig  for his old seat in congress
tennessees governor had little power—johnson could propose legislation but not veto it and most appointments were made by the whig controlled legislature nevertheless the office was a  that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views he succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of  a whig for one of the states us senate seats in his first biennial speech johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system abolishment of the bank of tennessee and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures the last was passed johnson was critical of the tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes either statewide or county by county—a mixture of the two was passed reforms carried out during johnsons time as governor included the foundation of the states public library making books available to all and its first public school system and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers 
although the whig party was on its final decline nationally it remained strong in tennessee and the outlook for democrats there in 1855 was poor feeling that re election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought johnson agreed to make the run  received the whig nomination a series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued the issues in the campaign were slavery the prohibition of alcohol and the  positions of the  johnson favored the first but opposed the others gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question and had gained the support of the know nothings a group johnson portrayed as a secret society johnson was unexpectedly victorious albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853
when the presidential election of 1856 approached johnson hoped to be nominated some tennessee county conventions designated him a  his position that the best interests of the union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president he was never a major contender the nomination fell to former pennsylvania senator  though he was not impressed by either johnson campaigned for buchanan and his running mate  who were elected
johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor with an eye towards election to the us senate in 1857 while returning from washington his train derailed causing serious damage to his right arm this injury would trouble him in the years to come
 
the victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would once they convened in october elect a united states senator former whig governor  wrote to his uncle the great anxiety of the whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat andrew johnson for senator should the democrats have the majority he will certainly be their choice and there is no man living to whom the americans and whigs have as much antipathy as johnson the governor spoke widely in the campaign and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature johnsons final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors and he made proposals popular among democrats two days later the legislature elected him to the senate the opposition was appalled with the richmond whig newspaper erring to him as the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the union
johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self employed tradesmen who made up much of tennessees electorate he called them the plebians he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state democratic party but none could match him as a vote getter after his death one tennessee voter wrote of him johnson was always the same to everyoneampnbsp the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen always seen in impeccably tailored clothing he cut an impressive figure and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate mostly denied the partys machinery he relied on a network of friends advisers and contacts one friend hugh douglas stated in a letter to him you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time at heart many of us never wanted you to be governor only none of the rest of us could   capitalization as in original    have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you then we did not want you to go to the senate but the people would send you
the new senator took his seat when congress convened in december 1857 the term of his predecessor  had expired in march he came to washington as usual without his wife and family eliza would visit washington only once during johnsons first time as senator in 1860 johnson immediately set about introducing the homestead bill in the senate but as most senators who supported it were northern many associated with the newly founded  the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the homestead bill were more likely to be northern non slaveholders the issue of slavery had been complicated by the supreme courts ruling earlier in the year in  that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories johnson a slaveholding senator from a southern state made a major speech in the senate the following may in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the homestead bill and slavery were not incompatible nevertheless southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation 30–22 in 1859 it failed on a procedural vote when vice president breckinridge broke a tie against the bill and in 1860 a watered down version passed both houses only to be vetoed by buchanan at the urging of southerners johnson continued his opposition to spending chairing a committee to control it
he argued against funding to build washington dcs infrastructure stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the citys streets even if it was the seat of government he opposed spending money for troops to put down  by the mormons in  arguing for temporary volunteers as the united states should not have a standing army
 
in october 1859 abolitionist  and sympathizers  at  virginia today west virginia tensions in washington between pro  and anti slavery forces increased greatly johnson gave a major speech in the senate in december decrying northerners who would endanger the union by seeking to outlaw slavery the tennessee senator stated that all men are created equal from the  did not apply to african americans since the  contained that phrase—and that document barred voting by african americans
johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the democratic party tore itself apart over the slavery question busy with the homestead bill during the  in  he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom dealmaking the convention deadlocked with no candidate able to gain the required two thirds vote but the sides were too far apart to consider johnson as a compromise the party split with northerners backing illinois senator  while southerners including johnson supported vice president breckinridge for president with former tennessee senator  running a fourth party candidacy and further dividing the vote the republican party elected its first president former illinois representative   known to be against the spread of slavery was unacceptable to many in the south although secession from the union had not been an issue in the campaign talk of it began in the southern states
johnson took to the senate floor after the election giving a speech well received in the north i will not give up this governmentampnbsp no   punct as in original    i intend to stand by itampnbsp and i invite every man who is a patriot toampnbsp rally around the altar of our common countryampnbsp and swear by our god and all that is sacred and holy that the constitution shall be saved and the union preserved as southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded he reminded mississippi senator  that if southerners would only hold to their seats the democrats would control the senate and could defend the souths interests against any infringement by lincoln gordon reed points out that while johnsons belief in an indissoluble union was sincere he had alienated southern leaders including davis who would soon be  of the  formed by the seceding states if the tennessean had backed the confederacy he would have had small influence in its government
johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession his successor as governor  and the legislature organized a erendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession when that failed they put the question of leaving the union to a popular vote despite threats on johnsons life and actual assaults he campaigned against both questions sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him although johnsons  was largely against secession the second erendum passed and in june 1861 tennessee joined the confederacy believing he would be killed if he stayed johnson fled through the  where his party was in fact shot at he left his wife and family in greeneville
as the only member from a seceded state to remain in the senate and the most prominent  johnson had lincolns ear in the early months of the war with most of tennessee in confederate hands johnson spent congressional recesses in kentucky and ohio trying in vain to convince any union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into east tennessee
   this section is linked to from    
johnsons first tenure in the senate came to a conclusion in march 1862 when lincoln appointed him military governor of tennessee much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the confederates were defeated in an area lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over union controlled southern regions the senate quickly confirmed johnsons nomination along with the rank of  in response the confederates confiscated his land and his slaves and turned his home into a military hospital later in 1862 after his departure from the senate and in the absence of most southern legislators the  was finally enacted along with legislation for s and for the  the homestead bill has been credited with opening the american west to settlement
as military governor johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state he demanded loyalty oaths from public officials and shut down all newspapers owned by confederate sympathizers much of eastern tennessee remained in confederate hands and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought confederate control again close to nashville however the confederate allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him johnson undertook the defense of nashville as best he could though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by general  relief from union regulars did not come until  defeated the confederates at  in early 1863 much of eastern tennessee was captured later that year
when lincoln issued the  in january 1863 declaring freedom for all slaves in confederate held areas he exempted tennessee at johnsons request the proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war as not all unionists supported abolition johnson finally decided that slavery had to end he wrote if the institution of slaveryampnbsp seeks to overthrow it the government then the government has a clear right to destroy it he reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the union army feeling that african americans should perform menial tasks to release white americans to do the fighting nevertheless he succeeded in recruiting 20000 black soldiers to serve the union
in 1860 lincolns running mate had been maine senator  vice president hamlin had served competently was in good health and was willing to run nevertheless johnson emerged as running mate for lincolns re election bid in 1864
lincoln considered several  for the ticket in 1864 and sent an agent to sound out general  as a possible running mate in may 1864 the president dispatched general  to nashville on a fact finding mission although sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor johnson biographer hans l tousse believes sickless trip was connected to johnsons subsequent nomination for vice president according to historian albert castel in his account of johnsons presidency lincoln was impressed by johnsons administration of tennessee gordon reed points out that while the lincoln hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860 having johnson the southern war democrat on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country another factor was the desire of secretary of state  to frustrate the vice presidential candidacy of his fellow new yorker former senator  a war democrat as seward would probably have had to yield his place if another new yorker became vice president johnson once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of sickles visit was active on his own behalf giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy
to sound a theme of unity lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the  rather than the republicans at  in baltimore in june lincoln was easily nominated although there had been some talk of replacing him with a cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals after the convention backed lincoln former secretary of war  offered a resolution to nominate hamlin but it was defeated johnson was nominated for vice president by cm allen of indiana with an iowa delegate as seconder on the first ballot johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for hamlin and 108 for dickinson on the second ballot kentucky switched to vote for johnson beginning a stampede johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to hamlins 17 and eight for dickinson the nomination was made unanimous lincoln expressed pleasure at the result andy johnson i think is a good man when word reached nashville a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the union
although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign johnson gave a number of speeches in tennessee kentucky ohio and indiana he also sought to boost his chances in tennessee while re establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the confederacy the democratic candidate for president  hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters lincoln declined to override johnson and their ticket took the state by 25000 votes congress used to count tennessees electoral votes but lincoln and johnson did not need them having won in most states that had voted and easily secured the election
now vice president elect johnson was anxious to complete the work of re establishing civilian government in tennessee although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after inauguration day march 4 he hoped to remain in nashville to complete his task but was told by lincolns advisers that he could not stay but would be sworn in with lincoln in these months union troops finished the retaking of eastern tennessee including greeneville just before his departure the voters of tennessee ratified a new constitution abolishing slavery on february 22 1865 one of johnsons final acts as military governor was to certify the results
johnson traveled to washington to be sworn in although according to gordon reed in light of what happened on march 4 1865 it might have been better if johnson had stayed in nashville he may have been ill castel cited typhoid fever though gordon reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis on the evening of march 3 johnson attended a party in his honor he drank heavily hung over the following morning at the capitol he asked vice president hamlin for some whiskey hamlin produced a bottle and johnson took two stiff drinks stating i need all the strength for the occasion i can have in the senate chamber johnson delivered a rambling address as lincoln the congress and dignitaries looked on almost incoherent at times he finally meandered to a halt whereupon hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president lincoln who had watched sadly during the debacle was sworn in and delivered his acclaimed 
in the weeks after the inauguration johnson only presided over the senate briefly and hid from public ridicule at the maryland home of a friend  when he did return to washington it was with the intent of leaving for tennessee to re establish his family in greeneville instead he remained after word came that general  had captured the confederate capital of  presaging the end of the war lincoln stated in response to criticism of johnsons behavior that i have known andy johnson for many years he made a bad slip the other day but you need not be scared andy aint a drunkard
on the afternoon of april 14 1865 lincoln and johnson met for the first time since the inauguration tousse states that johnson wanted to induce lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors gordon reed agrees
that night president lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by  a confederate sympathizer the shooting of the president was part of a conspiracy to assassinate lincoln johnson and seward the same night seward barely survived his wounds while johnson escaped attack as his would be assassin  got drunk instead of killing the vice president  a fellow boarder at the kirkwood house awoke johnson with news of lincolns shooting at  johnson rushed to the presidents deathbed where he remained a short time on his return promising they shall suffer for this they shall suffer for this lincoln died at 722ampnbspam the next morning johnsons swearing in occurred between 10 and 11ampnbspam with chief justice  presiding in the presence of most of the cabinet johnsons demeanor was described by the newspapers as solemn and dignified some cabinet members had last seen johnson apparently drunk at the inauguration at noon johnson conducted his first cabinet meeting in the treasury secretarys office and asked all members to remain in their positions
the events of the assassination resulted in speculation then and subsequently concerning johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him in the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of johnson was merely a ruse conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination booth came to the kirkwood house and left one of his cards this object was received by johnsons private secretary william a browning with an inscription are you at home dont wish to disturb you j wilkes booth
johnson presided with dignity over lincolns funeral ceremonies in washington before his predecessors body was sent home to  for burial shortly after lincolns death union general  reported he had without consulting washington reached an armistice agreement with confederate general  for the surrender of confederate forces in north carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power with private property rights to be respected this did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery this was not acceptable to johnson or the cabinet who sent word for sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals which he did further johnson placed a 100000 bounty equivalent to  million in  on confederate president davis then a fugitive which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the south more controversially he permitted the execution of  for her part in lincolns assassination surratt was executed with three others including atzerodt on july 7 1865
 
upon taking office johnson faced the question of what to do with the confederacy president lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in virginia arkansas louisiana and tennessee as the union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a  that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the union congress considered this too lenient  requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath passed both houses in 1864 but lincoln ed it
johnson had three goals in reconstruction he sought a speedy restoration of the states on the grounds that they had never truly left the union and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government to johnson african american suffrage was a delay and a distraction it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote second political power in the southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved plebians johnson feared that the freedmen many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters might vote at their direction johnsons third priority was election in his own right in 1868 a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish
the republicans had formed a number of factions the s sought voting and other civil rights for african americans they believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote republican in gratitude for emancipation and that black votes could keep the republicans in power and southern democrats including former rebels out of influence they believed that top confederates should be punished the moderate republicans sought to keep the democrats out of power at a national level and prevent former rebels from resuming power they were not as enthusiastic about the idea of african american suffrage as their radical colleagues either because of their own local political concerns or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly northern democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the southern states they did not support african american suffrage which might threaten democratic control in the south
 
johnson was initially left to devise a reconstruction policy without legislative intervention as congress was not due to meet again until december 1865 radical republicans told the president that the southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the union but johnson with the support of other officials including seward insisted that the franchise was a state not a federal matter the cabinet was divided on the issue
johnsons first reconstruction actions were two proclamations with the unanimous backing of his cabinet on may 29 one recognized the virginia government led by provisional governor  the second provided amnesty for all ex rebels except those holding property valued at 20000 or more it also appointed a temporary governor for north carolina and authorized elections neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding  or freedmens rights the president ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states
as southern states began the process of forming governments johnsons policies received considerable public support in the north which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the south while he received such support from the white south he underestimated the determination of northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing it was important in northern public opinion that the south acknowledge its defeat that slavery be ended and that the lot of african americans be improved voting rights were less important—after all only a handful of northern states mostly in new england gave african american men the right to vote on the same basis as whites and in late 1865 connecticut wisconsin and minnesota voted down african american suffrage proposals by large margins northern public opinion tolerated johnsons inaction on black suffrage as an experiment to be allowed if it quickened southern acceptance of defeat instead white southerners felt emboldened a number of southern states passed  binding african american laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor most southerners elected to congress were former confederates with the most prominent being georgia senator designate and former confederate vice president  congress assembled in early december 1865 johnsons conciliatory  to them was well received nevertheless congress used to seat the southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate reconstruction legislation
northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant confederate leaders such as stephens rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw they saw the black codes placing african americans in a position barely above slavery republicans also feared that restoration of the southern states would return the democrats to power in addition according to  in his book on johnsons impeachment the violence and poverty that oppressed the south would galvanize the opposition to johnson
 
congress was reluctant to confront the president and initially only sought to fine tune johnsons policies towards the south according to tousse if there was a time when johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the republican party it was the period following the return of congress the president was unhappy about the provocative actions of the southern states and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there but made no statement publicly believing that southerners had a right to act as they did even if it was unwise to do so by late january 1866 he was convinced that winning a showdown with the radical republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of reconstruction and for re election in 1868 he would have perred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise african americans in the district of columbia a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all white erendum a bill to accomplish this passed the house of representatives but to johnsons disappointment stalled in the senate before he could veto it
illinois senator  leader of the moderate republicans and chairman of the judiciary committee was anxious to reach an understanding with the president he ushered through congress a bill extending the  beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867 and the first civil rights bill to grant citizenship to the freedmen trumbull met several times with johnson and was convinced the president would sign the measures johnson rarely contradicted visitors often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord in fact the president opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty additionally both of trumbulls bills were unpopular among white southerners whom johnson hoped to include in his new party johnson vetoed the freedmans bureau bill on february 18 1866 to the delight of white southerners and the puzzled anger of republican legislators he considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the senate the following day johnson believed that the radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate republicans would form behind him he did not understand that moderates too wanted to see african americans treated fairly
on february 22 1866  johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the  and called for an address in honor of  in his hour long speech he instead erred to himself over 200 times more damagingly he also spoke of menampnbsp still opposed to the union to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the south when called upon by the crowd to say who they were johnson named pennsylvania congressman  massachusetts senator  and abolitionist  and accused them of plotting his assassination republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war while one democratic ally estimated johnsons speech cost the party 200000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections
although strongly urged by moderates to sign the  johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on march 27 in his veto message he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the congress and that it discriminated in favor of african americans and against whites within three weeks congress had overridden his veto the first time that had been done on a major bill in american history the veto of the  often seen as a key mistake of johnsons presidency convinced moderates there was no hope of working with him historian  in his volume on reconstruction views it as the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career according to stewart the veto was for many his defining blunder setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency
congress also proposed the  to the states written by trumbull and others it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part though johnson opposed it the amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the civil rights act into the constitution but also went further the amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the united states except indians on reservations penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen and most importantly created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts it also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of confederate war debts further it disqualified many former confederates from office although the disability could be removed—by congress not the president both houses passed the freedmens bureau act a second time and again the president vetoed it this time the veto was overridden by the summer of 1866 when congress finally adjourned johnsons method of restoring states to the union by executive fiat without safeguards for the freedmen was in deep trouble his home state of tennessee ratified the fourteenth amendment despite the presidents opposition when tennessee did so congress immediately seated its proposed delegation embarrassing johnson
efforts to compromise failed and a political war ensued between the united republicans on one side and on the other johnson and his allies in the democratic party north and south he called a convention of the national union party republicans had returned to using their previous identifier johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term in 1868 the battleground was the  southern states were not allowed to vote johnson campaigned vigorously undertaking a public speaking tour known as the  the trip including speeches in chicago st louis indianapolis and columbus proved politically disastrous with the president making controversial comparisons between himself and christ and engaging in arguments with hecklers these exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency the republicans won by a landslide increasing their two thirds majority in congress and made plans to control reconstruction johnson blamed the democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the national union movement
 
even with the republican victory in november 1866 johnson considered himself in a strong position the fourteenth amendment had been ratified by none of the southern or  except tennessee and had been rejected in kentucky delaware and maryland as the amendment required ratification by three quarters of the states to become part of the constitution he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor leading to his election in 1868 once it reconvened in december 1866 an energized congress began passing legislation often over a presidential veto this included the district of columbia voting bill congress admitted nebraska to the union over a veto and the republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment johnsons veto of a bill for statehood for  was sustained enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day
in january 1867 congressman stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts under  the states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions african americans could vote for or become delegates former confederates could not in the legislative process congress added to the bill that restoration to the union would follow the states ratification of the fourteenth amendment and completion of the process of adding it to the constitution johnson and the southerners attempted a compromise whereby the south would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former confederates and for limited black suffrage the republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment and the deal fell through although johnson could have pocket vetoed the  as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the thirty ninth congress he chose to veto it directly on march 2 1867 congress overruled him the same day also on march 2 congress passed the  over the presidents veto in response to statements during the swing around the circle that he planned to fire cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him this bill requiring senate approval for the firing of cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards was immediately controversial with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to johnson whose key cabinet officers were lincoln holdovers
secretary of war  was an able and hard working man but difficult to deal with johnson both admired and was exasperated by his war secretary who in combination with  grant worked to undermine the presidents southern policy from within his own administration johnson considered firing stanton but respected him for his wartime service as secretary stanton for his part feared allowing johnson to appoint his successor and used to resign despite his public disagreements with his president
the new congress met for a few weeks in march 1867 then adjourned leaving the house committee on the judiciary behind charged with reporting back to the full house whether there were grounds for johnson to be impeached this committee duly met examining the presidents bank accounts and summoning members of the cabinet to testify when a federal court released former confederate president davis on bail on may 13 he had been captured shortly after the war the committee investigated whether the president had impeded the prosecution it learned that johnson was eager to have davis tried a bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges the committee adjourned on june 3
later in june johnson and stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the south could override the civil authorities the president had attorney general  issue an opinion backing his position that they could not johnson sought to pin down stanton either as for and thus endorsing johnsons position or against showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the cabinet stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications when congress reconvened in july it passed a reconstruction act against johnsons position waited for his veto overruled it and went home in addition to clarifying the powers of the generals the legislation also deprived the president of control over the army in the south with congress in recess until november johnson decided to fire stanton and relieve one of the military commanders general  who had dismissed the governor of texas and installed a replacement with little popular support he was initially deterred by a strong objection from grant on august 5 the president demanded stantons resignation the secretary used to quit with congress out of session johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of congress as permitted under the tenure of office act grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the army
grant under protest followed johnsons order transferring sheridan and another of the district commanders  who had angered johnson by firmly following congresss plan the president also issued a proclamation pardoning most confederates exempting those who held office under the confederacy or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths although republicans expressed anger with his actions the 1867 elections generally went democratic no seats in congress were directly elected in the polling but the democrats took control of the  allowing them to defeat for re election one of johnsons strongest opponents senator  voters in ohio connecticut and minnesota turned down propositions to grant african americans the vote the adverse results momentarily put a stop to republican calls to impeach johnson who was elated by the elections nevertheless once congress met in november the judiciary committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against johnson after much debate about whether anything the president had done was a high crime or misdemeanor the standard under the constitution the resolution was defeated by the house of representatives on december 7 1867 by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed
johnson notified congress of stantons suspension and grants interim appointment in january 1868 the senate disapproved of his action and reinstated stanton contending the president had violated the tenure of office act grant stepped aside over johnsons objection causing a complete break between them johnson then dismissed stanton and appointed  to replace him stanton used to leave his office and on february 24 1868 the house impeached the president for intentionally violating the tenure of office act by a vote of 128 to 47 the house subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment for the most part alleging that he had violated the tenure of office act and had questioned the legitimacy of congress
on march 5 1868 the impeachment trial began in the senate and lasted almost three months congressmen  benjamin butler and thaddeus stevens acted as managers for the house or prosecutors and   and former attorney general stanbery were johnsons counsel chief justice chase served as presiding judge the defense relied on the provision of the tenure of office act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration since lincoln had appointed stanton the defense maintained johnson had not violated the act and also argued that the president had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of congress johnsons counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial nor publicly comment about the proceedings and except for a pair of interviews in april he complied
johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal for example he pledged to iowa senator  that he would not interfere with congresss reconstruction efforts grimes reported to a group of moderates many of whom voted for acquittal that he believed the president would keep his word johnson also promised to install the respected  as war secretary  kansas senator  received assurances that the new radical influenced constitutions ratified in south carolina and arkansas would be transmitted to the congress without delay an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal one reason senators were reluctant to remove the president was that his successor would have been ohio senator wade the  of the senate wade a  who left office in early 1869 was a radical who supported such measures as womens suffrage placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation additionally a president wade was seen as an obstacle to grants ambitions
with the dealmaking johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict and in the days leading up to the ballot newspapers reported that stevens and his radicals had given up on may 16 the senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment accusing johnson of firing stanton in violation of the tenure of office of act once the senate had overturned his suspension thirty five senators voted guilty and 19 not guilty thus falling short by a single vote of the two thirds majority required for conviction under the constitution seven republicans—senators grimes ross trumbull    and —voted to acquit the president with stevens bitterly disappointed at the result the senate then adjourned for the  grant was nominated for president the senate returned on may 26 and voted on the second and third articles with identical 35–19 results faced with those results johnsons opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings stanton relinquished his office on may 26 and the senate subsequently confirmed schofield when johnson renominated stanbery to return to his position as attorney general after his service as a defense manager the senate used to confirm him
allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial even when it was in progress representative butler began an investigation held contentious hearings and issued a report unendorsed by any other congressman butler focused on a new york–based astor house group supposedly led by  and editor  this organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through cincinnati lawyer charles woolley to bribe senators to acquit johnson butler went so far as to imprison woolley in the capitol building    a committee room and then an artists studio    when he used to answer questions but failed to prove bribery
soon after taking office as president johnson reached an accord with secretary of state  that there would be no change in foreign policy in practice this meant that seward would continue to run things as he had under lincoln seward and lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860 the victor hoped that seward would succeed him as president in 1869 at the time of johnsons accession  sending troops there while many politicians had indulged in  over the mexican matter seward perred quiet diplomacy warning the french through diplomatic channels that their presence in mexico was not acceptable although the president perred a more aggressive approach seward persuaded him to follow his lead in april 1866 the french government informed seward that its troops would be brought home in stages to conclude by november 1867
seward was an expansionist and sought opportunities to gain territory for the united states by 1867 the russian government saw its  today alaska as a financial liability and feared losing control as american settlement reached there it instructed its minister in washington baron  to negotiate a sale de stoeckl did so deftly getting seward to raise his offer from 5 million coincidentally the minimum that russia had instructed de stoeckl to accept to 7 million and then getting 200000 added by raising various objections this sum of 72 million is equivalent to  in present day terms on march 30 1867 de stoeckl and seward signed the treaty working quickly as the senate was about to adjourn johnson and seward took the signed document to the presidents room in the capitol only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment the president summoned the senate into session to meet on april 1 that body approved the treaty 37–2 emboldened by his success in alaska seward sought acquisitions elsewhere his only success was staking an american claim to uninhabited  in the pacific which would be officially claimed by the us  he came close with the  as denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite but the senate never voted on the treaty and it expired 
another treaty that fared badly was the johnson clarendon convention negotiated in settlement of the  for damages to american shipping from british built confederate raiders negotiated by the  former maryland senator  in late 1868 it was ignored by the senate during the remainder of the presidents term the treaty was rejected after he left office and the grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from britain
 
johnson appointed nine article iii federal judges during his presidency all to s he did not appoint a justice to serve on the  in april 1866 he nominated  to fill the vacancy left with the death of  but congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office johnson appointed his greeneville crony  to the  where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874
johnson sought nomination by the  in new york in july 1868 he remained very popular among southern whites and boosted that popularity by issuing just before the convention a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any confederate not already indicted meaning that only davis and a few others still might face trial on the first ballot johnson was second to former ohio representative  who had been his democratic opponent for vice president in 1864 johnsons support was mostly from the south and fell away as the ballots passed on the 22nd ballot former new york governor  was nominated and the president received only four votes all from tennessee
the conflict with congress continued johnson sent congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six year term and make the president and the senate directly elected and for term limits for judges congress took no action on them when the president was slow to officially report ratifications of the fourteenth amendment by the new southern legislatures congress passed a bill again over his veto requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt he still delayed as much as he could but was required in july 1868 to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the constitution
seymours operatives sought johnsons support but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign it was not until october with the vote already having taken place in some states that he mentioned seymour at all and he never endorsed him nevertheless johnson regretted grants victory in part because of their animus from the stanton affair in his annual message to congress in december johnson urged the repeal of the tenure of office act and told legislators that had they admitted their southern colleagues in 1865 all would have been well he celebrated his 60th birthday in late december with a party for several hundred children though not including those of  grant who did not allow his to go
on christmas day 1868 johnson issued a final amnesty this one covering everyone including davis he also issued in his final months in office pardons for crimes including one for dr  controversially convicted of involvement in the lincoln assassination he had set booths broken leg and imprisoned in  on floridas 
on march 3 the president hosted a large public reception at the white house on his final full day in office grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as johnson as was customary and johnson used to go to the inauguration at all despite an effort by seward to prompt a change of mind he spent the morning of march 4 finishing last minute business and then shortly after noon rode from the white house to the home of a friend
after leaving the presidency johnson remained for some weeks in washington then returned to greeneville for the first time in eight years he was honored with large public celebrations along the way especially in tennessee where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners he had arranged to purchase a large farm near greeneville to live on after his presidency
some expected johnson to seek to be tennessees governor again or to attempt a return to the senate others that he would become a railroad executive johnson found greeneville boring and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son robert in 1869 seeking vindication for himself and revenge against his political enemies he launched a senate bid soon after returning home tennessee had gone republican but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the  kept down the african american vote leading to a democratic victory in the legislative elections in august 1869 johnson was seen as a likely victor in the senate election although hated by radical republicans and also by some democrats because of his wartime activities although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislatures balloting the republicans eventually elected  over johnson 54–51 in 1872 there was a special election for an  johnson initially sought the democratic nomination but when he saw that it would go to former confederate general  decided to run as an independent the former president was defeated finishing third but the split in the democratic party defeated cheatham in favor of an old johnson unionist ally 
in 1873 johnson contracted  during an epidemic but recovered that year he lost about 73000 when the first national bank of washington went under though he was eventually repaid much of the sum he began looking towards the next senate election to take place in the legislature in early 1875 johnson began to woo the farmers  with his  he easily gained their support he spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour few african americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as reconstruction faded in tennessee setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other southern states the white domination would last almost a century in the tennessee legislative elections in august the democrats elected 92 legislators to the republicans eight and johnson went to nashville for the legislative session when the balloting for the senate seat began on january 20 1875 he led with 30 votes but did not have the required majority as three former confederate generals one former colonel and a former democratic congressman split the vote with him johnsons opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him but failed and he was elected on january 26 on the 54th ballot with a margin of a single vote nashville erupted in rejoicing remarked johnson thank god for the vindication
johnsons comeback garnered national attention with the st louis republican calling it the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of american politics can show at his swearing in in the senate on march 5 1875 he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president hamlin by that offices current incumbent  who as senator had voted for his ousting many republicans ignored senator johnson though some such as ohios  who had voted for conviction shook his hand johnson remains the only former president to serve in the senate he spoke only once in the short session on march 22 lambasting president grant for his use of federal troops in support of louisianas reconstruction government the former president asked how far off is military despotism and concluded his speech may god bless this people and god save the constitution
johnson returned home after the special session concluded in late july convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the ohio gubernatorial race he decided to travel there to give speeches he began the trip on july 28 and broke the journey at his daughter marys farm near  where his daughter martha was also staying that evening he suffered a stroke but used medical treatment until the next day when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from elizabethton he seemed to respond to their ministrations but suffered another stroke on the evening of july 30 and died early the following morning at the age of 66 president grant had the painful duty of announcing the death of the only surviving past president northern newspapers in their obituaries tended to focus on johnsons loyalty during the war while southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president johnsons funeral was held on august 3 in greeneville he was buried with his body wrapped in an american flag and a copy of the us constitution placed under his head according to his wishes the burial ground was dedicated as the  in 1906 and with his home and tailors shop is part of the 
according to castel historians of johnsons presidency have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event reconstruction through the remainder of the 19th century there were few historical evaluations of johnson and his presidency memoirs from northerners who had dealt with him such as former vice president henry wilson and maine senator  depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the south in reconstruction but who was frustrated by congress according to historian  in his journal article about the historiography of reconstruction men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth thus alabama congressman and historian  and his corroborators presented a southern indictment of northern policies and henry wilsons history was a brief for the north
the turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of johnson leading the wave was pulitzer prize winning historian  who wrote of the former president
rhodes ascribed johnsons faults to his personal weaknesses and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum south other early 20th century historians such as   who later became president himself and  all southerners concurred with rhodes believing johnson flawed and politically inept but concluding that he had tried to carry out lincolns plans for the south in good faith author and journalist jay tolson suggests that wilson depicted reconstruction as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists the so called carpetbaggers and cynical white southerners or scalawags who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain
even as rhodes and his school wrote  was setting out on the full rehabilitation of johnson using for the first time primary sources such as his papers provided by his daughter martha before her death in 1901 and the diaries of johnsons navy secretary  first published in 1911 the resulting volumes such as david miller dewitts the impeachment and trial of president andrew johnson 1903 presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him in james schoulers 1913 history of the reconstruction period the author accused rhodes of being quite unfair to johnson though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves these works had an effect although historians continued to view johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency they saw his reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct a series of highly favorable biographies in the late 1920s and early 1930s that glorified johnson and condemned his enemies accelerated this trend   quote is from castel   
beale wondered in 1940 is it not time that we studied the history of reconstruction without first assuming at least subconsciously that carpetbaggers and southern white republicans were wicked that negroes were illiterate incompetents and that the whole white south owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of white supremacy despite these doubts the favorable view of johnson survived for a time in 1942  portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the hollywood film  in 1948 a poll of his colleagues by historian  deemed johnson among the average presidents in 1956 one by clinton l rossiter named him as one of the near great chief executives foner notes that at the time of these surveys the reconstruction era that followed the civil war was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote
earlier historians including beale believed that money drives events and had seen reconstruction as an economic struggle they also accepted for the most part that reconciliation between north and south should have been the top priority of reconstruction in the 1950s historians began to focus on the african american as central to reconstruction they rejected completely any claim of black inferiority which had marked many earlier historical works and saw the developing  as a second reconstruction  they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights these authors sympathized with the radical republicans for their desire to help the african american and saw johnson as callous towards the freedman in a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as  the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedmans lot these volumes included major biographies of stevens and stanton reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society
in the early 21st century johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in us history according to historian glenn w lafantasie who believes buchanan the worst president johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachmentampnbsp his complete mishandling of reconstruction policyampnbsp his bristling personality and his enormous sense of self importance tolson suggests that johnson is now scorned for having resisted radical republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well being of the newly emancipated african americans gordon reed notes that johnson along with his contemporaries pierce and buchanan are generally listed among the five worst presidents but states there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation the problems these men had to confront were enormous it would have taken a succession of lincolns to do them justice
tousse considers johnsons legacy to be the maintenance of white supremacy his boost to southern conservatives by undermining reconstruction was his legacy to the nation one that would trouble the country for generations to come gordon reed states of johnson

on 7 april 1940 while at the university solzhenitsyn married natalia alekseevna reshetovskaya  they had just over a year of married life before he went into the army then to the gulag they divorced in 1952 a year before his release because wives of gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits after the end of his internal exile they remarried in 1957 p 366  divorcing a second time in 1972

solzhenitsyns adopted son dmitri turin died on march 18 1994 age 32 in cavendish vermont shortly before he could return with his father to russia
after  in 1956 solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and  following his return from exile solzhenitsyn was while teaching at a secondary school during the day spending his nights secretly engaged in writing in his nobel prize acceptance speech he wrote that during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared this would become known 
in 1960 aged 42 he approached  a poet and the chief editor of the novyi mir magazine with the manuscript of  it was published in edited form in 1962 with the explicit approval of  who defended it at the presidium of the politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication and added theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil  the book quickly sold out and became an instant hit in the 1960s while he was publicly known to be writing cancer ward he was simultaneously writing the gulag archipelago during khrushchevs tenure one day in the life of ivan denisovich was studied in schools in the soviet union as were three more short works of solzhenitsyns including his acclaimed short story matryonas home published in 1963 these would be the last of his works published in the soviet union until 1990
one day in the life of ivan denisovich brought the soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the west  it caused as much of a sensation in the soviet union as it did in the west—not only by its striking realism and candor but also because it was the first major piece of soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme written by a non party member indeed a man who had been to siberia for libelous speech about the leaders and yet its publication had been officially permitted in this sense the publication of solzhenitsyns story was an almost unheard of instance of free unrestrained discussion of politics through literature most soviet readers realized this but after khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964 the time for such raw exposing works came to an end
solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt with the help of tvardovsky to get his novel cancer ward legally published in the soviet union this had to get the approval of the  though some there appreciated it the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti soviet insinuations 
after krushchevs removal in 1964 the cultural climate again became more repressive publishing of solzhenitsyns work quickly stopped as a writer he became a  and by 1965 the  had seized some of his papers including the manuscript of the first circle meanwhile solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings the gulag archipelago  the seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an officially acclaimed writer something which had come close to second nature but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant
after the kgb had confiscated solzhenitsyns materials in moscow during 1965–67 the preparatory drafts of  were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends homes in  aleksandr solzhenitsyn had befriended  a lawyer and former estonian minister of education in a  prison cell after completion solzhenitsyns original handwritten script was kept hidden from the kgb in estonia by arnold susis daughter heli susi until the collapse of the soviet union  
in 1969 solzhenitsyn was expelled from the union of writers in 1970 he was awarded the  he could not receive the prize personally in  at that time since he was afraid he would not be let back into the soviet union instead it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the swedish embassy in moscow  the swedish government used to accept this solution however since such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the soviet union and damage swedish soviet relations instead solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the soviet union
the gulag archipelago was composed during 1958–67  this work was a three volume seven part work on the soviet prison camp system solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at any one time the gulag archipelago has sold over thirty million copies in thirty five languages it was based upon solzhenitsyns own experience as well as the testimony of 256  former prisoners and solzhenitsyns own research into the history of the penal system  it discussed the systems origins from the founding of the communist regime with  having responsibility detailing interrogation procedures prisoner transports prison camp culture  and the practice of 
according to fellow gulag historian  the gulag archipelagos rich and varied authorial voice its unique weaving together of personal testimony philosophical analysis and historical investigation and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made the gulag archipelago one of the most impactful books of the 20th century 
the gulag archipelago was met with extensive criticism by party controlled soviet press even though the book was not published in the ussr an editorial in  on 14 january 1974 accused solzhenitsyn of supporting hitlerites and making excuses for the crimes of the  and  gangs according to the editorial solzhenitsyn was choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up for the socialist system and for soviet people 
during this period he was sheltered by the cellist  who suffered considerably for his support of solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself
in august 1971 the kgb allegedly made an attempt to assassinate solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent most likely  with an experimental gel based delivery method the attempt left him seriously ill but ultimately was not successful  
on 12 february 1974 solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the soviet union to  west germany and stripped of his soviet citizenship name nyt20080804  the kgb had found the manuscript for the first part of the gulag archipelago and less than a week later  suffered reprisals for his support of solzhenitsyn us military attaché  managed to smuggle out a large portion of solzhenitsyns archive including the authors membership card for the  and second world war military citations solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to odoms role in his memoir invisible allies 1995

despite spending almost two decades in the united states solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken english he had however been reading english language literature since his teens encouraged by his mother more importantly he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television solzhenitsyns warnings about the dangers of communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the west were generally well received in western conservative circles eg ford administration staffers  and  advocated on solzhenitsyns behalf for him to speak directly to then president  about the soviet threat  prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by us president  at the same time liberals and  became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his  perence for  and the  religion
solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant  of the modern west including television and much of popular music the human soul longs for things higher warmer and purer than those offered by todays mass living habits by tv stupor and by intolerable music despite his criticism of the weakness of the west solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies in a major speech delivered to the international academy of philosophy in liechtenstein on 14 september 1993 solzhenitsyn implored the west not to lose sight of its own values its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen p 599 
in a series of writings speeches and interviews after his return to his native russia in 1994 solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self government he had witnessed first hand in switzerland and new england during his western exilerussia in collapse in  pp 480–1 the cavendish farewell in  pp 606–7  he praised the sensible and sure process of  in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities   solzhenitsyns patriotism was inward looking he called for russia to renounce all mad fantasies of foreign conquest and begin the peaceful long long long period of recuperation as he put it in a 1979 bbc interview with janis sapiets

the kgb sponsored a series of hostile books about solzhenitsyn most notably a memoir published under the name of his first wife natalia reshetovskaya but probably mostly composed by service according to historian  name  andrew   andropov also gave an order to create an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between pauk and the people around him by feeding him rumors that everyone in his surrounding was a kgb agent and deceiving him in all possible ways  among other things the writer constantly received envelopes with photographs of car accidents brain surgery and other frightening illustrations after the kgb harassment in zürich solzhenitsyn settled in  vermont reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a  fence  his influence and  for the west diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of western individualism kgb and  experts finally concluded that he alienated american listeners by his reactionary views and intransigent criticism of the us way of life so no further  would be required name   andrew  
in his book  solzhenitsyn states that he was recruited to report to the nkvd on fellow inmates and was given a code name vetrov but due to his transfer to another camp he was able to elude this duty and never produced a single report name potemschiki 
in 1976 after solzhenitsyn was expelled from the  a report signed by vetrov surfaced after a copy of the report was obtained by solzhenitsyn he published it together with a utation in the  published 24 may 1976 name potemschiki  in 1978 the same report was published by journalist  in a socialist  magazine   however according to solzhenitsyn the report is a fabrication by the  he claimed that the report is dated 20 january 1952 while all ukrainians were transferred to a separate camp on 6 january and they had no relation to the uprising in solzhenitsyns camp on 22 january he also claimed that the only people who might in 1976 have access to a secret kgb archive were kgb agents themselves solzhenitsyn also requested arnau to put the alleged document to a  test but arnau used name potemschiki  
in 1990 the report was reproduced in soviet voyenno istoricheskiy zhurnal among the memoirs of la samutin  a former  soldier and gulag inmate who was an erstwhile supporter of solzhenitsyn but later became his critic according to solzhenitsyn publication of the samutin memoirs was canceled at the request of samutins widow who stated that the memoirs were in fact dictated by the kgb name potemschiki  
regarding atheism solzhenitsyn declared
in his 1974 essay repentance and self limitation in the life of nations pp 527–55  solzhenitsyn called for russian gentiles and jews alike to take moral responsibility for the renegades from both communities who enthusiastically created a   after the 
in a november 13 1985 review of solzhenitsyns novel august 1914 in the   historian  commented every culture has its own brand of anti semitism  in solzhenitsyns case its not racial it has nothing to do with blood hes certainly not a racist the question is fundamentally religious and cultural he bears some resemblance to  who was a fervent christian and patriot and a rabid anti semite solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the russian extreme rights view of the revolution which is that it was  p 490 
  survivor  denied this claim and insisted that solzhenitsyn was not an anti semite he is too intelligent too honest too courageous too great a writer he added he wished solzhenitsyn were more sensitive to jewish suffering but believed his insensitivity to be unconscious p 491 
in his 1998 book russia in collapse solzhenitsyn excoriated the russian extreme rights obsession with anti semitic and anti masonic  p 496 
in 2001 however solzhenitsyn published a two volume work on the history of russian jewish relations  2001 2002 a bestseller in russia the book triggered renewed accusations of     name young  
the controversy was fueled by the similarities between two hundred years together and an anti semitic essay titled jews in the ussr and in the future russia according to professor of jewish history  textological analyses of the essay indicate solzhenitsyns authorship 
solzhenitsyn responded by saying that the essay was written using manuscripts stolen from him by the kgb forty years before they were then caully edited as part of the soviet states  against him name young  
although two hundred years together has never been published in the  long excerpts from it appear in the solzhenitsyn reader the book began with a plea for patient mutual comprehension on the part of russian gentiles and jews solzhenitsyn explained that the book was conceived in the hope of promoting mutually agreeable and fruitful pathways for the future development of russian jewish relations p 489 
in chapter 9 solzhenitsyn said that it would be quite wrong to say that the jews organized the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 just as it was not organized by any other nation as such
at the end of chapter 15 solzhenitsyn expressed a belief that every people must answer morally for all of its past    including that past which is shameful in this spirit he urged the jewish people to answer both for the revolutionary cutthroats and the ranks willing to serve them it is not he insists a matter of answering before other peoples but to oneself to ones consciousness and before god he explains that russian gentiles must also repent for the s for those merciless arsonist peasants for those crazed revolutionary soldiers for those savage sailors to answer just as we would answer for members of our own family for if we release ourselves from any responsibility for the actions of our national kin the very concept of a people loses any real meaning p 505 
in some of his later political writings such as rebuilding russia 1990 and russia in collapse 1998 solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new russian democracy while opposing any nostalgia for soviet communism he defended moderate and self critical patriotism as opposed to  urged local self government to a free russia and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic russians in the  of the former soviet union
in a 2007 interview with  solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the conflation of soviet and russian against which i spoke so often in the 1970s has not passed away in the west in the ex socialist countries or in the former soviet republics the elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations with present day moscow as a convenient target they behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now while moscow has remained communist nevertheless i dare to hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history name solzhenitsyn 2007 
delivering the commencement address at  in 1978 he called the united states spiritually weak and mired in vulgar  americans he said speaking in russian through a translator suffered from a decline in courage and a lack of manliness few were willing to die for their ideals he said he condemned both the united states government and american society for its hasty capitulation in the  he criticized the countrys music as intolerable and attacked its  accusing it of violations of privacy he said that the west erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model  while faulting soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people he also faulted the west for being too legalistic a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities name harvard

an antipope  is a person who in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected  makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the popeone who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of rome endeavours to secure the papal throne and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt http  wwwbritannicacom ebchecked topic 28501 antipope encyclopædia britannica antipope  the  and leader of the  at times between the 3rd and mid 15th century antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious  and secular s and kingdoms persons who claim to be pope but have few followers such as the modern  antipopes are not classified with the historical antipopes
 dampnbsp235 is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope as he headed a separate group within the church in rome against  hippolytus was reconciled to callixtuss second successor  and both he and pontian are honoured as saints by the roman catholic church with a shared  on 13 august whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of hippolytus  and whether hippolytus actually declared himself to be the bishop of rome remains unclear since no such claim by hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him
 quotes v 28  from an unnamed earlier writer the story of natalius a  priest who accepted the bishopric of a heretical group in rome natalius soon repented and tearfully begged  to receive him into communion  
 d 258 another 3rd century figure certainly claimed the see of rome in opposition to  and if natalius and hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them novatian could then be said to be the first antipope
the period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the s of the 11th and 12th centuries the emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes the popes likewise sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants s in germany to overcome a particular emperor
the —which began in 1378 when the french cardinals claiming that the election of  was invalid elected  as pope—led to two and eventually three rival lines of claimants to the papacy the roman line the  clement vii took up residence in  france and the  line the pisan line was named after the town of pisa italy where the pisan council had elected  as a third claimant to end the schism in may 1415 the  deposed  of the pisan line  of the roman line resigned in july 1415 in 1417 the council also formally deposed  of avignon but he used to resign afterwards  was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to benedict xiii the scandal of the western schism created anti papal sentiment and fed into the  at the turn of the 16th century
the following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the  with the addition of the names of natalius in spite of doubts about his historicity and  whose following was insignificanthttp  wwwnewadventorg cathen 09725ahtm michael ott pope martin v in catholic encyclopedia new york 1910 
 
an asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later popes who took the same name more commonly the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers for example there was an  but the new pope john elected in 1958 was also called  for the additional confusion regarding popes named john see

thus because of the obscurities about mid 11th century canon law and the historical facts the annuario pontificio lists  as a pope without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy the  places him in its list of popes  but with the annotation considered by some to be an antipope other sources classify him as an antipope the shorter cambridge medieval history cambridge university press 1952 republished 1975 isbn 0 521 20962 5 vol 1 p 477 http  wwwgooglecom searchtbm bksamptbo 1ampq +darras+%22title+of+sylvester+iii%22ampbtng  joseph Épiphane darras a general history of the catholic church vol iii p 58

in  a subfield of  and  the kolmogorov complexity also known as descriptive complexity kolmogorov– complexity algorithmic entropy or program size complexity of an object such as a piece of text is a measure of the al resources needed to specify the object it is named after  who first published on the subject in 1963  
for example consider the following two  of 32 lowercase letters and digits
preabababababababababababababababab pre
pre4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7 pre
the first string has a short english language description namely ttab 16 times tt which consists of 11 characters the second one has no obvious simple description using the same character set other than writing down the string itself which has 32 characters
more formally the  of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed  description language the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below it can be shown that the kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself strings like the abab example above whose kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the strings size are not considered to be complex
the notion of kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to   and 
the kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings we must first specify a description language for strings  such a description language can be based on any computer programming language such as   or  bytecode  if p is a program which outputs a string x then p is a description of x the length of the description is just the length of p as a character string multiplied by the number of bits in a character eg 7 for 
we could alternatively choose an encoding for s where an encoding is a function which associates to each turing machine m a bitstring m if m is a turing machine which on input w outputs string x then the concatenated string m w is a description of x for theoretical analysis this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally perred in the research literature in this article an informal approach is discussed
any string s has at least one description namely the program
  function generatefixedstring
     return s
if a description of s ds is of minimal length ie it uses the fewest bits it is called a minimal description of s  thus the length of ds ie the number of bits in the description is the kolmogorov complexity of s written ks symbolically
ks    ds 
the length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language but the effect of changing languages is bounded a result called the invariance theorem
there are some description languages which are optimal in the following sense given any description of an object in a description language i can use that description in my optimal description language with a constant overhead the constant depends only on the languages involved not on the description of the object nor the object being described
here is an example of an optimal description language a description will have two parts
 the first part describes another description language
 the second part is a description of the object in that language
in more technical terms the first part of a description is a computer program with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output
the invariance theorem follows given any description language l the optimal description language is at least as efficient as l with some constant overhead
proof any description d in l can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing l as a computer program p part 1 and then using the original description d as input to that program part 2 the 
total length of this new description d’ is approximately
 d’     p  +  d 
the length of p is a constant that doesnt depend on d so there is at most a constant overhead regardless of the object described theore the optimal language is universal  this additive constant
theorem if ksub1 sub and ksub2 sub are the complexity functions relative to  description languages lsub1 sub and lsub2 sub then there is a constant c – which depends only on the languages lsub1 sub and lsub2 sub chosen – such that
∀s   c ≤ ksub1 subs   ksub2 subs ≤ c
proof by symmetry it suffices to prove that there is some constant c such that for all strings s
ksub1 subs ≤ ksub2 subs + c
now suppose there is a program in the language lsub1 sub which acts as an  for lsub2 sub
   function interpretlanguagestring p
where p is a program in lsub2 sub the interpreter is characterized by the following property
 running codeinterpretlanguage code on input p returns the result of running p
thus if p is a program in lsub2 sub which is a minimal description of s then codeinterpretlanguage codep returns the string s the length of this description of s is the sum of
# the length of the program codeinterpretlanguage code which we can take to be the constant c
# the length of p which by definition is ksub2 subs
this proves the desired upper bound
 is the area of computer science that studies kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings or other s
the concept and theory of kolmogorov complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by  who published it in 1960 describing it in a preliminary report on a general theory of inductive inference http  worldstdcom ~rjs z138pdf revision nov 1960  as part of his invention of  he gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications a formal theory of inductive inference part 1 and part 2 in information and control  
andrey kolmogorov later  this theorem in problems inform transmission  in 1965 gregory chaitin also presents this theorem in j acm – chaitins paper was submitted october 1966 and revised in december 1968 and cites both solomonoffs and kolmogorovs papers 
the theorem says that among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions codes there exists an optimal one this algorithm for all strings allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms but not on the strings themselves solomonoff used this algorithm and the code lengths it allows to define a universal probability of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings including complexity randomness and information
when kolmogorov became aware of solomonoffs work he acknowledged solomonoffs priority  for several years solomonoffs work was better known in the soviet union than in the western world the general consensus in the scientific community however was to associate this type of complexity with kolmogorov who was concerned with randomness of a sequence while algorithmic probability became associated with solomonoff who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution the broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called kolmogorov complexity the computer scientist ming li considers this an example of the   to everyone who has more will be given  
there are several other variants of kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information the most widely used one is based on s and is mainly due to  1974
an axiomatic approach to kolmogorov complexity based on  blum 1967 was introduced by mark burgin in the paper presented for publication by andrey kolmogorov burgin 1982
in the following discussion let ks be the complexity of the string s
it is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself   the program codegeneratefixedstring code above that outputs s is a fixed amount larger than s
theorem there is a constant c such that
∀s ks ≤  s  + c
theorem there exist strings of arbitrarily large kolmogorov complexity formally for each n ∈ ℕ there is a string s with ks ≥ n group notehowever an s with ks   n neednt exist for every n for example if n isnt a multiple of 7 bits no  program can have a length of exactly n bits 
proof otherwise all infinitely many possible strings could be generated by the finitely many group notethere are 1 + 2 + 2sup2 sup + 2sup3 sup +  + 2supn sup   2supn+1 sup ampminus 1 different program texts of length up to n bits cf  if program lengths are to be multiples of 7 bits even fewer program texts exist  programs with a complexity below n bits
theorem  k is not a  in other words there is no program which takes a string s as input and produces the integer ks as output
the following  uses a simple  like language to denote programs for sake of proof simplicity assume its description ie an  to have a length of  bits
assume for contradiction there is a program
   function kolmogorovcomplexitystring s
which takes as input a string s and returns ks for sake of proof simplicity assume its length to be  bits
now consider the following program of length  bits
   function generatecomplexstring
      for i   1 to infinity
         for each string s of length exactly i
            if kolmogorovcomplexitys   8000000000
               return s
using codekolmogorovcomplexity code as a subroutine the program tries every string starting with the shortest until it returns a string with kolmogorov complexity at least  bits group noteby the previous theorem such a string exists hence the codefor code loop will eventually terminate  ie a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than  bits however the overall length of the above program that produced s is only  bits group noteincluding the language interpreter and the subroutine code for codekolmogorovcomplexity code  which is a contradiction if the code of codekolmogorovcomplexity code is shorter the contradiction remains if it is longer the constant used in codegeneratecomplexstring code can always be changed appropriately group noteif codekolmogorovcomplexity code has length n bits the constant m used in codegeneratecomplexstring code needs to be adapted to satisfy  which is always possible since m grows faster than logsub10 subm 
the above proof used a contradiction similar to that of the  sub subthe sub subsmallest sub subpositive sub subinteger sub subthat sub subcannot sub subbe sub subdefined sub subin sub subfewer sub subthan sub subtwenty sub subenglish sub subwords it is also possible to show the non computability of k by reduction from the non computability of the halting problem h since k and h are stated without proof in http  wwwdaimiaudk ~bromille dc05 kolmogorovpdf course notes for data compression   kolmogorov complexity 2005 pb miltersen p7 
there is a corollary humorously called the  in the programming language community stating that there is no perfect size optimizing compiler
the chain rule  for kolmogorov complexity states that
kxy   kx + ky x + ologkxy
it states that the shortest program that reproduces x and y is  than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce x and a program to reproduce y given x using this statement one can define 
it is straightforward to compute upper bounds for ks – simply  the string s with some method implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string and measure the length of the resulting string – concretely the size of a  in the given language
a string s is compressible by a number c if it has a description whose length does not exceed  s ampminusc bits this is equivalent to saying that ks ≤  s  c  otherwise s is incompressible by c a string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply incompressible – by the  which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string s must exist since there are 2supn sup bit strings of length n but only 2supn sup   1 shorter strings that is strings of length less than n ie with length 01nampnbspampminusampnbsp1 group noteas there are  strings of length l the number of strings of lengths  is     which is a finite  with sum     
for the same reason most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed – their ks is not much smaller than  s  the length of s in bits to make this precise fix a value of n there are 2supn sup bitstrings of length n the   distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2sup−n sup to each string of length n
theorem with the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length n the probability that a string is incompressible by c is at least 1   2sup−c+1 sup + 2sup−n sup
to prove the theorem note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding n c is given by the geometric series
1 + 2 + 2sup2 sup +  + 2supn c sup   2supn c+1 sup   1
there remain at least
2supn sup   2supn c+1 sup + 1
bitstrings of length n that are incompressible by c  to determine the probability divide by 2supn sup
we know that in the set of all possible strings most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly compressed way however it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold the precise formalization is as follows first fix a particular  s for the s the axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that to certain assertions  a about complexity of strings one can associate a formula fsuba sub in s this association must have the following property
if fsuba sub is provable from the axioms of s then the corresponding assertion a must be true this formalization can be achieved either by an artificial encoding such as a  or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of s
theorem there exists a constant l which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language such that there does not exist a string s for which the statement
ks ≥  l as formalized in s
can be proven within the axiomatic system s
note that by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings the vast majority of those statements must be true
the proof of this result is modeled on a self erential construction used in  the proof is by contradiction if the theorem were false then
assumption x for any integer n there exists a string s for which there is a proof in s of the formula ksampnbsp≥ampnbspn which we assume can be formalized in s
we can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in s by some procedure
   function nthproofint n
which takes as input n and outputs some proof this function enumerates all proofs some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here since every possible proof in the language of s is produced for some n some of these are complexity formulas of the form ksampnbsp≥ampnbspn where s and n are constants in the language of s there is a program
   function nthproofprovescomplexityformulaint n
which determines whether the nth proof actually proves a complexity formula ksampnbsp≥ampnbspl the strings s and the integer l in turn are computable by programs
   function stringnthproofint n
   function complexitylowerboundnthproofint n
consider the following program
   function generateprovablycomplexstringint n
      for i   1 to infinity
         if  nthproofprovescomplexityformulai and complexitylowerboundnthproofi ≥ n
            return stringnthproofi
given an n this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the  s of the formula ksampnbsp≥ampnbspl for some lampnbsp≥ampnbspn the program terminates by our assumption x now this program has a length u there is an integer nsub0 sub such that uampnbsp+ampnbsplogsub2 subnsub0 subampnbsp+ampnbspcampnbspampnbspnsub0 sub where c is the overhead cost of
    function generateprovablyparadoxicalstring
       return generateprovablycomplexstringnsub0 sub
note that nsub0 sub is hard coded into the above function and the summand logsub2 subnsub0 sub already allows for its encoding the program generateprovablyparadoxicalstring outputs a string s for which there exists an l such that ksampnbsp≥ampnbspl can be formally proved in s with lampnbsp≥ampnbspnsub0 sub in particular ksampnbsp≥ampnbspnsub0 sub is true however s is also described by a program of length uampnbsp+ampnbsplogsub2 subnsub0 subampnbsp+ampnbspc so its complexity is less than nsub0 sub  this contradiction proves assumption x cannot hold
similar ideas are used to prove the properties of 
the  principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by  and dm boulton in 1968 mml is  ie it incorporates prior beliefs and information theoretic it has the desirable properties of statistical invariance ie the inference transforms with a re parametrisation such as from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates statistical consistency ie even for very hard problems mml will converge to any underlying model and efficiency ie the mml model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible cs wallace and dl dowe 1999 showed a formal connection between mml and algorithmic information theory or kolmogorov complexity
kolmogorov randomness – also called algorithmic randomness – defines a string usually of s as being  if and only if it is shorter than any  that can produce that string  to make this precise a  or universal turing machine must be specified so that program means a program for this universal machine a random string in this sense is incompressible in that it is impossible to compress the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself  a  is used to show that for any universal computer there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length  whether any particular string is random however depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen
this definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for infinite sequences from a finite alphabet these s can be defined in three equivalent ways one way uses an effective analogue of  another uses effective   the third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the pix free kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough   there must be a constant c such that the complexity of an initial segment of length n is always at least nampminusc  this definition unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string is not affected by which universal machine is used to define pix free kolmogorov complexity
 
for dynamical systems entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of brudno that the equality kxt    ht holds for almost all x 
it can be shown  that for the output of s kolmogorov complexity is related to the  of the information source more precisely the kolmogorov complexity of the output of a markov information source normalized by the length of the output converges almost surely as the length of the output goes to infinity to the  of the source
the conditional kolmogorov complexity of two strings kx y is roughly speaking defined as the kolmogorov complexity of x given y as an auxiliary input to the procedure name rissanen2007  
there is also a length conditional complexity kx lx which is the complexity of x given the length of x as known input

the triumph of time is a poem by  published in  in 1866 it is in adapted  and is full of elaborate use of literary devices particularly  the theme which purports to be autobiographical is that of rejected love the speaker deplores the ruin of his life and in tones at times reminiscent of  craves oblivion for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor

alfred the great 849 – 26 october 899  elf counsel or wise elf was king of  from 871 to 899
alfred successfully defended his kingdom against the  attempt at conquest and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in yorke alfred  he is one of only two english monarchs to be given the  the great the other being the scandinavian  he was also the first  to style himself king of the  details of alfreds life are described in a work by the   scholar and bishop  a devout  alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level headed nature who encouraged education and improved his kingdoms  system  structure and his peoples quality of life
alfred was born in the village of wanating now   he was the youngest son of king  by his first wife alfred was the youngest of either four weir alison britains royal families the complete genealogy 1989 p5 or five brothers http  wwwroyalgovuk historyofthemonarchy kingsandqueensofengland theanglo saxonkings alfredthegreataspx the primary record conflicting regarding whether  was a brother or uncle 
in 853 at the age of four alfred is said to have been sent to  where according to the  name aschronhttp  wwwgutenbergorg files 657 657txt the anglo saxon chronicle freely licensed version at gutenberg project note this electronic edition is a collation of material from nine diverse extant versions of the chronicle it contains primarily the translation of rev james ingram as published in the everyman edition  he was confirmed by  who anointed him as king  writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory  in preparation for his ultimate succession to the throne of wessex however his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as alfred had three living elder brothers a letter of leo iv shows that alfred was made a  a misinterpretation of this investiture deliberate or accidental could explain later confusion it may also be based on alfreds later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to rome where he spent some time at the court of   around 854–855
on their return from rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed by his son  with civil war looming the s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise Æthelbald would retain the western shires ie traditional wessex and Æthelwulf would rule in the east when king Æthelwulf died in 858 wessex was ruled by three of alfreds brothers in succession Æthelbald  and  
bishop asser tells the story of how as a child alfred won a prize of a volume of poetry in saxon offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize itasserius de rebus gestis aelfredi florentius wigorniensis 23 ad 866  legend also has it that the young alfred spent time in ireland seeking healing alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life it is thought that he may have suffered from  name rsm303   statues of alfred in winchester and wantage portray him as a great warrior evidence suggests he was not physically strong and though not lacking in courage he was noted more for his intellect than a warlike charactercornwell bernard 2009 historical note p 385 and following in the burning land harper 
during the short reigns of the older two of his three elder brothers  and  alfred is not mentioned an army of  which the anglo saxon chronicle described as the  had landed in east anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted anglo saxon england in 865 name keyns16keynes  lapidge alfred the great pp16–17  it was with the backdrop of a rampaging viking army that alfreds public life began with the accession of his third brother  in 865
it is during this period that bishop asser applied to alfred the unique title of secundarius which may indicate a position akin to that of the ic  a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch it is possible that this arrangement was sanctioned by alfreds father or by the  to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle the arrangement of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well known among other   such as the  and  to whom the anglo saxons were closely related
in 868 alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the great heathen army led by  out of the adjoining  name aschron  at the end of 870 the danes arrived in his homeland the year which followed has been called alfreds year of battles nine engagements were fought with varying outcomes though the place and date of two of these battles have not been recorded
in berkshire a successful skirmish at the  on 31 december 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the  by ivars brother  on 5 january 871 four days later the anglo saxons won a brilliant victory at the  on the  possibly near  or  alfred is particularly credited with the success of this latter battle
later that month on 22 january the saxons were defeated at the  they were defeated again on 22 march at the  perhaps marden in  or martin in  Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 april
in april 871 king Æthelred died and alfred succeeded to the throne of wessex and the burden of its defence despite the fact that Æthelred left two under age sons  and  this was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at swinbeorg the brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that king Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will the deceaseds sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired the unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king given the ongoing danish invasion and the youth of his nephews alfreds accession probably went uncontested
while he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother the danes defeated the saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at  in may the defeat at wilton smashed any remaining hope that alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom he was forced instead to make peace with them according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were bishop asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise
indeed the viking army did withdraw from reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in mercian london although not mentioned by asser or by the anglo saxon chronicle alfred probably also paid the vikings cash to leave much as the mercians were to do in the following year s dating to the viking occupation of london in 871 2 have been excavated at   and  these finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the vikings for the next five years the danes occupied other parts of englandbrooks np and ja graham campbell reflections on the viking age silver hoard from croydon  in anglo saxon monetary history essays in memory of michael dolley 1986 pp 91–110 
in 876 under their new leader  the danes slipped past the saxon army and attacked and occupied  in  alfred blockaded them but was unable to take wareham by assault accordingly he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths which the danes swore on a holy ring name aschron  associated with the worship of  the danes however broke their word and after killing all the hostages slipped away under cover of night to  in  name aschron 
alfred blockaded the viking ships in devon and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm the danes were forced to submit the danes withdrew to mercia in january 878 the danes made a sudden attack on  a royal stronghold in which alfred had been staying over christmas and most of the people they killed except the king alfred and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp and after easter he made a fort at  in the marshes of  and from that fort kept fighting against the foe name aschron  from his fort at  an island in the marshes near  alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement rallying the local s from   and 
a popular legend originating from 12th century chronicles  tells how when he first fled to the  alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who unaware of his identity left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return
878 was the low water mark in the history of the anglo saxon kingdoms with all the other kingdoms having fallen to the vikings wessex alone was still resisting p 101 
in the seventh week after easter 4–10 may 878 around  alfred rode to  east of  where he was met by all the people of somerset and of  and of that part of  which is on this side of the sea that is west of  and they rejoiced to see him name aschron  alfreds emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a caully planned offensive that entailed raising the s of three s this meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of  royal s and kings s who were charged with levying and leading these forces but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war alfreds actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers name lavelle187 
alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing  which may have been fought near  he then pursued the danes to their stronghold at  and starved them into submission one of the terms of the surrender was that guthrum convert to  three weeks later the danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at alfreds court at aller near  with alfred receiving guthrum as his spiritual son
the unbinding of the chrism took place with great ceremony eight days later at the royal estate at  in somerset after which guthrum fulfilled his promise to leave wessex there is no contemporary evidence that alfred and guthrum agreed upon a formal treaty at this time the so called  is an invention of modern historians the  preserved in  in  manuscript 383 and in a  compilation known as  was negotiated later perhaps in 879 or 880 when king  was deposed
that treaty divided up the kingdom of mercia by its terms the boundary between alfreds and guthrums kingdoms was to run up the  to the  follow the lea to its source near  from there extend in a straight line to  and from bedford follow the  to  name attenboroughhttp  archiveorg stream lawsofearliesten00grea#page 98 mode 2up treaty of alfred and gunthrum 
in other words alfred succeeded to ceolwulfs kingdom consisting of western mercia and guthrum incorporated the eastern part of mercia into an enlarged  henceforward known as the  by terms of the treaty moreover alfred was to have control over the mercian city of london and its mints—at least for the time beingblackburn mas blackburn the london mint in the reign of alfred in kings currency and alliances history and coinage of southern england in the 9th century ed mas blackburn and dn dumville 1998 pp 105–24  the disposition of  held by west saxon kings since the days of  is unclear from the treaty though given alfreds political and military superiority it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson
with the signing of the  an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when guthrums people began settling  guthrum was neutralised as a threat p 94   in conjunction with this agreement a danish army left the island and sailed to  name asser86 p 86 
alfred was still forced to contend with a number of danish threats a year later in 881 alfred fought a small sea battle against four danish ships on the high seas name asser86  two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to alfreds forces p 76  similar small skirmishes with independent viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period as they had for decades
in the year 883 though there is some debate over the year king alfred because of his support and his donation of alms to rome received a number of gifts from the  p 78   among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the  a true treasure for the devout saxon king according to asser because of pope marinus friendship with king alfred the pope granted an exemption to any anglo saxons residing within rome from tax or tribute p 88 
after the signing of the treaty with guthrum alfred was spared any large scale conflicts for some time despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of danish raids and incursions among these was a raid taking place in  an allied country in  during the year 885 which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with guthrum assers account of the raid places the danish raiders at the saxon city of  name asser86  where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city in response to this incursion alfred led an  force against the danes who instead of engaging the army of wessex fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of britain the retreating danish force supposedly left britain the following summer name asser 1983 p 87 
not long after the failed danish raid in kent alfred dispatched his fleet to east anglia the purpose of this expedition is debated though asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder name asser 1983  after travelling up the  the fleet was met by danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 sources vary on the number and a battle ensued name asser 1983   the anglo saxon fleet emerged victorious and as huntingdon accounts laden with spoils p 81   the victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the river stour and was attacked by a danish force at the mouth of the river the danish fleet was able to defeat alfreds fleet which may have been weakened in the previous engagement p 86 
a year later in 886 alfred reoccupied the city of  and set out to make it habitable again p 24  alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son in law   of mercia the restoration of london progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan added fortifications in addition to the existing roman walls and some believe the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the  p 23 
this is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the saxon people of pre unification england submitted to alfred p 106  this was not however the point at which alfred came to be known as king of england in fact he would never adopt the title for himself in truth the power which alfred wielded over the english peoples at this time seemed to stem largely from the military might of the west saxons alfreds political connections from having the ruler of mercia as his son in law and alfreds keen administrative talents
between the restoration of  and the resumption of large scale danish attacks in the early 890s alfreds reign was rather uneventful the relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of alfreds sister Æthelswith who died en route to rome in 888 p 114  in the same year the  Æthelred also died one year later guthrum or athelstan by his baptismal name alfreds former enemy and king of east anglia died and was buried in  p 89 
guthrums passing changed the political landscape for alfred the resulting power vacuum stirred up other power–hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years the quiet years of alfreds life were coming to a close and war was on the horizon
after another lull in the autumn of 892 or 893 the danes attacked again finding their position in mainland europe precarious they crossed to england in 330 ships in two divisions they entrenched themselves the larger body at  and the lesser under  at  also in kent the invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation alfred in 893 or 894 took up a position from which he could observe both forces name merkle 2009 page 220 
while he was in talks with hastein the danes at appledore broke out and struck northwestwards they were overtaken by alfreds eldest son  and were defeated in a general engagement at  in  they took uge on an island at  on  where they were blockaded and were ultimately forced to submit name merkle 2009 page 220  the force fell back on essex and after suffering another defeat at  coalesced with hasteins force at 
alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at thorney when he heard that the n and east anglian danes were besieging  and an unnamed stronghold on the  shore alfred at once hurried westward and raised the  of  the fate of the other place is not recorded
meanwhile the force under hastein set out to march up the  possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of   and  and forced to head off to the northwest being finally overtaken and blockaded at  some identify this with buttington tump at the mouth of the  others with buttington near  an attempt to break through the english lines was defeated those who escaped retreated to shoebury after collecting reinforcements they made a sudden dash across england and occupied the ruined  walls of  the english did not attempt a winter  but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district
early in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the danes to retire once more to  at the end of the year the danes drew their ships up the  and  and fortified themselves twenty miles 32ampnbspkm north of london a direct attack on the danish lines failed but later in the year alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the danish ships the danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred they struck off north westwards and wintered at  near  the next year 896 or 897 they gave up the struggle some retired to  some to  those who had no connections in england withdrew back to the continent
the germanic tribes who invaded britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their  or fyrd and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early anglo saxon england depended name preston70   the fyrd was a local  in the anglo saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve those who used military service were subject to fines or loss of their land name hollister59

wessexs history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the danes advantage while both the anglo saxons and the danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources they employed very different strategies in their raids the anglo saxons traditionally perred to attack head on by assembling their forces in a  advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence name abels 1998 pages 194–5 
in contrast the danes perred to choose easy targets mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high stake attacks for more alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance name abels 1998 pages 194–5 
 
these bases were prepared in advance often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches  and s once inside the fortification alfred realised the danes enjoyed the advantage better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned name abels 1998 pages 194–5 
the means by which the anglo saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the vikings it was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids the king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom however in the case of hit and run raids by vikings problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough it was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived and although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with guthrum  name cannon398 
with these lessons in mind alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdoms military defences on a trip to rome alfred had stayed with  and it is possible that he may have studied how the carolingian kings had dealt with the viking problem and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom also there had been a system of fortifications in pre viking mercia that may have been an influence so when the viking raids resumed in 892 alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing mobile field army a network of garrisons and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries  name keynes14
  name lavelle212 
tenants in anglo saxon england had a threefold obligation based on their landholding the so called common burdens of military service fortress work and bridge repair this threefold obligation has traditionally been called trinoda neccessitas or trimoda neccessitas name lavelle70   the old english name for the fine due for neglecting military service was  fierdwite or fyrdwitee name attenborough52  
to maintain the s and to reorganize the fyrd as a standing army alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenants landholding the hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenants public obligations were assessed a hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family the hide would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned name lavelle70   name lapidge238 
at the centre of alfreds ormed military defence system was the network of s distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom  there were thirty three in total spaced approximately  apart enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day  
alfreds burhs later termed  ranged from former roman towns such as winchester where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches probably reinforced with wooden s and palisades such as at burpham sussex name welch127   the size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as pilton to large fortifications in established towns the largest at  which is erenced in  
a contemporary document now known as the  provides an insight into how the system worked it lists the hidage for each of the fortified towns contained in the document for example wallingford had a hidage of 2400 which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2400 men the number sufficient for maintaining  of wall name rumble5   a total of 27071 soldiers were needed system wide or approximately one in four of all the free men in wessex 
many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and connected by a fortified bridge like those built by  a generation before name keynes14  the double burh blocked passage on the river forcing viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones spears or arrows other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas allowing the king better control over his strongholds 
this network of well garrisoned burhs posed significant obstacles to viking invaders especially those laden with booty the system threatened viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the viking raiders however the vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against the burh and a developed doctrine of  having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications the only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this allowed the king time to send assistance with his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs in such cases the vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the kings joint military forces   alfreds burh system posed such a formidable challenge against viking attack that when the vikings returned in 892 and successfully stormed a half made poorly garrisoned fortress up the lympne estuary in  the anglo saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of wessex and mercia 
alfreds burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution his contemporary biographer asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for the common needs of the kingdomasser translated by    
alfred also tried his hand at naval design in 896 name p111 p 111  he ordered the construction of a small fleet perhaps a dozen or so longships that at 60 oars were twice the size of viking warships this was not as the victorians asserted the birth of the  wessex possessed a royal fleet before this  of kent and ealdorman ealhhere had defeated a viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships pp 86–88  and alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882 p 97 
but clearly the author of the anglo saxon chronicle and probably alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of wessex the chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that alfreds ships were not only larger but swifter steadier and rode higher in the water than either danish or frisian ships it is probable that under the classical tutelage of asser alfred utilised the design of  with high sides designed for fighting rather than for navigation name abels 1998 305–307 cf the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in  pp 281–89 
alfred had seapower in mind—if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed he could spare his kingdom from ravaging alfreds ships may have been superior in conception in practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers the only places in which a naval battle could occur name abels 1998 305–307 
the warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but troop carriers it has been suggested that like sea battles in late viking age scandinavia these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel at which point the crew would lash the two ships together before boarding the enemy craft the result was effectively a land battle involving hand to hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels name lavelle286 
in the one recorded naval engagement in the year 896 name aschron  name p111  alfreds new fleet of nine ships intercepted six viking ships in the mouth of an unidentified river along the south of england the danes had beached half their ships and gone inland name p111  either to rest their rowers or to forage for food alfreds ships immediately moved to block their escape to the sea the three viking ships afloat attempted to break through the english lines name p111  only one made it alfreds ships intercepted the other two name p111 
lashing the viking boats to their own the english crew boarded the enemys vessels and proceeded to kill everyone on board the one ship that escaped managed to do so only because all of alfreds heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out name lavelle286   what ensued was a land battle between the crews of the grounded ships the danes heavily outnumbered would have been wiped out if the tide had not risen when that occurred the danes rushed back to their boats which being lighter with shallower drafts were freed before alfreds ships helplessly the english watched as the vikings rowed past them name lavelle286  the pirates had suffered so many casualties 120 danes dead against 62 frisians and english name p111  that they had difficulties putting out to sea all were too damaged to row around sussex and two were driven against the sussex coast possibly at  name p111  name lavelle286  the shipwrecked sailors were brought before alfred at winchester and were hanged name p111 
in the late 880s or early 890s alfred issued a long  or  consisting of his own laws followed by a code issued by his late seventh century predecessor king  name attenborough62attenborough the laws of the earliest english kings http  archiveorg stream lawsofearliesten00grea#page 62 mode 2up alfreds laws retrieved 9 june 2013 pp62–93  together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters in his introduction alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many  books and ordered to be written many of the ones that our foathers observed—those that pleased me and many of the ones that did not please me i rejected with the advice of my councillors and commanded them to be observed in a different wayalfred int 499 trans  p 164 
alfred singled out in particular the laws that he found in the days of ine my kinsman or  king of the mercians or king  who first among the english people received baptism he appended rather than integrated the laws of ine into his code and although he included as had Æthelbert a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts the two injury tariffs are not aligned offa is not known to have issued a law code leading historian  to speculate that alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to offa by two papal legates 
about a fifth of the law code is taken up by alfreds introduction which includes translations into english of the  a few chapters from the  and the apostolic letter from  1523–29 the introduction may best be understood as alfreds meditation upon the meaning of christian law p 215  it traces the continuity between gods gift of law to moses to alfreds own issuance of law to the west saxon people by doing so it links the holy past to the historical present and represents alfreds law giving as a type of divine legislation
this is the reason that alfred divided his code into precisely 120 chapters 120 was the age at which moses died and in the number symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes 120 stood for law  the link between the mosaic law and alfreds code is the apostolic letter which explained that christ had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them and he taught mercy and meekness intro 491 the mercy that christ infused into mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since christian synods established through that mercy which christ taught that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed name keynesalfred intro 497 trans  pp 164–5 
the only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money is treachery to a lord since almighty god adjudged none for those who despised him nor did christ the son of god adjudge any for the one who betrayed him to death and he commanded everyone to love his lord as himself name keynes  alfreds transformation of christs commandment from love your neighbour as yourself matt 2239–40 to love your secular lord as you would love the lord christ himself underscores the importance that alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by god for the governance of man cites alfreds pastoral care ch 28 
when one turns from the dombocs introduction to the laws themselves it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement the impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws the law code as it has been preserved is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits in fact several of alfreds laws contradict  that form an integral part of the code patrick wormalds explanation is that alfreds law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction  in practical terms the most important law in the code may well be the very first we enjoin what is most necessary that each man keep caully his oath and his pledge which expresses a fundamental tenet of anglo saxon lawalfred 2 in  p 164 
alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness alfred according to asser insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and would caully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed issued in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjustasser chap 106 in  p 109  a charter from the reign of his son edward the elder depicts alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his handsthe charter is sawyer 1445 and is printed in english historical documents vol 1 ed dorothy whitelock 2nd edn 1979 pp 544–46 
asser represents alfred as a ic judge painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments although asser never mentions alfreds law code he does say that alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves to the pursuit of wisdom the failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of officeasser chap 106 in  pp 109–10 
the anglo saxon chronicle commissioned at the time of alfred was probably written to promote unification of england name parker48  whereas assers the life of king alfred  promoted alfreds achievements and personal qualities it was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in wales as alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country name parker48 
asser speaks grandiosely of alfreds relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available his interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of  he corresponded with  the  and embassies to rome conveying the english alms to the  were fairly frequentsome versions of the anglo saxon chronicle reported that alfred sent a delegation to india but this could just mean asia and other versions say iudea abels alfred the great pp 190–92  around 890  undertook a journey from  on  along the  to the n trading town of  alfred personally collected details of this trip 
alfreds relations with the celtic princes in the western half of  are clearer comparatively early in his reign according to asser the  princes owing to the pressure on them from  and  commended themselves to alfred later in his reign the  followed their example and the latter cooperated with the english in the campaign of 893 or 894 that alfred sent alms to irish and continental monasteries may be taken on assers authority the visit of the three pilgrim scots ie irish to alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic the story that he himself in his childhood was sent to ireland to be healed by saint  though mythical may show alfreds interest in that island
in the 880s at the same time that he was cajoling and threatening his nobles to build and man the s alfred perhaps inspired by the example of  almost a century before undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning it entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from mercia wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the  the establishment of a court school to educate his own children the sons of his nobles and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority a series of translations into the vernacular of latin works the king deemed most necessary for all men to know name lapidge28  the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of alfreds kingdom and house with a genealogy that stretched back to adam thus giving the west saxon kings a biblical ancestry name gransden34 
very little is known of the church under alfred the danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries and though alfred founded monasteries at athelney and shaftesbury these were the first new monastic houses in wessex since the beginning of the eighth centuryyorke barbara wessex in the early middle ages1995 p 201  according to asser alfred enticed foreign monks to england for his monastery at athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life name asser103 
alfred undertook no systematic orm of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in wessex for him the key to the kingdoms spiritual revival was to appoint pious learned and trustworthy bishops and abbots as king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for alfred name ranft78  name sweet8http  archiveorg stream kingalfredswests00greg#page 2 mode 2up the anglo saxon version of gregorys pastoral pp 1–9 retrieved 16 september 2013 
he was equally comfortable distributing his translation of s  to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands especially estates along the border with the danelaw and transferring them to royal s and officials who could better defend them against viking attacks name sweet8   
the danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in england alfred lamented in the pace to his translation of gregorys pastoral care that learning had declined so thoroughly in england that there were very few men on this side of the humber who could understand their divine services in english or even translate a single letter from latin into english and i suppose that there were not many beyond the humber either p 125  alfred undoubtedly exaggerated for dramatic effect the abysmal state of learning in england during his youth that latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned mercian and west saxon clerics such as plegmund wæferth and wulfsige
manuscript production in england dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the viking invasions began in earnest not to be revived until the end of the centurydumville david wessex and england from alfred to edgar six essays on political cultural and ecclesiastical revival 1992 p 190  numerous anglo saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them and a solemn diploma from  dated 873 is so poorly constructed and written that historian  posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no latin it is clear brooks concludes that the metropolitan church of canterbury must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in christian worshipbrooks nicholas the early history of the church of canterbury christ church from 597 to 1066 1984 pp 172–73 
following the example of  alfred established a court school for the education of his own children those of the nobility and a good many of lesser birth name lapidge28  there they studied books in both english and latin and devoted themselves to writing to such an extent  they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal artsasser chap 75 in  pp 99–1 cf codicology of the court school of charlemagne gospel book production illumination and emphasised script european university studies series 28 history of art  he recruited scholars from the continent and from britain to aid in the revival of christian learning in wessex and to provide the king personal instruction  and john the saxon came from francia plegmund whom alfred appointed archbishop of canterbury in 890 bishop werferth of worcester Æthelstan and the royal chaplains werwulf from mercia and asser from st davids in southwestern wales name lapidge92 
alfreds educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school believing that without christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war alfred aimed to set to learning as long as they are not useful for some other employment all the free born young men now in england who have the means to apply themselves to it name pgregpace to alfreds translation of gregory the greats pastoral care in  p 126  conscious of the decay of latin literacy in his realm alfred proposed that primary education be taught in english with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in latin name asser p 126asser p 126 
a problem however was that there were few books of wisdom written in english alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court centred programme of translating into english the books he deemed most necessary for all men to know name asser p 126  it is unknown when alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when wessex was enjoying a respite from viking attacks
apart from the lost handboc or encheiridion which seems to have been a  kept by the king the earliest work to be translated was the dialogues of  a book greatly popular in the  the translation was undertaken at alfreds command by   with the king merely furnishing a pace remarkably alfred undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars translated four works himself gregory the greats pastoral care s  s soliloquies and the first fifty psalms of the  name bately janet 1970 pp 45bately janet king alfred and the old english translation of orosius anglia 88 1970 433–60 idem those books that are most necessary for all men to know the classics and late ninth century england a reappraisal in the classics in the middle ages ed aldo s bernardo and saul levin 1990 pp 45–78 
one might add to this list alfreds translation in his law code of excerpts from the  book of exodus the old english versions of s histories against the pagans and s  are no longer accepted by scholars as alfreds own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences name bately janet 1970 pp 45  nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the alfredian programme of translation  and  suggest this also for balds leechbook and the anonymous old english martyrology pp 33–4 
alfreds first translation was of pope gregory the greats pastoral care which he paced with an introduction explaining why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this one from latin into english although he described his method as translating sometimes word for word sometimes sense for sense alfreds translation actually keeps very close to his original although through his choice of language he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority alfred meant his translation to be used and circulated it to all his bishops interest in alfreds translation of pastoral care was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century 
boethius consolation of philosophy was the most popular philosophical handbook of the middle ages unlike his translation of the pastoral care alfred here deals very freely with his original and though the late dr g schepssdr g schepss zu könig alfreds boethius in archiv für das studium der neueren sprachen xciv 1895 pp 149–160  showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to alfred himself but to the glosses and commentaries which he used still there is much in the work which is solely alfreds and highly characteristic of his style it is in the boethius that the oft quoted sentence occurs my will was to live worthily as long as i lived and after my life to leave to them that should come after my memory in good works the book has come down to us in two manuscripts only in one of theseoxford bodleian library ms bodley 180  the writing is prose in the otherbritish library cotton ms otho a vi  a combination of prose and alliterating verse
the latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centurieskiernan kevin s http  wwwukyedu ~kiernan iconic iconichtm alfred the greats burnt boethius in bornstein george and theresa tinkle eds the iconic page in manuscript print and digital culture ann arbor university of michigan press 1998  and the authorship of the verse has been much disputed but likely it also is by alfred in fact he writes in the prelude that he first created a prose work and then used it as the basis for his poem  he spent a great deal of time working on these books which he tells us he gradually wrote through the many stressful times of his reign to resh his mind of the authenticity of the work as a whole there seems to be little doubt name lapidge296 
the last of alfreds works is one to which he gave the name blostman ie blooms or anthology the first half is based mainly on the soliloquies of st  the remainder is drawn from various sources and contains much that is alfreds own and highly characteristic of him the last words of it may be quoted they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of english kings theore he seems to me a very foolish man and truly wretched who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear alfred appears as a character in the twelfth  or thirteenth century poem  where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised  a thirteenth century work contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom name parker115 
the  discovered in  in 1693 has long been associated with king alfred because of its  inscription aelfred mec heht gewyrcan alfred ordered me to be made the jewel is about  long made of filigreed gold enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set a cloisonné enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres perhaps personifying sight or the wisdom of god pp 189–91 
it was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base the jewel certainly dates from alfreds reign although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the æstels—pointers for reading—that alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the pastoral care each æstel was worth the princely sum of 50 es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the alfred jewel name lapidge203 
historian richard abels sees alfreds educational and military orms as complementary restoring religion and learning in wessex abels contends was to alfreds mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs as alfred observed in the pace to his english translation of gregory the greats pastoral care kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people pp 124–5  the pursuit of wisdom he assured his readers of the boethius was the surest path to power study wisdom then and when you have learned it condemn it not for i tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power yea even though not desiring itsedgefield wj king alfreds version of the consolations of boethius done into modern english 1900 p 35 
the portrayal of the west saxon resistance to the vikings by asser and the chronicler as a christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda it lected alfreds own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical christian world order in which god is the lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers the need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the common good led alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as offa as well as clerical writers such as bede alcuin and the other luminaries of the  this was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in alfreds worldview he believed as did other kings in ninth century england and francia that god had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people if the christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference he was answerable before god as josiah had been alfreds ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people
 wrote of alfred in his blockquotenow he was greatly loved more than all his brothers by his father and mother—indeed by everybody—with a universal and profound love and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else  he was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers and more pleasing in manner speech and behaviour  and in spite of all the demands of the present life it has been the desire for wisdom more than anything else together with the nobility of his birth which have characterized the nature of his noble mindkeynes simon and michael lapidge alfred the great assers  and other contemporary sources london penguin classics 1983 pages 74–75  blockquote
it is also written by asser that alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later which is described as shameful negligence of his parents and tutors it is true however that alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well a story is told by asser about how his mother held up a book of saxon poetry to him and his brothers and said i shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest after excitedly asking will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you alfred then took it to his teacher learned it and recited it back to his mother name keynes simon 1983 page 75keynes simon and lapidge p 75 
alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book probably an ancient version of a small pocket notebook which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected asser writes these he collected in a single book as i have seen for myself amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer and was inseparable from it name keynes simon 1983 page 75 
an excellent hunter in every branch of the sport alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody’s skills could compare name keynes simon 1983 page 75 
although he was the youngest of his brothers he was probably the most open minded despite eventually becoming one of the greatest warriors and forgers of peace in the kingdom he was an early advocate for education his desire for learning could have come from his early love of english poetry and inability to read or physically record them until later in life asser writes that alfred could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most namely the liberal arts for as he used to say there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the west saxons at that time name keynes simon 1983 page 75 
in 868 alfred married  daughter of a mercian nobleman Æthelred mucil  of the  the gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the mercians ealhswiths mother eadburh was a member of the mercian royal family pp 77 240–241

osferth was described as a relative in king alfreds will and he attested charters in a high position until 934 a charter of king edwards reign described him as the kings brother mistakenly according to keynes and lapidge but in the view of  he probably was an illegitimate son of king alfredkeynes amp lapidge p 322 n 79 nelson pp 60–62

algardis first major commission came about in 1634 when cardinal ubaldini medici contracted for a funeral monument for his great uncle  the third of the  popes who had reigned for less than a month in 1605 the monument was started in 1640 and mostly completed by 1644 the arrangement mirrors the one designed by bernini for the tomb of  1628–47 with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing while at his feet two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus however in berninis tomb the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below wherein the figures of charity and justice are either distracted by putti or lost in contemplation while skeletal death actively writes the epitaph algardis tomb is much less dynamic the allegorical figures of magnanimity and liberality have an impassive ethereal dignity some have identified the helmeted figure of magnanimity with that of  and iconic images of wisdomharriet f senie the tomb of leo xi by alessandro algardi the art bulletin 1978 pp 90–95  liberality resembles  famous santa susanna but rendered more elegant the tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of urban viiis tombboucher pp 121–2

algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa the villa pamphili now  outside the porta san pancrazio in rome he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect engineer  and help with supervising its construction from his assistant montagu jennifer alessandro algardi vol 1 yale 1985 pp 94–6  the casino was a showcase for the pamphili collection of sculpture ancient and contemporary on which algardi was well able to advise in the villa grounds algardi and his studio executed sculpture encrusted fountains and other garden features where some of his free standing sculpture and bas reliefs remain
in 1650 algardi met  who obtained commissions for his work from  as a consequence there are four chimney pieces by algardi in the  and in the gardens the figures on the fountain of  are also by him the augustinian monastery at  contains the tomb of the count and countess de monterey another work by algardi
algardis large dramatic marble high relief panel of pope leo and attilahttp  wwwwgahu frames ehtml html a algardi 2 meetinghtml pope leo and atilla relief 164653 for  and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs there had been large marble reliefs used previously in roman churchesfor example gian lorenzos father s crowded assumption of the virgin for 1606  but for most patrons sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly in this relief the two principal figures the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened  surge forward from the center into three dimensions only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the popes defense while all others in the background reliefs persist in performing their respective earthly duties
the subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes leo with supernatural aid deterred the huns from looting rome from a  standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man no doubt part of his patrons message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies
algardi died in rome within a year of completing his famous relief which was admired by contemporaries
in his later years algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune algardis classicizing manner was carried on by pupils including  and   initially trained with him the latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the vision of saint nicholas  using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres other lesser known assistants from his studio include   and 
algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing  in a sober but immediate  and minute attention to costume and draperies such as in the busts of  camillo pamphilj and of muzio frangipane and his two sons lello and robertohttp  wwwromeartloverit algardihtml busts of algardis children 
in temperament his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of  than to the emotive works of other baroque artists from an artistic point of view he was most successful in portrait statues and groups of children where he was obliged to follow nature most closely his terracotta models some of them finished works of art were prized by collectorsan outstanding series of terracotta models is at the

alhazen made significant contributions to optics number theory geometry astronomy and natural philosophy alhazens work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment
his main work  book of optics was known in the  mainly but not exclusively through the thirteenth century commentary by  the tanqīḥ al manāẓir li dhawī l abṣār wa l baṣāir   in  it was used by the eleventh century prince of the  of  and author of an important mathematical text  a latin translation of the kitab al manazir was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century   notes the book of optics has also been denoted as opticae thesaurus alhazen arabis as de aspectibus and also as perspectiva   this translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in catholic europe including  passim      name aves     name hendrix     name hendrix   and    his research in  the study of optical systems using mirrors centred on spherical and  mirrors and  he made the observation that the ratio between the  and  does not remain constant and investigated the  power of a  his work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as  name deek  meanwhile in the islamic world alhazens work influenced  writings on optics name topdemir 77  and his legacy was further advanced through the orming of his optics by persian scientist  died ca 1320 in the latters kitab tanqih al manazir the revision of ibn al haythams optics name bizri 2005  alhazen wrote as many as 200 books although only 55 have survived some of his treatises on optics survived only through latin translation during the middle ages his books on  were translated into latin  and other languages the crater  on the moon is named in his honourchong sm lim ach ang ps 2002 photographic atlas of the moon appendix 3 pp129   as was the    in honour of alhazen the  pakistan named its ophthalmology endowed chair as the ibn e haitham associate professor and chief of ophthalmologyhttp  wwwakuedu res office pdfs aku_research_publications_1995–1998pdf aku research publications 1995 98    alhazen by the name ibn al haytham is featured on the obverse of the iraqi 10000  banknote issued in 2003 name csmonitor  and on 10 dinar notes from 1982
one of the major scientific anniversaries that will be celebrated during the 2015  was the works on optics by ibn al haytham 1015
alhazens most famous work name khalilioptics  is his seven volume treatise on  kitab al manazir book of optics written from 1011 to 1021
optics was  by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century   it was printed by  in 1572 with the title opticae thesaurus alhazeni arabis libri septem nuncprimum editi eiusdem liber de crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus english  thesaurus of optics seven books of the arab alhazeni first edition concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds  risner is also the author of the name variant alhazen before risner he was known in the west as alhacen which is the correct transcription of the arabic name  this work enjoyed a great reputation during the  works by alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the  in  in 1834 by e a sedillot in all a mark smith has accounted for 18 full or near complete manuscripts and five fragments which are preserved in 14 locations including one in the  at  and one in the library of  
two major theories on vision prevailed in  the first theory the  was supported by such thinkers as  and  who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting  of  the second theory the intromission theory supported by  and his followers had physical forms entering the eye from an object previous islamic writers such as  had argued essentially on euclidean galenist or aristotelian lines the strongest influence on the book of optics was from ptolemys  while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on galens account  alhazens achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of euclid the medical tradition of  and the intromission theories of aristotle alhazens intromission theory followed al kindi and broke with aristotle in asserting that from each point of every colored body illuminated by any light issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point name lindberg 1976 73  this however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation in particular every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye what alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye name lindberg 1976 73  he attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly without being racted by any other part of the 
he argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board however a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off perpendicular rays were stronger than racted rays and the eye only perceive perpendicular rays as only one perpendicular ray entered the eye at any one point and all these rays converged on the centre of the eye in a cone this let resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye if only the perpendicular ray mattered then he had a one to one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved  he later asserted in book seven of the optics that other rays would be racted through the eye and perceived as if perpendicular 
his arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why only perpendicular rays were perceived why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly  his later argument that racted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive  however despite its weaknesses no other theory of the time was so comprehensive and it was enormously influential particularly in western europe directly or indirectly his de aspectibus inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries name lindberg 1976 86  s later theory of the l image which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye built directly on the conceptual framework of alhazen name lindberg 1976 86 
alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines and carried out various experiments with  s  and  name deek  he was the
first to consider separately the vertical and horizontal components of lected and racted light rays which was an important step in understanding optics geometrically 
the  was known to the  and was described by the  ic   in his scientific book  published in the year 1088 ce aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his problems however alhazens work also contained the first clear description outside of  of  in the areas of the    and  name kelley   and early analysis name wade   of the device
alhazen studied the process of sight the structure of the eye image formation in the eye and the  ian p howard argued in a 1996  article that alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to western europeans writing centuries later for example he described what became in the 19th century  he wrote a description of vertical s 600 years before  that is actually closer to the modern definition than aguiloniuss—and his work on  was repeated by panum in 1858 name howard  craig aaen stockdale while agreeing that alhazen should be credited with many advances has expressed some caution especially when considering alhazen in isolation from  who alhazen was extremely familiar with alhazen corrected a significant error of ptolemy regarding binocular vision but otherwise his account is very similar ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called herings law name aaenstockdale  in general alhazen built on and expanded the optics of ptolemy name wade 1998  name howard wade 1996  in a more detailed account of ibn al haythams contribution to the study of binocular vision based on lejeune name lejeune  and sabra name sabra  raynaud name raynaud  showed that the concepts of correspondence homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in ibn al haythams optics but contrary to howard he explained why ibn al haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why by reasoning experimentally he was in fact closer to the discovery of panums fusional area than that of the vieth müller circle in this regard ibn al haythams theory of binocular vision faced two main limits the lack of recognition of the role of the retina and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts
alhazens most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical systemgul a russell emergence of physiological optics p 691 in   his understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye name russell 689gul a russell emergence of physiological optics p 689 in   which he sought to avoid  he maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens or glacial humor as he called it were further racted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye   he followed  in believing that the  was the receptive organ of sight although some of his work hints that he thought the  was also involved 
alhazens synthesis of light and vision adhered to the aristotelian scheme exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical complete fashionhttp  wwwjstororg stable 3657357seq 104ampsearch yesampresultitemclick trueampsearchtext childampsearchtext doesampsearchuri %2faction%2fdobasicsearch%3fquery%3dchild%2bdoes%26amp%3bfilter%3diid%253a102307%252fi370516#page_scan_tab_contents de aspectibus book two 339 p437 via jstor 
an aspect associated with alhazens optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation itibararabic إعتبار and  in his scientific inquiries  moreover his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics ilm tabii with mathematics taalim geometry in particular this mathematical physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in kitab al manazir the optics de aspectibus or perspectivae and grounded his theories of vision light and colour as well as his research in catoptrics and  the study of the raction of light name bizri 2005 br        in his book ibn al haytham first scientist has argued that alhazens approach to testing and experimentation made an important contribution to the scientific method   
according to matthias schramm alhazen was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light spot formed by the projection of the  through two small  onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up name toomer 463 4  g j toomer expressed some skepticism regarding schramms view arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in alhazens very large body of work and while acknowledging alhazens importance in developing experimental techniques argued that he should not be considered in isolation from other islamic and ancient thinkers 
mark smiths critical editions of de aspectibus contain a latin glossary with page numbers of each occurrence of the words to illustrate alhazens experimental viewpoint smith shows that alhacen was received well in the west because he reinforced the importance of the hellenic tradition to them    
his work on  in book v of the book of optics contains a discussion of what is now known as alhazens problem first formulated by  in 150 ad it comprises drawing lines from two points in the  of a circle meeting at a point on the  and making equal angles with the  at that point this is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular  at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point thus its main application in optics is to solve the problem given a light source and a spherical mirror find the point on the mirror where the light will be lected to the eye of an observer this leads to an  name mactutor   this eventually led alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of s where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated his method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers although he did not himself do this perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in he used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an  where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a  name katz  alhazen eventually solved the problem using s and a geometric proof his solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in latin translation later mathematicians used  analytical methods to analyse the problem name smith  with a new solution being found in 1997 by the oxford mathematician   recently  merl researchers amit agrawal yuichi taguchi and srikumar ramalingam solved the extension of alhazens problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic parabolic and elliptical mirrors  they showed that the mirror lection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case if the camera eye is placed on the axis of the mirror the degree of the equation reduces to six name agrawaleccv10  alhazens problem can also be extended to multiple ractions from a spherical ball given a light source and a spherical ball of certain ractive index the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is racted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation name agrawaleccv10 
 has noted that alhazens treatment of raction describes an experimental setup without publication of data note 67 is on p361 333 is the summary of how to measure the sizes of the angle of raction for air to water air to glass glass to air glass to water for plane concave and convex surfaces  ptolemy published his experimental results for raction in contrast one generation before alhazen  discovered his statement of the lengths of the hypotenuse for each incident and racted right triangle respectively this is equivalent to descartes formulation for raction alhazens convention for describing the incident and racted angles is still in use his failure to publish his data is an open question
the kitab al manazir book of optics describes several experimental observations that alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies he conducted experiments with s and concluded that only the impact of  projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate whereas surfaces tended to deflect  projectile strikes for example to explain raction from a rare to a dense medium he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet a perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not name russellgul a russell emergence of physiological optics p 695 in   
he also used this result to explain how intense direct light hurts the eye using a mechanical analogy alhazen associated strong lights with perpendicular rays and weak lights with oblique ones the obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye name russell  
sudanese psychologist omar khaleefa has argued that alhazen should be considered the founder of  for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and s name khaleefa  khaleefa has also argued that alhazen should also be considered the founder of  a sub discipline and precursor to modern psychology name khaleefa  although alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed name aaenstockdale 
alhazen offered an explanation of the  an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval europeross he and plug c 2002 the mystery of the moon illusion exploring size perception oxford oxford university press  many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky a debate that is still unresolved alhazen argued against ptolemys raction theory and defined the problem in terms of perceived rather than real enlargement he said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer when the moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects so the moon appears close the perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance theore the moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky and further and larger on the horizon through works by   and witelo based on alhazens explanation the moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon with the raction theory being rejected in the 17th century  although alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation he was not the first author to offer it   2nd century gave this account in addition to raction and he credited it to   135 50 bc  ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his optics but the text is obscure  alhazens writings were more widely available in the middle ages than those of these earlier authors and that probably explains why alhazen received the credit
besides the book of optics alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject including his risala fi l daw’ treatise on light he investigated the properties of  the  s twilight and  experiments with mirrors and  provided the foundation for his theories on  name bizri 
alhazen discussed the  of the celestial region in his epitome of astronomy arguing that ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where for example none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other the suggestion of mechanical models for the earth centred  greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the ptolemaic system among the christians of the west alhazens determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important however because it meant astronomical hypotheses were accountable to the  and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms 
he also wrote maqala fi daw al qamar on the light of the moon
in his work alhazen discussed theories on the  of a body name bizri  in his treatise on place alhazen disagreed with s view that nature abhors a void and he used  in an attempt to demonstrate that place al makan is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body name bizri 2007 
    anchor for a wikilink in celestial spheres article please do not remove or rename without making the appropriate amendments to that article    
in his on the configuration of the world alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth
the book is a non technical explanation of ptolemys  which was eventually translated into  and  in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as  name britannica  during the european  and   
in his al shukūk ‛alā batlamyūs variously translated as doubts concerning ptolemy or aporias against ptolemy published at some time between 1025 and 1028 alhazen criticized s almagest planetary hypotheses and optics pointing out various contradictions he found in these works particularly in astronomy ptolemys almagest concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets whereas the hypotheses concerned what ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error but alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in ptolemys works name sabra 1998  he considered that some of the mathematical devices ptolemy introduced into astronomy especially the  failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points lines and circles 
having pointed out the problems alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in ptolemy in a later work alhazen believed there was a true configuration of the planets that ptolemy had failed to grasp he intended to complete and repair ptolemys system not to replace it completely name sabra 1998  in the doubts concerning ptolemy alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories
he held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge
alhazens the model of the motions of each of the seven planets was written  1038 only one damaged manuscript has been found with only the introduction and the first section on the theory of planetary motion surviving there was also a second section on astronomical calculation and a third section on astronomical instruments following on from his doubts on ptolemy alhazen described a new geometry based planetary model describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry he kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular which required the inclusion of  to explain observed motion but he managed to eliminate ptolemys  in general his model didnt try to provide a causal explanation of the motions but concentrated on providing a complete geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in ptolemys model name harv rashed 2007 
alhazen wrote a total of twenty five astronomical works some concerning technical issues such as exact determination of the meridian a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the  alhazen argued for a distant location based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars  the fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory including the doubts and model of the motions discussed above name rashed 2007 8–9 
in  alhazen built on the mathematical works of  and  and worked on the beginnings of the link between  and  name faruqi
 
he developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers using a geometric proof to prove the formula chapter 1 
alhazen explored what is now known as the   the fifth  in  using a   and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry   he formulated the  which boris abramovich rozenfeld names the ibn al haytham–lambert quadrilateral name rozenfeld  his theorems on s including the lambert quadrilateral were the first theorems on  and  these theorems along with his alternative postulates such as playfairs axiom can be seen as marking the beginning of  his work had a considerable influence on its development among the later persian geometers  and  and the european geometers   and  name rozenfeld youschkevitch  
in elementary geometry alhazen attempted to solve the problem of  using the area of s crescent shapes but later gave up on the impossible task name mactutor  the two lunes formed from a  by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangles sides inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides are known as the  they have the same total area as the triangle itself 
alhazens contributions to  include his work on s in his analysis and synthesis he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2supn−1 sup2supn supampnbsp−ampnbsp1 where 2supn supampnbsp−ampnbsp1 is  but he was not able to prove this result  later proved it in the 18th century name mactutor 
alhazen solved problems involving  using what is now called  in his opuscula alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences and gives two general methods of solution his first method the canonical method involved wilsons theorem while his second method involved a version of the  name mactutor 
alhazen also wrote a treatise on the influence of melodies on the souls of animals although no copies have survived it appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace
in  one account of his career as a  has him summoned to egypt by the fatimid   to regulate the  of the  river he carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual  of the nile river and he drew plans for building a  at the site of the modern day  his field work however later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme and he soon  so he could avoid punishment from the caliph pt ii p 459 
in his treatise on place alhazen disagreed with s view that nature abhors a  and he used  in an attempt to demonstrate that place al makan is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body name bizri 2007   a supporter of aristotles philosophical view of place later criticized the work in fi al radd ‘ala ibn al haytham fi al makan a utation of ibn al haytham’s place for its geometrization of place name bizri 2007 
alhazen also discussed  and its  implications in his  in tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and theore the autonomy of vision without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation sight can tell us next to nothing about such things 
alhazen was a devout  though it is uncertain which branch of  he followed he may have been either a follower of the  school of   according to  name sardar 1998  and lawrence bettany name bettany 251  and opposed to the views of the  school name bettany 251  a follower of the mutazili school of islamic theology according to peter edward hodgson name hodgson 2006 53  or a possibly follower of  according to  name referencea  
alhazen wrote a work on islamic theology in which he discussed hood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time pt ii p 464  he also wrote a treatise entitled finding the direction of qibla by calculation in which he discussed finding the  where  prayers are directed towards mathematically name topdemir 
he wrote in his doubts concerning ptolemy

alessandro di cristofano di lorenzo del bronzino allori florence 31 may 1535 – 22 september 1607 was an  portrait  of the late   school

freedberg derides allori as derivative claiming  he illustrates the ideal of maniera by which art and style are generated out of pre existing art the polish of figures has an unnatural marble like form as if he aimed for cold statuary it can be said of late phase mannerist painting in florence that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like  and  was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting while by 1600 the baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures florence was painting two dimensional statues furthermore in general with the exception of the counter maniera  artists it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion

the almoravids  imṛabḍen  al murābiṭūn were a   of g stewart is the caliph a pope in the muslim world volume 21 issue 2 pages 185–196 april 1931 the almoravid dynasty among the berbers of north africa founded a considerable empire
morocco being the result of their conquests sadiqi fatima the place of berber in morocco international journal of the sociology of language 1231 2009 7 22  the almoravids were the first relatively recent berber dynasty that ruled morocco the leaders of this dynasty came from the moroccan deep south  who formed an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western  and  founded by  their capital was  a city they founded in 1062 the dynasty originated among the  and the gudala nomadic berber tribes of the  traversing the territory between the  the  and the  riversextract from http  wwwuniversalisfr encyclopedie a912241 almoravideshtm encyclopedia universalis on almoravids 
the almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of  to the iberian christian kingdoms when they decisively defeated a coalition of the  and  armies at the  in 1086 this enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3000 kilometers north to south however the rule of the dynasty was relatively short lived the almoravids fell — at the height of their power — when they failed to quell the  led rebellion initiated by  as a result their last king  was killed in marrakesh in april 1147 by the s who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in morocco and 
the term almoravid comes from the arabic al murabitun  which is the plural form of al murabit — literally meaning one who is tying but figuratively meaning one who is ready for battle at a fortress the term is related to the notion of  a frontier monastery fortress through the root r b t  rabat to tie to unite or  raabat to encampnehemia levtzion abd allah b yasin and the almoravids in john ralph willis studies in west african islamic history  p 54 p f de moraes farias the almoravids some questions concerning the character of the movement bulletin de l’ifan series b 29 3 4 794 878 1967 
another theory states that the name almoravid comes from a school of malikite law called dar al murabitin founded in  modern day morocco by a certain scholar named https  bewleyvirtualavenet ibnyasinhtml wajjaj ibn zalwi ibn zalwi was responsible for sending his student abd allah ibn yasin to preach malikite islam to the sanhaja berbers of western sahara hence the name of the almoravids comes from the followers of the dar al murabitin the house of those who were bound together in the cause of god messier ronald a the almoravids and the meanings of jihad santa barbara ca praeger publishers 2010 
it is uncertain exactly when or why the almoravids acquired that appellation  writing in 1068 before their apex already calls them the al murabitun but does not clarify the reasons for it writing three centuries later  suggested it was chosen early on by abdallah ibn yasin  because upon finding resistance among the gudala berbers of adrar mauritania to his teaching he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ribat monastery fortress on an offshore island possibly  island in ibn abi zars account is translated in n levtzion and j f p hopkins eds 2000 corpus of early arabic sources for west african history university of ghanapp 239ff for tentative identification of the ribat see moraes farias 1967   wrote that the name was suggested by ibn yasin in the persevering in the fight sense to boost morale after a particularly hard fought battle in the  valley c 1054 in which they had taken many losses whichever explanation is true it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the almoravids for themselves partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications
the name might be related to the ribat of  in the village of aglu near present day  where the future almoravid spiritual leader abdallah ibn yasin got his initial training the 13th century moroccan biographer  and  before him in the 12th century note that waggags learning center was called dar al murabitin the house of the almoravids and that might have inspired ibn yasins choice of name for the movement  
contemporaries frequently erred to them as the al mulathimun the veiled ones from litham  for veil the almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes see  a custom they adapted from southern  berbers this can still be seen among the modern  but it was unusual further north although practical for the desert dust the almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere as a badge of foreignness in urban settings partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials it served as the uniform of the almoravids  under their rule s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class in turn the succeeding  made a point of mocking the almoravid veil as symbolic of  and decadence
the s of the  in the early middle ages could be roughly classified into three major groups the  across the north the  concentrated in central morocco and the  clustered in two areas the western part of the  and the hills of the eastern maghreb  mones 1988 p 119 1992 p 228  the eastern sanhaja included the  berbers who had been the base of the  rise in the early 10th century and the  who ruled  as vassals of the fatimids after the latter moved to egypt in 972 the western sanhaja were divided into several tribes the gazzula and the  in the  and the foothills of the  range further south encamped in the western  were the massufa the  and the banu warith and most southerly of all the gudala or judala in littoral  down to the borderlands of the 
the western sanhaja had been converted to  some time in the 9th century they were subsequently united in the 10th century and with the zeal of neophyte converts launched several campaigns against the ese pagan peoples of lewicki 1988 pp 160 61 1992 pp 308 09  under their king tinbarutan ibn usfayshar the sanhaja lamtuna erected or captured the citadel of  a critical stop on the  route after the collapse of the sanhaja union awdagust passed over to the  and the trans saharan routes were taken over by the   of  the maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the sanhaja gazzula and lamta out of their pasturelands in the sous and draa valleys around 1035 the lamtuna chieftain abu abdallah muhammad ibn tifat alias tarsina tried to reunite the sanhaja desert tribes but his reign lasted less than three years
around 1040  a chieftain of the gudala and brother in law of the late tarsina went on  to  on his return he stopped by  in  where he met  a native of  and a jurist and scholar of the   school at this time ifriqiya was in ferment the  ruler  was openly contemplating breaking with his   overlords in cairo and the jurists of kairouan were agitating for him to do so within this heady atmosphere yahya and abu imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands and yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of  among his southern sanhaja people with abu imrans recommendation yahya ibn ibrahim made his way to the ribat of waggag ibn zelu in the  valley of southern morocco to seek out a maliki teacher for his people waggag assigned him one of his residents 
abdallah ibn yasin was a gazzula berber and probably a convert rather than a born muslim his name can be read as son of  the title of the 36th  of the  suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was re born of the holy bookm brett and e fentress 1996 the berbers oxford blackwell p 100 revealingly the 36th sura begins the salutation you are one of messengers and the imperative duty to set people on the straight path ibn yasins choice of name was probably not a coincidence  ibn yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the  and the  name shilling88   chroniclers such as al bakri allege ibn yasins learning was superficial ibn yasins initial meetings with the gudala people went poorly as he had more ardor than depth ibn yasins arguments were disputed by his audience he responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations the gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector yahya ibn ibrahim sometime in the 1040s
ibn yasin however found a more favorable reception among the neighboring lamtuna people name shilling88  probably sensing the useful organizing power of ibn yasins pious fervor the lamtuna chieftain  invited the man to preach to his people the lamtuna leaders however kept ibn yasin on a caul leash forging a more productive partnership between them invoking stories of the early life of muhammad ibn yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to islamicization that it was not enough to merely adhere to gods law but necessary to also destroy opposition to it in ibn yasins ideology anything and everything outside of islamic law could be characterized as opposition he identified tribalism in particular as an obstacle he believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences and embrace the equality of all muslims under the sacred law it was necessary to make them do so for the lamtuna leadership this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to ound the sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions in the early 1050s the lamtuna under the joint leadership of yahya ibn umar and abdallah ibn yasin — soon calling themselves the al murabitin almoravids — set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause
from the year 1053 the almoravids began to spread their religious way to the berber areas of the sahara and to the regions south of the desert after winning over the  berber tribe they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route seizing  at the northern end in 1054 and  at the southern end in 1055 yahya ibn umar was killed in a battle in 1057 name shilling90shillington p 90  but abdullah ibn yasin whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount named his brother  as chief under him the almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert and conquered the tribes of the  they then came in contact with the  a berber tribal confederation who followed a heresy founded by  three centuries earlier the berghouata resisted and it was in battle with them that abdullah ibn yasin was killed in 1059 in a village called krifla located near  morocco they were however completely conquered by  and adopted islam as a religion abu bakr married a noble and wealthy berber woman  who  would become very influential in the development of the dynasty name zar87  zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from houara who is said to be from  in origin name zar87 
in 1061  made a division of the power he had established handing over the more settled parts to his cousin  as  and also assigning to him his favourite wife zaynab  ibn umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert when he returned to resume control he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded in november 1087 name zar89  abu bakr was killed in battle by a poisoned arrow while fighting in the historic region of the  name zar89 
yusuf ibn tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as morocco  and  into complete subjection in 1062 he founded the city of  in 1080 he conquered the kingdom of  in modern day  and founded the present city of that name his rule extending as far east as  name br1911 
according to arab tradition the almoravids conquered the  sometime around 1075 cemuslim societies in african history new approaches to african history david robinson  which example was displayed by the record of historian  through the  of ghana shaykh uthman in 1394 that almoravid movement weakened ghana to the extent that the authority of the rulers of ghana dwindled away and they were overcome by the  a neighboring people of the sudan who subjugated and absorbed themibn khaldun in levtzion and hopkins eds and transl corpus p 333   traditions in mali related that the soso attacked and took over mali as well and the ruler of the soso sumaouro kanté took over the landnehemia levtzion ancient ghana and mali new york 1973 pp 51 2 58 60 
however criticism from conrad and fisher 1982 argued that the notion of any almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on arabic sources furthermore according to the archaeology research from professor timothy insoll of ancient ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any almoravid era military conquests
dierke lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesnt preclude almoravid political agitation claiming that the main factor of the demise of ghana empire owed much to the latter according to lange the almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife there the almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nations nobility scholars such as dierk lange attribute the decline of ancient ghana to numerous unrelated factors only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by almoravid influence and islamic pressures but devoid of any military conversion and conquestlange dierk 1996 the almoravid expansion and the downfall of ghana der islam 73 pp 122 59 
this interpretation of events was disputed by later scholars like sheril burkhalater who argued that whatever the nature of the conquest in the south the influence and success of the almoravids in securing west africa gold  and curcylating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control the ensuing war pushed ghana over the edge ending the kingdoms position as a commercial and military power by 1100 it collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies some of which later assimilated into the almoravids while others founded the  sheryl burkhalter suggests that the almoravid who led the expedition to conquer ghana was none other abu bakr’s son yahyalistening for silences in almoravid history another reading of “the conquest thatnever was”  sheryl l burkhalter

he returned to iberia in 1090 avowedly for the purpose of annexing the taifa principalities of iberia he was supported by most of the iberian people who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers their religious teachers as well as others in the east most notably  in  and  in egypt who was himself an iberian by birth from  detested the taifa rulers for their religious indifference the clerics issued a  a non binding legal opinion that yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers whom he saw as heterodox in their faith by 1094 yusuf had annexed most of the major taifas with the exception of the one at  the almoravids were victorious at the  during which the son of el cid diego rodríguez perished alfonso with some leónese retreated into the castle of consuegra which was besieged for eight days until the almoravids withdrew to the south

the age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be  to consent to  and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity the distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner as the offender
the term age of consent rarely actually appears in legal s name waites  it has sometimes been used with other meanings such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to oxford english dictionary entry for age of consent  but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood it should not be confused with the   the  the  the  etc
age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction name waites   though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18 the laws may also vary by the type of sexual act the gender of the participants or other restrictions such as abuse of a  some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other rather than a single age charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a  such as corruption of a minor to what is popularly called  which is considered equivalent to  both in severity and sentencing
there are many grey areas in this area of law some regarding unspecific and untried legislation others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes and others due to conflicts between  and  laws these factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject and a topic of highly charged debates name waites  
in traditional societies the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide or a tribal custom in most cases this coincided with signs of   for a woman and pubic hair for a man name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent  the ancient greek poet  in  c 700 bc suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty
reliable data for when people would actually marry is difficult to find in england for example the only reliable data on age at marriage in the early modern period comes from records involving those who left property after their death not only were the records relatively rare but not all bothered to record the participants ages and it seems that the more complete the records are the more likely they are to reveal young marriages additionally 20th  and 21st century historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept data regarding young ages of marriage and instead explain the data away as a misreading by a later copier of the records name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent 
in the 12th century  the influential founder of  in  europe accepted age of puberty for marriage to be between 12 and 14 but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than 7  there were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty or if they had already consummated the marriage it should be noted that judges honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger thanampnbsp7 in spite of what gratian had said there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent 
the first recorded age of consent law dates from 1275 in england as part of the  law a statute westminster 1 made it a misdemeanor to ravish a maiden within age whether with or without her consent the phrase within age was interpreted by jurist sir edward coke as meaning the age of marriage which at the time was 12 years of age name stephen robertson university of sydney australia 
the american colonies followed the english tradition and the law was more of a guide for example mary hathaway virginia 1689 was only 9 when she was married to william williams sir edward coke england 17th century made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a  from her husbands estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old name encyclopedia of children and childhood in history and society a ar age of consent 
in the 16th century a small number of italian and german states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls setting it at 12 years towards the end of the 18th century other european countries also began to enact similar laws the first french constitution of 1791 established the minimum age at 11 years portugal spain denmark and the swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at 10–12 years name chnmgmuedu 
age of consent laws were historically difficult to follow and enforce legal norms based on age were not in general common until the 19th century because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable name chnmgmuedu 
in  societies  was forbidden however older children were often punished themselves as being complicit in the sexual interaction with the adult until the late 18th century there was little understanding of  as a concept and children were often seen as little adults indeed prior to the 12th century there was virtually no notion of childhood at all christianity also deemed that children were born into the  and as such were perceived as inherently immoral name autogenerated1  children had very few rights and were considered the  of the father  high rates of  also meant that parents emotionally distanced themselves from their children name zelizer2010  from the late 18th century and especially in the 19th century attitudes started to change by the mid 19th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse name autogenerated1 
a general great shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex took place in the modern era and beliefs on the appropriate age below which girls should not be permitted to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood while ages from 10 to 13 were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in  during the mid 19th century name waites   by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent name stephen robertson university of sydney australia 
the english  had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of 10 to 12 but in 1875 the age was raised to 13 after intense sensational media revelations about the scourge of under age prostitution in london in the 1880s caused respectable middle class outrage the age of consent was raised to 16 in 1885 early feminists of the social purity movement such as  and others instrumental in securing the repeal of the  began to turn towards the problem of  by the end of the 1870s
the investigative journalist  of the  was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the london underworld through a publicity stunt in 1885 he purchased one victim  the 13 year old daughter of a  for £5 and took her to a brothel where she was drugged he then published a series of four exposés entitled  which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction procurement and sale of young english virgins to continental pleasure palaces the maiden tribute was an instant hit with the public victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution fearing riots on a national scale the   pleaded in vain with stead to cease publication of the articles a wide variety of orm groups held protest meetings and marched together to  demanding that the age of consent be raised the government was forced to pass the  that raised the age of consent to 16 and clamped down on prostitution 
in the united states as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at 10–12 in delaware it wasampnbsp7 in 1895  inspired by the maiden tribute female ormers in the us initiated their own campaigndelinquent daughters policing and protecting adolescent female sexuality in the united states 1885 1920 by mary odem chapel hill university of north carolina press 1995 isbn 978 0807863671  which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at leastampnbsp16 with the ultimate goal to raise the age to 18 the campaign was successful with almost all states raising the minimum age to 16–18 years by 1920 name stephen robertson university of sydney australia   
in  portugal denmark and the swiss cantons and other countries the minimum age was raised to between 13 and 16 years in the following decades name stephen robertson university of sydney australia  though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality since then the raison dêtre of the laws has changed to  and a so called right to childhood or innocencethe emergence of a new taboo the desexualization of youth in western societies since 1800 by martin killias european journal on criminal policy and research vol8 2000 issn 0928 1371 
in france under the  the age of consent was set in 1832 at 11  and was raised to 13 in 1863  it was increased to 15 in 1945 
in  it was set in 1822 at puberty age and changed to 12 in 1870  which was kept until 1999 when it became 13   and in 2015 it was raised to 16   
in the 21st century concerns about  and  of children gained international prominence and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions as well as in the adoption of several international instruments
the    25 october 2007 and the s directive 2011 92 eu of the european parliament and of the council of 13 december 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography  were adopted
the  came into force in 2002
the  which came into force in 2003 prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children 
the  which came into force in 2008 also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children
several western countries have raised their ages of consent recently these include  in 2008   from 14 to 16 and in europe  in 2007   from 14 to 15  in 2010   from 14 to 16  in 2013   from 14 to 15 and  in 2015   from 13 to 16
the international criminal court statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape sexual violence statute but makes erence to sexual acts committed against persons incapable of giving genuine consent and the explicative footnote states it is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural induced or age related incapacity see note 51 
sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a  in most countries jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense including   illegal  corruption of a minor name waites   besides others
the enforcement practices of age of consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture see above often enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor eg a teacher minister or doctor the  of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individuals guilt and theore enforcement name waites  
the threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions  most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent name soa2003  however some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after their  such as the state of  in  and  but only in marriage ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used such as the   how  in  are handled or even the method by which  date is calculated 
the age of consent is a legal barrier to the minors ability to consent and theore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age for example
 reasonable belief that the victim is over the age of consent in some jurisdictions such as  name soa2003  it is a defense if the accused can show that he or she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of consent however where such a defense is provided it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show  in determining the age of the victim eg a 15 year old who used a fake identification document claiming to be 18 or older 
 marriage in most jurisdictions age of consent laws do not apply if the parties are legally married to each other
  some jurisdictions have laws explicitly allowing sexual acts with minors under the age of consent if their partner is close in age to them for instance in  the age of consent is 16 but there are two close in age exemptions sex with minors aged 14–15 is permitted if the partner is less than five years older and sex with minors aged 12–13 is permitted if the partner is less than two years older  other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of a similar age and development for instance the age of consent in  is 16 but the law states that the act will not be punished if there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved  another approach takes the form of a stipulation that sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed a certain age for example the age of consent in the us state of  is 18 but it is allowed for teenagers aged 16 and 17 to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than 30  in  the age of consent in 15 but the law requires that there is a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim 
 homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies some jurisdictions such as     and  have a higher age of consent for  sexual activity in both the united kingdom and western australia for example the age of consent was originally 21 for same sex sexual activity between males with no laws regarding  sexual activities while it was 16 for  sexual activity this is no longer the casethe causes and cures of criminality eysenck hans 1989 plenum press new york page 229  however such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged in both  and the n state of  the age of consent for  is officially higher at 18 years compared with 16 years for vaginal and oral sex name can  name aust  in the canadian provinces of   and  this discrepancy has been declared unconstitutional by courts  
 gender age differentials in some jurisdictions such as  name indonesia  there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity that are based on the gender of each person in countries where there are gender age differentials the age of consent may be higher for girls—for example in  where the age of consent for heterosexual sex is 16 for girls and 14 for boys  or they may be higher for males such as in indonesia where males must be 19 years old and females must be 16 years old name indonesia   there are also numerous jurisdictions—such as kuwait name kuwait  and  name palestine —in which  govern the gender age differential in these jurisdictions it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage so the de facto age of consent is the marriageable age in kuwait this means that boys must be at least 17 and girls at least 15 years old
 position of authority trust in most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below 18 such as england and wales name soa2003_a  in cases where a person aged 18 or older is in a position of trust over a person under 18 the age of consent usually rises to 18 or higher examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students for example in england and wales the age of consent is 16 but if the person is a student of the older person it becomesampnbsp18
some countries have age of consent laws which apply not only to acts committed within the country but also to those committed by its citizens or inhabitants while they are on foreign soil name waites   for example a federal united states law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with us citizens from another state if the partner is under 18 and the activity is illegal under the federal state or local law this applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the united states or from one state into another for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter  name solr 
there is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter in law or in practice traditionally age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls name chnmgmuedu  many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender rather than dealing with concerns of chastity this has led to gender neutral laws in many jurisdictions name chnmgmuedu  on the other hand there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an unequal act for males and females due to issues such as pregnancy increased risk of stdsunfpa writes that biologically womens risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of menhttp  wwwunfpaorg resources giving special attention girls and adolescents  and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready in the us in  it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because the equal protection clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded 
traditionally many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys the latter acts often falling under  and  laws this means that in some legal systems women having sexual contact with underage youth were rarely acknowledged for example until 2000 in the uk before the  there was no statutory age of consent for  sex  in  before 2005 there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boysin respect of sexual conduct with a young person aged under 16 the bill crimes amendment bill no 2 which became law in 2005 http  wwwparliamentnz en nz pb legislation bills 00dbhoh_bill5923_1 crimes amendment bill no 2 significantly toughens the law the loophole protecting women against being charged with sexual offending against children is removedhttp  wwwparliamentnz en nz pb debates debates 47hansd_20050414_00000206 crimes amendment bill no 2 %e2%80%94 second reading instruction  situations like these have been attributed to societal views on traditional  and to constructs of  and  according to e martellozzo viewing females as perpetrators of sexual abuse goes against every stereotype that society has of women women as mothers and caregivers and not as people who abuse and harm   argues that women are not acknowledged as perpetrators of sex crimes because society does not accept that women have an autonomous sexuality of their own

amalric of bena   died  1204 1207 ad was a   and  leader after whom the  are named
amalric was born in the latter part of the 12th century at bennes a village between  and  in the 
amalric taught philosophy and theology at the  and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle ian his lectures developing the  attracted a large circle of hearers  in 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university and on a personal appeal to  the sentence was ratified amalric being ordered to return to paris and recant his errors
his death was caused it is said by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected
in 1209 ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of paris and amalrics own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds  the doctrines of his followers known as the s were formally condemned by the  in 1215
amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from  whose principles he developed in a one sided and strongly ic form
three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him
#that god is all omnia sunt deus and thus all things are one because whatever is is god omnia unum quia quidquid est est deus
#that every christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of christ and that this belief is necessary for salvation
#that he who remains in love of god can commit no sin
because of the first proposition god himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation
these three propositions were further developed by his followers who maintained that god revealed himself in a threefold revelation the first in the biblical patriarch  marking the epoch of the father the second in  who began the epoch of the son and the third in amalric and his disciples who inaugurated the era of the 
amalricians taught
hell is ignorance theore hell is within all men like a bad tooth in a mouth
god is identical with all that is even evil belongs to god and proves gods omnipotence
a man who knows that god works through everything cannot sin because every human act is then the act of god
a man who recognizes the truth that god works through everything is already in heaven and this is the only resurrection  there is no other life mans fulfilment is in this life alone
due to persecutions this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder not long after the burning of ten of their members 1210 the sect itself lost its importance while some of the surviving amalricians became http  wwwpinselparkorg geschichte einzel p0375_mittelalter r_haeresiehtml german

the portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between galicia and portugal and rallied around the infant afonso  the archbishop of braga was also concerned with the dominance of galicia apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the galician archbishop of santiago de compostela diego gelmírez who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of saint james in his town as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the iberian peninsula in 1122 afonso turned fourteen the adult age in the 12th century he made himself a  on his own account in the  raised an army and proceeded to take control of his mothers lands

afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the moors in the south his campaigns were successful and on 25 july 1139 he obtained an overwhelming victory in the  and straight after was unanimously proclaimed king of the portuguese by his soldiers establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the peninsula the first assembly of the estates general convened at  wherein he would have been given the crown from the archbishop of braga to confirm his independence is a 17th century embellishment of portuguese history
independence from alfonso vii of leóns  however was not a thing he just could achieve militarily the county of portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and most importantly by the  and the  afonso wed  daughter of  and sent ambassadors to rome to negotiate with the pope he succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin alfonso vii of león becoming instead a vassal of the papacy as the kings of sicily and aragon had done before him in 1179 the bull  accepted the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively
in portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders he is notably the builder of  to which he called the  of his uncle  of  in 1143 he wrote to  to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church swearing to pursue driving the moors out of the iberian peninsula bypassing any king of león afonso declared himself the direct  of the papacy afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the moors from whom he wrested  see  and  in 1147 see  he also conquered an important part of the land south of the  river although this was lost again to the moors in the following years
meanwhile king alfonso vii of león afonsos cousin regarded the independent ruler of portugal as nothing but a rebel conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years afonso became involved in a war taking the side of the aragonese king an enemy of castile to ensure the alliance his son  was engaged to  sister of the  and infanta of aragon finally after winning the  the  established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the kingdom of león that portugal was a sovereign kingdom

as a king afonso ii set a different approach of government hitherto his father sancho i and his grandfather  were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring  or against the  lands in the south afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with castile during his reign despite this some towns like  in 1217 were conquered from the moors by the private initiative of noblemen this does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man the first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between afonso and his brothers and sisters the king managed to keep security within portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin
since military issues were not a government priority afonso established the states administration and centralized power on himself he designed the first set of portuguese written laws these were mainly concerned with  civil justice and  afonso also sent ambassadors to european kingdoms outside the  and began amicable commercial relations with most of them
other orms included the always delicate matters with the pope in order to get the independence of portugal recognized by rome his grandfather afonso i had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the church these eventually created a state within the state with portugals position as a country firmly established afonso ii endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the  to purposes of national utility these actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and portugal after being  for his audacities by  afonso ii promised to make amends to the church but he died in 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so

confronted with heavy fire alfonso ii reached out to s franks he sent delegations to  and  in 796 797 and 798 these diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of asturias against ongoing internal unrest——troubles in galicia——and external attacks of the ibn mugait brothers ie generals abd al karim and abd al malik
alfonso was acknowledged as a king by charlemagne and the pope and asturias as a kingdom for the first time the king showed an interest in the frankish cult of saint martin of tours and most notably he encouraged carolingian church influence into asturias not surprisingly during alfonsos reign the alleged resting place of st james was revealed alfonsos envoys to charlemagnes courts may have also dealt with the  controversy which had brought bermudos kingdom into charlemagnes view it seems that carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into andalusian territory up to  the andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798

alfonso xii alfonso francisco de asís fernando pío juan maría de la concepción gregorio pelayo 28 november 1857 – 25 november 1885 was  reigning from 1874 to 1885 after a coup détat restored the monarchy and ended the ephemeral 
having been forced into exile after the  deposed his mother  from the throne in 1868 alfonso studied in  and  his mother abdicated in his favour in 1870 and he returned to spain as king in 1874 following a military coup alfonso died aged 27 in 1885 and was succeeded by his unborn son who became  on his birth the following year
alfonso was born in  as the eldest son of  officially his father was her husband  alfonsos biological paternity is uncertain there is speculation that his biological father may have been enrique puigmoltó y mayans a captain of the guardjuan sisinio pérez garzón isabel ii los espejos de la reina 2004  these rumours were used as political propaganda against alfonso by the 
his mothers accession created the second cause of instability which was the carlist wars the supporters of the  as king of spain rose to have him enthroned in addition within the context of the post napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the west both in europe and the americas both the carlistas as well as the isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new napoleonic constitutional system much like in britain which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the traditional spanish organic laws such as the  the novísima recopilación and the  this led to the third cause of instability of note the independence of the american kingdoms recognized between 1823 and 1850
when queen isabella and her husband were forced to leave spain by the  alfonso accompanied them to paris from there he was sent to the  at  to continue his studies on 25 june 1870 he was recalled to paris where his mother abdicated in his favour in the presence of a number of spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen he assumed the title of alfonso xii for although no king of united spain had borne the name alfonso xi the spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of   and  also named 
after amadeos abandonment in 1873 parliament declared the federal republic including cuba puerto rico and the pacific archipelagos the first act of president estanislao figueras was to extend the abolition act to puerto rico cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889
but the republicans were not in agreement either and they had to contend with the war in cuba and muslim uprisings in spanish morocco in the midst of the crisis during and after the first spanish republic the  party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity such as catalonia or the basque districts by 1872 the  erupted this unrest led to the creation of a group in favor of the bourbon restoration made by some sectors of the conservatives led by canovas del castillo
the prince of asturias alfonso was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by canovas which led to the june 1870 abdication of queen isabel ii in favour of her son prince alfonso the new road map which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called alfonsismo and the moderate centrist cánovas del castillo became the spokesman as having alfonso in spain would be a problem  cánovas became responsible for his education so he sent alfonso to the sandhurst military academy in england where the training alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than spain given the current atmosphere
on 1 december 1874 alfonso issued the sandhurst manifesto where he set the ideological basis of the bourbon restoration  it was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the spanish monarchy at the end of 1874 brigadier  who had long been working more or less openly for the king led some battalions of the central army to  rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him and entered  in the kings name thereupon the president resigned and his power was transferred to the kings plenipotentiary and adviser  the 29 december 1874 military coup of gen martinez campos in sagunto ended the failed republic and  meant the rise of the young prince alfonso
within a few days after canovas del castillo took power as premier the new king proclaimed on 29 december 1874 arrived at madrid passing through  and  and was acclaimed everywhere 1875 in 1876 a vigorous campaign against the  in which the young king took part resulted in the defeat of  and the dukes abandonment of the struggle
initially led by canovas del castillo as moderate prime minister what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political administrative positions of power in reality ushered in a permanent civilian regime that lasted until the 1931 second republic  cánovas was the real architect of the new regime of the restoration
in order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of isabel ii the single party and its destabilizing consequences the liberal party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics and the turnismo or alternation was to become the new system turnismo would be endorsed in the constitution of 1876 and the pact of pardo palace 1885 it meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles
this led to the end of the carlist revolts and the victory over the new york backed cuban revolutionaries and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular spaniards of alfonso as a wise and able king
alfonsos short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of spain after the 1808–1874 crisis both european the coastal regions such as the basque country catalonia and asturias and overseas – antilles and pacific were able to grow steadily cuba and puerto rico prospered to the point that spains first train was between havana and camaguey and the worlds first telegraph was in puerto rico as samuel morse lived there with his daughter married to a puerto rican businessman upon the american invasion of puerto rico ten us dollars were needed to buy one puerto rican peso
on 23 january 1878 at the basilica of  in madrid alfonso married his first cousin princess  daughter of  but she died within six months of the marriage
on 29 november 1879 at the basilica of atocha in  alfonso married a much more distant relative  daughter of  and  during the honeymoon a pastry cook named otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in madrid

his earliest years were passed in the  learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of lope garcés the pilgrim who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of  when alfonso came to the throne
during his brothers reign he participated in the taking of huesca the  1096 which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital  he also joined s expeditions in   his father gave him the lordships of    and 
a series of deaths put alfonso directly in line for the throne  his brothers children isabella and peter who married maría rodríguez daughter of  died in 1103 and 1104 respectively
a passionate fighting man he fought twenty nine battles against christian or moor he was married  when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor in 1109 to the ambitious queen  widow of  a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role  the marriage had been arranged by her father  in 1106 to unite the two chief christian states against the  and to supply them with a capable military leader  but urraca was tenacious of her right as  and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war even placing urraca under siege at astorga in 1112bernard f reilly the contest of christian and muslim spain 1031 1157 blackwell 1995 133 134  alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the  and the  but his only trustworthy supporters were his aragonese who were not numerous enough to keep  and  subjugated the marriage of alfonso and urraca was declared null by the pope as they were second cousins in 1110 but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with urraca until 1114 during his marriage he had called himself king and emperor of castile toledo aragón pamplona sobrarbe and ribagorza in recognition of his rights as urracas husband of his inheritance of the lands of his father including the kingdom of his great uncle  and his prerogative to conquer  from the muslims  he inserted the title of imperator on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule
alfonsos late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women ibn al athir 1166–1234 describes alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover who responded when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of muslim chiefs responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not womenquoted in lourie 1975639 note no bastards are recorded though they would have cut prominent figures under the circumstances no inference of homosexuality need be drawn the chastity that supports fitness for the hunt or for battle is a cultural  as old as the myth of  
the king quarrelled with the church and particularly the s almost as violently as with his wife  as he defeated her so he drove  into exile and expelled the monks of  he was finally compelled to give way in castile and león to his stepson  son of urraca and her first husband  the intervention of  brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake
in 1122 in belchite he founded  to fight against the almoravids  it was the start of the military orders in aragon  years later he organised a branch of the militia christi of the  at 
alfonso spent his first four years in near constant war with the muslims  in 1105 he conquered ejea and tauste and ortified castellar and juslibol  in 1106 he defeated  of zaragoza at valtierra  in 1107 he took tamarite de litera and esteban de la litera  then followed a period dominated by his relations with castile and león through his wife urraca  he resumed his conquest in 1117 by conquering      and 
in 1118 the council of toulouse declared a  to assist in the conquest of   many frenchmen consequently joined alfonso at   they took almudévar gurrea de gállego and zuera besieging zaragoza itself by the end of may the city fell on 18 december and the forces of alfonso occupied the azuda the government tower  the great palace of the city was given to the monks of bernard  promptly the city was made alfonsos capital  two years later in 1120 he defeated a muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the  he promulgated the fuero of tortum per tortum facilitating taking the law into ones own hands which among others reassumed the muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs
in 1119 he retook cervera tudejen castellón tarazona Ágreda magallón borja alagón novillas mallén rueda Épila and populated the region of   he began the siege of  but left to defeat the army at cutanda trying to retake zaragoza  when calatayud fell he took bubierca alhama de aragón ariza and daroca 1120  in 1123 he besieged and took  which was in the hands of the   from the winter of 1124 to september 1125 he was on a risky expedition to peña cadiella deep in andalusia
in the great raid of 1125 he carried away a large part of the subject christians from granada and in the south west of france he had claims as usurper king of navarre  from 1125 to 1126 he was on campaign against  where he was trying to install a christian prince and  where got only as far as motril  in 1127 he reconquered longares but simultaneously lost all his castilian possessions to   he confirmed a treaty with castile the next year 1128 with the  which fixed the boundaries of the two realms
he conquered molina de aragón and populated  in 1129 before besieging  which had fallen again upon the cids death
he went north of the pyrenees in october 1130 to protect the   early in 1131 he besieged   it is said he ruled from belorado to pallars and from bayonne to monreal
at the  in october 1131 three years before his death he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in palestine and politically largely independent   the  the  and the knights of the    whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out the will has greatly puzzled historians who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of alfonsos character one that effectively undid his lifes work elena lourie 1975 suggested instead that it was alfonsos attempt to neutralize the papacys interest in a disputed succession — aragon had been a fief of the papacy since 1068 — and to fend off urracas son from her first marriage alfonso vii of castile for the papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament indeed did write alfonso vii to just this effect 10 june 1135 or 36 lourie 1995645  generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on alfonso viis ambitions to break it — and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric in the event it was a will that his nobles used to carry out — instead bringing his brother ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers — an eventuality that lourie suggests was alfonsos hidden intent
his final campaigns were against mequinenza 1133 and fraga 1134 where  the future king of navarre and a mere 500 other knights fought with him  it fell on 17 july he was dead by september his tomb is in the  in 
the testament of alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms and possible successors were sought  alfonsos only brother  had been a  monk since childhood and his commitment to the church his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession the step son of the deceased king  as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of  put himself forward but garnered no local support  the nobility of navarre aligned behind  the grandson of alfonsos illegitimate uncle while the aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot bishop ramiro  a convention was called at  to develop a consensus but there peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him yet were unwilling to accept ramiro  the convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently

   do not add images of amaryllis the ornamental south american flower which is genus hippesstrum not amaryllis    
amaryllis brenzel kn ed 2001 sunset western garden book menlo park sunset publishing pp 606–607  is a small  of flowering s with two species the better known of the two amaryllis belladonna is a  of the  region of  particularly the rocky southwest area between the  valley to  name biodiveristyexp  for many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names amaryllis and hippeastrum one result of which is that the common name amaryllis is mainly used for s of the genus  widely sold in the winter months for their ability to  indoors plants of the genus amaryllis are known as belladonna lily jersey lily naked lady amarillo easter lily in southern  or in south africa march lily due to its propensity to flower around march this is one of numerous genera with the common name lily due to their flower shape and growth habit however they are only distantly related to the true lily 
amaryllis is a ous plant with each bulb being  in diameter it has several strap shaped green   long and  broad arranged in two rows
each bulb produces one or two leafless stems 30–60ampnbspcm tall each of which bears a cluster of two to twelve funnel shaped s at their tops each flower is  diameter with six s three outer sepals three inner petals with similar appearance to each other the usual color is white with crimson veins but pink or purple also occur naturally
the name amaryllis is taken from a shepherdess in s pastoral  from the    meaning to sparkle  and also from amarella for the bitterness of the bulb linné carl von 1737 hortus cliffortianus p 135 
the taxonomy of the genus has been controversial in 1753  created the name amaryllis belladonna the  of the genus amaryllis at the time both south african and south american plants were placed in the same genus subsequently they were separated into two different genera the key question is whether linnaeuss type was a south african plant or a south american plant if the latter amaryllis would be the correct name for the genus  and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here  et al have briefly summarized the debate which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the  the outcome was a decision by the 14th international botanical congress in 1987 that amaryllis smalll small should be a conserved name ie correct regardless of priority and ultimately based on a specimen of the south african  from the clifford herbarium at the british museum 
although the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus the common name amaryllis continues to be used differently bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as ready to bloom for the holidays belong to the allied genus eg   the common name naked lady used for amaryllis is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names such as the resurrection lily  the common name naked lady comes from the plants pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down
in areas of its native habitat with mountainous  flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth  in more open sandy areas of the western cape the plant flowers annually name biodiveristyexp   plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds large size and heavy weight  strong winds shake loose the seeds which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate aided by the first winter rains name biodiveristyexp  
the leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring the bulb is then dormant until late summer the plant is not frost tolerant nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production
one or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer march in its native habitat and august in 
the plant has a  relationship with   it is also visited by  at night   the relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established name biodiveristyexp   however carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the  the plants main parasite is the lily borer name plantz   and or 
amaryllis belladonna was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century it reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the west coast of the usa since these environments mimic their native south african habitat hardiness zones 6 8http  wwwcesncsuedu depts hort consumer factsheets bulbs summer amar_bellahtml north carolina state university  it is also naturalized in australia name apni 
there is an amaryllis belladonna hybrid which was bred in the 1800s in australia no one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white cream peach magenta and nearly red hues the hybrids were crossed back onto the original amaryllis belladonna and with each other to produce naturally seed bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes shapes stem heights and intensities of pink pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well the hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes veining darkened edges white centers and light yellow centers also setting them apart from the original light pink in addition the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the side facing habit of the old fashioned pink the hybrids are able to adapt to year round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be

amaryllis belladonna has been crossed in cultivation with  to produce a hybrid called   which has named cultivars hybrids said to be between amaryllis belladonna and  have been called ×ampnbspamarygia  neither hybrid genus name is accepted by the world checklist of selected plant families search for amarcrinum and amarygia

amasis ii  or ahmose ii was a  reigned 570 bce – 526 bce of the  the successor of  at  he was the last great ruler of  before the  conquest name ocd 
most of our information about him is derived from  2161ff and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence according to the greek historian he was of common origins name dgrbm  he was originally an  in the egyptian army his birthplace was siuph at  already he took part in a general campaign of pharaoh  in 592 bc in 
a revolt which broke out among native egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne these troops returning home from a disastrous military expedition to  in libya suspected that they had been betrayed in order that  the reigning king might rule more absolutely by means of his greek  many egyptians fully sympathized with them general amasis sent to meet them and quell the revolt was proclaimed king by the rebels instead and apries who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries was defeated apries fled to the babylonians and was killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 bce with the aid of a babylonian army an inscription confirms the struggle between the native egyptian and the foreign soldiery and proves that apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of amasis c 567 bce amasis then married chedebnitjerbone ii one of the daughters of his predecessor  in order to legitimise his kingship  dodson places her as the wife of nakhthorheb  
some information is known about the family origins of amasis his mother was a certain tashereniset as a bust statue of this lady which is today located in the british museum showsaidan dodson amp dyan hilton the complete royal families of ancient egypt thames amp hudson 2004 pp245 amp 247  a stone block from mehallet el kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother—tasherenisets mother—was a certain tjenmutetjdodson amp hilton pp245 amp 247 
his court is relatively well known the head of the gate guard ahmose sa neith appears on numerous monuments including the location of his sarcophagus  he was called on monuments of the 30th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time  wahibre was leader of the southern foreigners and head of the doors of foreigners so he was the highest official for border security under amasis the career of doctors udjahorresnet began who was then under the persians of particular importance several heads of the fleet are known psamtek meryneit and pasherientaihet   padineith are the only occupied viziers
 describes how amasis ii would eventually cause a confrontation with the persian armies according to herodotus amasis was asked by  or  for an egyptian  on good terms amasis seems to have complied by forcing an egyptian physician into mandatory labor causing him to leave his family behind in egypt and move to persia in forced exile in an attempt to exact revenge for his forced exile the physician would grow very close to cambyses and would suggest that cambyses should ask amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the egyptians cambyses complied and requested a daughter of amasis for marriage name hero 
amasis worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the persian king used to give up his offspring amasis also was not willing to take on the persian empire so he concocted a trickery in which he forced the daughter of the ex pharaoh  whom herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by amasis to go to persia instead of his own offspring name hero  name sir  name herodotus 
this daughter of apries was none other than  who was as per herodotuss account tall and beautiful nitetis naturally betrayed amasis and upon being greeted by the persian king explained amasiss trickery and her true origins this infuriated cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it amasis would die before cambyses reached him but his heir and son psamtik iii would be defeated by the persians name hero  name herodotus 
first an alliance agreement was signed with the n king  and  the babylonian king in 542 bc the implementation of the agreements in real aid did not took place in 541 bc croesuss empire was conquered and in 539 bce the neo babylonian empire was conquered by the persians without egypts support towards its allies
herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor amasis ii relied on greek mercenaries and council men one such figure was  who would later on leave amasis for reasons herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures amasis would send one of his s to capture phanes but the eunuch is bested by the wise council man and phanes flees to persia meeting up with cambyses providing advice in his invasion of egypt egypt would finally be lost to persians during the  name herodotus 
although amasis thus appears first as champion of the disparaged native he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the  and brought egypt into closer touch with it than ever before herodotus relates that under his prudent administration egypt reached a new level of wealth amasis adorned the temples of  especially with splendid ic s and other monuments his activity here is proved by existing remains for example a temple built by him was excavated at 
amasis assigned the commercial colony of  on the  branch of the  to the greeks and when the  was burnt he contributed 1000  to the rebuilding he also married a greek princess named  daughter of king  and made alliances with  of samos and  of lydia
under amasis or ahmose ii egypts agricultural based economy reached its zenith herodotus who visited egypt less than a century after amasis iis death writes that
his kingdom consisted probably of egypt only as far as the  but to this he added  and his influence was great in cyrene in his fourth year c 567 bce amasis was able to defeat an invasion of egypt by the babylonians under  henceforth the babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against amasisalan b lloyd the late period in the oxford history of ancient egypt ed ian shaw oxford univ press 2002 paperback pp381 82  however amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of persia under  who ascended to the throne in 559 bce his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending persian onslaught against egypt name lloyd2002p382lloyd 2002 p382  with great strategic skill cyrus had destroyed lydia in 546 bce and finally defeated the babylonians in 538 bce which left amasis with no major near eastern allies to counter persias increasing military might name lloyd2002p382  amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the greek states to counter the future persian invasion into egypt but was fortunate to have died in 526 bce shortly before the persians attacked name lloyd2002p382  the final assault instead fell upon his son  whom the persians defeated in 525 bce after a reign of only six monthsthe new encyclopædia britannica micropædia vol9 15th edition 2003 p756 
amasis ii died in 526 bc he was buried at the royal necropolis of sais and while his tomb was never discovered herodotus describes it for us

after an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed joan called on sforza who defeated the aragonese militias near  in naples alfonso fled to  but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by  improved his situation sforza and joan ransomed caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of  here she repudiated her earlier adoption of alfonso and with the backing of martin v named louis iii as her heir instead
the duke of milan  joined the anti aragonese coalition alfonso requested support from braccio da montone who was besieging joans troops in  but had to set sail for spain where a war had broken out between his brothers and the  on his way towards barcelona alfonso destroyed  a possession of louis iii

in milan however he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in milans interest to prevent the victory of the aragonese party in naples helped by a sicilian fleet alfonso recaptured capua and set his base in gaeta in february 1436 meanwhile papal troops had invaded the neapolitan kingdom but alfonso bribed their commander cardinal  and their successes waned
in the meantime rené had managed to reach naples on 19 may 1438 alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following september but failed his brother pedro was killed during the battle castel nuovo where an aragonese garrison resisted fell to the angevine mercenaries in august 1439 after the death of his condottiero  however renés fortune started to decline alfonso could easily capture     and  rené whose possession included now only part of the  and naples obtained 10000 men from the pope but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with alfonso giovanni sforza came with a reduced corps as troops sent by eugene iv had halted his father francesco in the

amati is the last name of a family of   makers who lived at  from about 1538 to 1740  their importance is considered equal to those of the   and  families today violins created by nicolò amati are evaluated at around 600000http  wwwviolinadvisorcom pricehistoryhtm violin price histories violinadvisorcom accessed 18 martie 2014 
andrea amati ca 1505 – ca 1578 designed and created the violin viola and cello known as the violin family he standardized the basic form shape size materials and method of construction makers from nearby brescia experimented such as gasparo da salò micheli zanetto and pellegrino but it was andrea amati in cremona italy who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile the first violin was ordered by  in 1555 his letter to amati stated the instrument was to be made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute but simple to play the first violin was intended to be used by illiterate musicians so the design was simple and it was easy to play what became of this first violin is not known  a number of his instruments survived for some time dating between 1538 amati made the first cello called the king in 1538 1 and 1574 the largest number these are from 1560 a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by  the regent queen of france and bore hand painted royal french decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son  of these 38 instruments ordered amati created violins of two sizes violas of two sizes and large sized cellos they were in use until the french revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived his work is marked by selection of the finest materials great elegance in execution soft clear amber soft translucent varnish and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design

andrea amati was succeeded by his sons antonio amati ca 1537–1607 and girolamo amati ca 1551–1630 the brothers amati as they were known implemented far reaching innovations in design including the perfection of the shape of the  they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of  in contrast to older tenor violas but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that  made violas ranging from altos of 39ampnbspcm to tenors of 447ampnbspcm
nicolò amati december 3 1596 – april 12 1684 was the son of girolamo amati he was the most eminent of the family he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of  his pattern was unusually small but he also made a wider model now known as the grand amati which have become his most sought after violins
of his pupils the most famous were  and  the first of the guarneri family of violin makers there is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of antonio stradivari while stradivaris first known violin states  that he was a pupil of amati the validity of his statement is questioned
the last maker of the family was nicolos son girolamo amati known as hieronymus ii february 26 1649 – february 21 1740 although he improved on the arching of his fathers instruments by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day antonio stradivari

 reported that the sarmatians were descendants of amazons and scythians and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands in war taking the field and wearing the very same dress as the men moreover said herodotus no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle in the story related by herodotus a group of amazons was blown across the  the  into  near the cliff region todays southeastern  after learning the scythian language they agreed to marry scythian men on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of scythian women according to herodotus this band moved toward the northeast settling beyond the   river and became the ancestors of the  according to herodotus the  fought with the scythians against  in the 5th century bce

ambergris occurs as a  secretion of the  of the sperm whale and can be found floating upon the sea or lying on the coast it is also sometimes found in the s of s because the beaks of s have been found embedded within lumps of ambergris scientists have theorised that the substance is produced by the whales gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard sharp objects that the whale might have eaten the sperm whale usually vomits these but if one travels further down the gut it will be covered in ambergris name uchicago1  
ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter it is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit  it takes years for ambergris to form christopher kemp the author of floating gold a natural and unnatural history of ambergris says that it is only produced by sperm whales and only by an estimated one percent of them once expelled by a whale it must float for years then it must make landfall avoid being broken into pieces by rough seas and someone must find it  in other words the odds of finding ambergris are extremely small the very small chance of finding ambergris and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris

ambiorix was together with  prince of the  leader of a  tribe of north eastern   where modern  is located in the 19th century ambiorix became a   because of his  against  as written in caesars  name dgrbm 
in 57 bc julius caesar conquered parts of  and also  belgium modern day northern france luxembourg part of present day netherlands below the  river and the north western portion of north rhine westphalia germany there were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently the  were ruled by ambiorix and  in 54 bc caesars troops urgently needed more food and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their  which had not been good that year understandably the  eburones were reluctant to do so and caesar ordered that  be built near the eburones villages each  was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the   this created resentment among the eburones
although  had freed him from paying tribute to the  ambiorix joined  in the winter of 54 bc in an uprising against the  forces under  and 
because a drought had disrupted his grain supply caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious belgic tribes roman troops led by q titurius sabinus and l aurunculeius cotta were wintering among the eburones when they were attacked by them led by ambiorix and cativolcus ambiorix deceived the romans telling them the attack was made without his consent and further advised them to flee as a large germanic force was preparing to cross the rhine trusting ambiorix sabinus and cottas troops left the next morning a short distance from their camp the roman troops were ambushed by the eburones and massacred
elsewhere another roman force under  brother of the orator  were wintering amongst the nervii leading a coalition of rebellious belgic tribes ambiorix surrounded ciceros camp after a long while a roman messenger was finally able to slip through the belgic lines and get word of the uprising to caesar mobilizing his legions caesar immediately marched to ciceros aid as they approached the besieged roman camp the belgae moved to engage caesars troops vastly outnumbered caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened and they successfully lured the belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the romans caesars forces launched a fierce counterattack and soon put the belgae to flight later caesars troops entered ciceros camp to find most of the men wounded
meanwhile indutiomarus a leader of the treveri began to harass the camp of labienus on a daily basis eventually provoking labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill indutiomarus they did so and routed the remnants of the late indutiomaruss army caesar personally remained in gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed gallic threat
when the  heard what had happened caesar swore to put down all the belgic tribes ambiorix had killed a whole roman  and five  a belgic attack on q tullius cicero then stationed with a legion in the territory of the  failed due to the timely appearance of caesar the roman campaigns against the belgae took a few years but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned the eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event according to the writer  ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the  and disappeared without a trace iii 10 § 8 
caesar wrote about ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the gauls  in this text he also wrote the famous line of these three regions the belgae are the bravest ampnbsphorum omnium fortissimi sunt belgaeampnbsp
ambiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the 19th century when belgium became independent in 1830 the national government started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as  in caesars de bello gallico they discovered ambiorix and his deeds in 1841 the belgian poet  wrote a al  about ambiorix and on september 5 1866 a statue of ambiorix was erected on the main market square in  belgium erred to by caesar as  ie atuatuca tungrorum
today ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in  history many companies bars and s have named themselves after him and in many belgian  such as  and  he plays a guest role there was also a short lived comic called ambionix  which featured a scientist teleporting a belgic chief loosely based on ambiorix to modern day belgium
in the french comic  in the album     and  go to belgium because they are angry with caesar about his remark that the belgians are the bravest of all the gauls

during what many s call the formative period amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of south americas highland  systems and possibly contributed directly to the social and religious fabric constitutive of the  civilizational orders
early human settlements were typically based on low lying hills or mounds

shell mounds were the earliest they represent piles of human use and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 bp they all represent pottery age cultures no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists
artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds they are best represented by the 
figurative mounds are the latest chronologically

orellana took about 57 men the boat and some canoes and left pizarros party on 26 december 1541 however orellana apparently missed the confluence probably with the  where he was to look for food by the time he and his men reached another village many of them were sick from hunger and eating noxious plants and near death seven men died at that village his men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join pizarros larger party he accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of spain and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream after a journey of 600ampnbspkm down the napo river they reached a further major confluence at a point near modern  and then followed the upper amazon now known as the solimões for a further 1200ampnbspkm to its confluence with the rio negro near modern  which they reached on 3 june 1542 on the  a tributary of the amazon downstream from manaus orellanas party had a fierce battle with warriors who they reported were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat orellanas men began erring to the women as  a erence to the women of  the river was initially known as the  the name by which the peruvian part of the river is still known today or rio de orellana it later became known as the rio amazonas the name by which it is still known in both spanish and portuguese
regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees but that they could not be profitably harvested in fact true cinnamon cinnamomum verum is not native to south america other related cinnamon containing plants of the family lauraceae are fairly common in that part of the amazon and pizarro probably saw some of these the expedition reached the mouth of the amazon on 24 august 1542 demonstrating the practical navigability of the great river

  and  1848–1859
the  revolt 1835–1840 was directed against the white ruling class it is estimated that from 30 to 40% of the population of  estimated at 100000 people died 
the total population of the brazilian portion of the amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300000 of whom about two thirds were europeans and slaves the slaves amounting to about 25000 the brazilian amazons principal commercial city pará now belém had from 10000 to 12000 inhabitants including slaves the town of manáos now manaus at the mouth of the rio negro had a population between 1000 to 1500 all the remaining villages as far up as  on the brazilian frontier of peru were relatively small
on 6 september 1850 emperor  sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the amazon and gave the viscount of mauá  the task of putting it into effect he organized the companhia de navegação e comércio do amazonas in rio de janeiro in 1852 in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers the monarca monarch the cametá the marajó and the rio negro 
at first navigation was principally confined to the main river and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between pará and manaus with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity a second line to make six round voyages a year between manaus and tabatinga and a third two trips a month between pará and cametá this was the first step in opening up the vast interior
the success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the amazon and a second company soon opened commerce on the madeira purús and negro a third established a line between pará and manaus and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams in that same period the amazonas company was increasing its fleet meanwhile private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries
on 31 july 1867 the government of brazil constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the  basin especially peru decreed the opening of the amazon to all countries but they limited this to certain defined points tabatinga – on the amazon cametá – on the tocantins santarém – on the tapajós borba – on the madeira and manaus – on the rio negro the brazilian decree took effect on 7 september 1867

the first direct foreign trade with manaus commenced around 1874 local trade along the river was carried on by the english successors to the amazonas company—the amazon steam navigation company—as well as numerous small steamboats belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade navigating the negro madeira purús and many other tributaries such as the marañón to ports as distant as  peru
by the turn of the 20th century the exports of the amazon basin were  s s and a few other products of minor importance such as  and exotic forest produce s barks woven s prized bird s live animals and extracted goods such as  and gold
for 350 years after the first european encounter of the amazon by pinzón the portuguese portion of the basin remained an untended former food gathering and planned agricultural landscape occupied by the  who survived the arrival of european diseases
four centuries after the european discovery of the amazon river the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than  excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters this situation changed dramatically during the 20th century
wary of foreign exploitation of the nations resources brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land the original architect of this expansion was president  with the demand for rubber from the allied forces in world war ii providing funding for the drive
in 1960 the construction of the new capital city of  in the interior also contributed to the opening up of the amazon basin a large scale colonization program saw families from northeastern brazil relocated to the forests encouraged by promises of cheap land many settlements grew along the road from brasília to belém but rainforest soil proved difficult to cultivate
still long term development plans continued roads were cut through the forests and in 1970 the work on the  transamazônica network began the networks three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise large portions of the trans amazonian and its accessory roads such as  manaus  are derelict and impassable in the rainy season small towns and villages are scattered across the forest and because its vegetation is so dense some remote areas are still unexplored
with a population of 19 million people in 2014 manaus is the largest city on the amazon manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest brazilian state of  the racial makeup of the city is 64%  mulatto and mestizo and 32%  
  see talk page re most distant source 15 november 2015  the most distant source of the amazon was thought to be in the apurímac river drainage for nearly a century such studies continued to be published even recently such as in 1996 name palkiewicz  2001  2007 name bbc amazon  and 2008 name inpe  where various authors identified the snowcapped   peak as the most distant source of the river from this point located roughly  west of  and  southeast of  quebrada  emerges from nevado mismi joins quebrada apacheta and soon forms río lloqueta which becomes río hornillos and eventually joins the  after about 700ampnbspkm the apurímac then joins río mantaro  to form the ene which joins the perene to form the tambo which joins the urubamba to form the ucayali which later joins río marañón to form what most people subsequently call the amazon river
a 2014 study by americans james contos and nicolas tripcevich in  a peer reviewed journal of the  however identifies the most distant source of the amazon as actually being in the  drainage name contostripcevich    a variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the mantaro river vs the apurimac river from their most distant source points to their confluence showing the longer length of the mantaro  then distances from lago junín to several potential source points in the uppermost mantaro river were measured which enabled them to determine that the cordillera rumi cruz was the most distant source of water in the mantaro basin and theore in the entire amazon basin  the most accurate measurement method was direct gps measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence performed by contos obtaining these measurements was difficult given the  nature of each of these rivers especially in their lower abyss sections  ultimately they determined that the most distant point in the mantaro drainage is nearly 80ampnbspkm farther upstream compared to mt mismi in the apurímac drainage and thus the maximal length of the amazon river is about 80ampnbspkm longer than previously thought contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the amazon river from its newly identified source finishing november 2012 a journey repeated by two groups after the news spreadbloggeographydirectionscom 2014 04 03 redefining the upper amazon river  
while the ucayali–marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the amazon proper in brazil the river is known at this point as the  das Águas further downriver from that confluence the darkly colored waters of the rio negro meet the sandy colored  and for over  these waters run side by side without mixing
after the confluence of apurímac and ucayali the river leaves andean terrain and is surrounded by  from this point to the marañón some  the forested banks are just out of water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage the low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills and the river enters the enormous 
the river systems and flood plains in brazil peru ecuador colombia and venezuela whose waters drain into the solimões and its tributaries are called the upper amazon
the amazon river proper runs mostly through brazil and peru it is part of the border between colombia and perú and it has tributaries reaching into venezuela colombia ecuador and bolivia
 has a series of major river systems in   and  some of which flow into the  and ucayali others directly into the amazon proper among others these include the following rivers       nucuray urituyacu     and 
at some points the river divides into es or multiple channels often very long with inland and lateral  all connected by a complicated system of natural canals cutting the low flat igapó lands which are never more than  above low river into many islands
from the town of canaria at the great bend of the amazon to the negro vast areas of land are submerged at high water above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear near the mouth of the rio negro to serpa nearly opposite the river madeira the banks of the amazon are low until approaching manaus they rise to become rolling hills at Óbidos a bluff  above the river is backed by low hills the lower amazon seems to have once been a  of the atlantic ocean the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos
only about ten percent of the amazons water enters downstream of Óbidos very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley the drainage area of the amazon basin above Óbidos city is about  and below only about  around 20% exclusive of the  of the tocantins basin the  enters the southern portion of the amazon delta
in the lower reaches of the river the north bank consists of a series of steep table topped hills extending for about  from opposite the mouth of the xingu as far as  these hills are cut down to a kind of  which lies between them and the river
on the south bank above the xingu a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to  in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest and abutting upon the lower tapajós merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the tapajós river valley
 is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the atlantic ocean  the definition of where exactly the mouth of the amazon is located and how wide it is is a matter of dispute because of the areas peculiar geography the pará and the amazon are connected by a series of river channels called furos near the town of  between them lies  the worlds largest combined river sea island
if the pará river and the marajó island ocean frontage are included the amazon  is some  wide name guo   in this case the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from cabo norte the cape located straight east of  in the brazilian state of  to ponta da tijoca near the town of  in the state of 
a more conservative measurement excluding the pará river estuary from the mouth of the  to ponta do navio on the northern coast of marajó would still give the mouth of the amazon a width of over  if only the rivers main channel is considered between the islands of curuá state of amapá and jurupari state of pará the width falls to about 
while debate as to whether the amazon or the  is the worlds longest river has gone on for many years the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the amazon as the second longest river in the world with the nile being the longest however the amazon has been measured by different geographers as being anywhere between  long it is often said to be at least  long name britannica amazon  the nile is reported to be anywhere from  often it is said to be about  long name britannica nile  there are many factors that can affect these measurements
a study by brazilian scientists concluded that the amazon is actually longer than the nile using  which in 2001 was labeled by the  as the amazons source these scientists made new calculations of the amazons length they calculated the amazons length as  using the same techniques they calculated the length of the nile as  which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the amazon they made it possible by measuring the amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of canal do sul and then after a sharp turn back following tidal canals surrounding the isle of marajó and finally including the marine waters of the río pará bay in its entire length name inpe     director of science at the  ibge told the brazilian tv network  in june 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the amazon was the longest river in the world however other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001 and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these brazilian scientists the length of both the amazon and the nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate name britannica amazon  
the amazon basin the largest in the world covers about 40% of south america an area of approximately  it drains from west to east from  in peru across brazil to the atlantic it gathers its waters from  to  its most remote sources are found on the inter  plateau just a short distance from the  the locals often er to it as el jefe negro erring to an ancient god of fertility
the amazon river and its tributaries are characterized by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season every year the river rises more than  flooding the surrounding forests known as  flooded forests the amazons flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world name wwf  in an average   of land are water covered while in the  the flooded area of the amazon basin rises to  name guo 
the quantity of water released by the amazon to the atlantic ocean is enormous up to  in the rainy season with an average of  from 1973 to 1990molinier et al http  horizondocumentationirdfr exl doc pleins_textes pleins_textes_6 colloques2 42687pdf  the amazon is responsible for about 20% of the earths  entering the ocean name wwf   the river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean the plume is about  long and between  wide the fresh water being lighter flows on top of the seawater diluting the  and altering the color of the ocean surface over an area up to  in extent for centuries ships have reported fresh water near the amazons mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean name smith  
the atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the amazons s out to sea thus the amazon does not form a true delta the great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water while the amazon empties directly into the turbulent atlantic name penn 
there is a natural water union between the amazon and the  basins the so called  the casiquiare is a river  of the upper orinoco which flows southward into the rio negro which in turn flows into the amazon the casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems a so called 
 not all of the amazons tributaries flood at the same time of the year many branches begin flooding in november and may continue to rise until june the rise of the rio negro starts in february or march and begins to recede in june the madeira river rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the amazon
the depth of the amazon between  and  has been calculated as between  at manacapuru the amazons water level is only about  above  more than half of the water in the amazon downstream of manacapuru is below sea level name junk  in its lowermost section the amazons depth averages  in some places as much as  name whitton 
the main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to   upriver from the mouth smaller ocean vessels of 3000 tons or 9000 tons name encarta   and   can reach as far as  peru  from the sea smaller riverboats can reach  higher as far as achual point beyond that small boats frequently ascend to the  just above achual point
annual flooding is caused by tidal waves called pororoca which occur in late winter at high tide when the  overlaps into the river the resulting waves can be up to  high and travel  inlandhttp  amazingstuffcouk sport surfing the pororoca 2 #uixxwdbivoz

the amazon river originated as a transcontinental river in the miocene epoch between 118 million and 113 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 24 million years ago
the amazon once flowed west as part of a proto amazon congo river system from the interior of present day africa when the continents were joined as western  fifteen million years ago the andes were formed by the collision of the south american plate with the nazca plate the rise of the andes and the linkage of the brazilian and guyana bedrock shields blocked the river and caused the amazon to become a vast inland sea gradually this inland sea became a massive swampy freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater for example over 20 species of stingray most closely related to those found in the pacific ocean can be found today in the freshwaters of the amazon
ten to eleven million years ago waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the amazon began to flow eastward leading to the emergence of the amazon rainforest during ice ages sea levels dropped and the great amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river which would eventually become the worlds largest draining the most extensive expanse of rainforest on the planet 
scientists have discovered the longest underground river actually a   in the world in brazil water in the aquifer flows a distance of  at a depth of nearly  it flows from the andean foothills to the atlantic coast in a nearly west to east direction like the amazon river the discovery was made public in august 2011 name tvibtimescom  meeting of the brazilian geophysical society in  the river named  after the discoverer an indian born scientist  who is working with the national observatory at rio makes it the first and geologically unusual instance of a twin river system flowing at different levels of the earths crust in brazil a combination of  data and anomalous temperature variation with depth measured in 241 inactive oil wells helped locate the aquifer except for the flow direction the amazon and the hamza have very different characteristics the most obvious ones are their width and flow speed while the amazon is  to  wide the hamza is  to  in width but the flow speed is   in the amazon and less than  speed in the hamza name tvibtimescom  
several geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies the large deep aquifer formed when the plate carrying the pacific ocean bottom was dragged and ends up under the continental plate water at such depths would normally escape upwards but the unusual conditions that exist along the eastern pacific rim allow the moisture to remain intact in the case of the hamza the  and  s behave as conduits for the water to sink to greater depths east west trending  and the  present along the northern border of the amazon basin may have some role in supplying water to the river if the impermeable rocks stop the vertical flow the west to east gradient of the topography directs it to flow towards the atlantic ocean
unlike the hamza the 153ampnbspkm long underground river in mexicos  and the 82ampnbspkm long  in the in the  have come into being thanks to the  water in these places has dissolved the carbonate rock to form  extensive underground river systems

alredus or alfred of beverley  1143  was  of the church of  in the first half of the twelfth century
he wrote apparently about the year 1143 a  entitled annales sive historia de gestis regum britanniae which begins with  and carries the history of england down to 1129  and  are alfreds chief sources
alfred of beverley was a priest of beverley and is described in the pace to his book as treasurer of the church of beverley and master alfred sacrist of the church of beverley
alfred of beverley speaks of himself as contemporary with the removal of the flemings from the north of england to ross in heordshire in 1112 and writes that he compiled his chronicle when the church was silent owing to the number of persons excommunicated under the decree of the council of london an apparent erence to the council held at mid lent 1143 his attention by his own account was first drawn to history by the publication before 1139 of   and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name and which largely depends on geoffreys work with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the  but no trace of such a work is extant
alfred of beverleys chronicle is entitled aluredi beverlacensis annales sive historia de gestis regum britanniæ libris ix ad annum 1129 it is largely devoted to the fabulous history of britain and is mainly borrowed from   and  when geoffrey of monmouth is not laid under contribution alfred quotes occasionally from   and  and names many roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for erences to britain the chronicle is of no real use to the historical student since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well known earlier authorities
according to sidney lee 1885 the best manuscript of alfreds annales was among the hengwrt mss belonging to w w e wynne esq of peniarth merionethshire and had not been printed hearne printed the ‘annales’ in 1716 from an inferior bodleian ms rawl b 200

after staying at the cave for three days and three nights abu bakr and muhammad proceed to  staying for some time at quba a suburb of medina while  sources portray abu bakr in an exalted light in the cave  sources however generally tend to portray the incident in the cave as a quranic condemnation of abu bakr for cowardice and fearabu bakr al mundhir amputation and the art of ijtihadscott c lucaspg351 368j middle east stud392007351 368printed in us 
in medina muhammad decided to construct a  a piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by abu bakr muslims constructed a mosque named  at the site and abu bakr also took part in construction abu bakr was paired with khaarij ah bin zaid ansari who was from medina as a  abu bakrs relationship with khaarjah was most cordial which was further strengthened when abu bakr married habiba a daughter of khaarijah
khaarij ah bin zaid ansari used to live at sunh a suburb of medina and abu bakr also settled there after abu bakrs family arrived in medina he bought another house near muhammads abu bakr the first caliph of islam by muhammad habibur rahman khan sherwani published 1963 sh muhammad ashraf original from the university of michigan digitized 14 november 2006 
the climate of mecca was dry but the climate of medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants so that on arrival most of them fell sick abu bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by khaarijah and his family at mecca abu bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in medina he was a wholesaler and had his store at sunh and from there cloth was supplied to the market at medina soon his business flourished at medina early in 623 abu bakrs daughter  who was already engaged to muhammad was handed over to muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony and this further strengthened the relation between abu bakr and muhammad name maghazi 
in 624 abu bakr was involved in the first battle between the muslims and the quraysh of mecca known as the  but did not fight instead acting as one of the guards of muhammads tent in 625 he participated in the  which ended in a rout by the majority of the muslims before the battle begun abu bakrs son  who was still non muslim and was fighting from the side of the quraysh came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel abu bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by muhammad his son later converted to  and gained fame during the  as a fierce warrior in the second phase of the battle ’s cavalry attacked the muslims from behind changing a muslim victory to defeat many muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war so did abu bakr however he was among the first to return according to few  hadith   and a few other muslims remained guarding muhammad from the attacks of the quraysh soldiers majority of  and many sunni hadith agree to this criticisms of his lacklustre military achievements in comparison with the extremely accomplished ali should be put into context abu bakr was a middle aged man during these battles was not a soldier but a merchant by trade and had never seen battle before – it may thus be unfair to directly compare him with ali in this regard
however it is related that once  asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men everyone replied that ali was the bravest of all men thereupon ali said
in sunni accounts during one such attack two discs from abu bakrs shield penetrated into muhammads cheeks abu bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah requested he leave the matter to him losing his two s during the process in these stories subsequently abu bakr along with other companions led muhammad to a place of safety name maghazi 
later in the year abu bakr was a part of campaign against the ish tribe of 
in 627 he participated in the  and also in the  name maghazi  in this battle muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector one of such contingents was under the command of abu bakr the enemy made frequent assaults in the attempt to cross the ditch all such assaults were repulsed abu bakr showed great courage in guarding the belt of the trench in his sector to commemorate this event a mosque was later constructed at the site where abu bakr had heroically repulsed the charges of the enemy the mosque was later known as masjid i siddiqsidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 36 published and printed by a salam ferozsons ltd 60 shahrah e quaid e azam lahore

in 630 he was part of  and  in the battle of hunayn as the muslim army passed through the valley of hunayn some eleven miles north east of  a rain of arrows fell on it let loose by a group of archers of the hostile tribes that lay hid in the mountain pass taken unaware the advance guard of the muslim army fled in panic there was considerable confusion and the camels horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover muhammad stood firm there were only nine companions around him including abu bakr all the rest had fled under the instructions of muhammad abbas shouted at the top of his voice o muslims come to the prophet of allah the call was heard by the muslim soldiers and they gathered beside muhammad when the muslim had gathered in sufficient number muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy in the hand to hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to 
muhammad posted a contingent to guard the hunayn pass and led the main army to autas in the confrontation at autas the tribes could not withstand the muslim onslaught finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to taif
abu bakr was commissioned by muhammad to lead the attack against taif from autas the muslim forces set out for taif the tribes shut themselves in the fort and used to come out in the open the muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town but this did not lead to any tangible results the muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective
the siege dragged on for two weeks and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort muhammad held a council of war abu bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that god would himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort the advice was accepted and in february 630 the siege of taif was raised and the muslim army returned to  a few days later malik bin auf the commander came to  and became a muslim thus the forecast of abu bakr came to be fulfilled and the god himself arranged for the surrender of taifsidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 46 printed and published by a salam ferozsons ltd 60 shahrah e quaid e azam lahore 
in 630 ad muhammad decided to lead an expedition to  on the  border in order to finance the expedition muhammad invited contributions and donations from his followers  provided ten thousand camels  made a liberal contribution when muhammad asked him how much he had left for himself and his family he said that he has given one half of his wealth for the cause of god and had left one half for himself and his dependents then abu bakr came loaded with his contribution and muhammad put him the same question as to how much wealth he had for himself and his family abu bakr said i have brought all that i had i have left allah and his prophet for myself and my family this episode has formed the theme of one of the poems of  the last verse of this poem reads
the call to arms was given at a very critical period the weather was burning hot crops were ripe and ready for harvesting the journey was long and arduous many persons perred to stay back in spite of these obstacles and difficulties an army of thirty thousand persons was raised the army assembled at al jorf outside  muhammad remained at medina for some time to attend to other affairs and at al jorf abu bakr deputised for muhammad and led the prayers
the muslim army reached tabuk after a weary march at tabuk the standard of the army was entrusted to abu bakr there were no  forces to meet the muslims on coming to know of the advance of the muslim army the byzantines had withdrawn their army well within  the muslim achieved their object without fighting a shot the byzantines who had at one time threatened to invade  were no longer in the mood to measure swords with the muslimssidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 47 48 
in 631 ad muhammad sent from medina a delegation of three hundred muslims to perform the  according to the new islamic way abu bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates abu bakr had thus the honour of being the first amir ul hajj in the history of 
some time after abu bakr and his party had left for hajj muhammad received  a revelation about the regulation of the hajj and the ordering of relationships with the infidels it is related that when this revelation came some one suggested to muhammad that he should send news of it to abu bakr muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation
muhammad summoned ali and asked him to proclaim the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at  ali went forth on muhammads slit eared camel and overtook abu bakr when ali joined the party abu bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them ali said that he had not come to replace abu bakr as amir ul hajj and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of muhammad
at mecca abu bakr presided at the hajj ceremony and ali read the proclamation on behalf of muhammad the main points of the proclamation were
#henceforward the non muslims were not to be allowed to visit the  or perform the pilgrimage
#no one should circumambulate the kaaba naked
# was not to be tolerated where the muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists
from the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in  henceforward islam alone was to be supreme in arabia
in some quarters an argument is advanced that as on this occasion the proclamation was read by  on behalf of  this establishes the precedence of ali over abu bakr and that theore when after the death of muhammad abu bakr became the  in disregard of the claims of ali he was a usurper
on this occasion ali did not replace abu bakr as amir ul hajj ali was merely assigned a special mission to read the proclamation as according to muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation we can thus say that on this occasion abu bakr represented the temporal side while ali represented the spiritual side after the death of muhammad there was no longer the question of any spiritual representation the issue was only temporal representation and for this abu bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented muhammad even in his lifetimesidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 49 50

a short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage muhammad became ill in his fatal illness muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit after thanking and praising god he said  allah has given one of his slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly life whatever he likes or to accept the good which is with allah so he has chosen that good which is with allah
abu bakr wept profusely and said our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you the companions were astonished by this they wondered why abu bakr wept and the people said look at this old man allahs apostle talks about a  to whom he has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with him while he says our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you it turned out muhammad himself was that servant as abu bakr later told the companions
muhammad continued

abu bakr arrived and said sit down o umar but umar used to sit down so the people came to abu bakr and left umar abu bakr said
to proceed if anyone amongst you used to worship muhammad then muhammad has passed away but if anyone of you used to worship allah then allah is alive and shall never die allah said and muhammad is but a messenger the messengers have come before him if then he dies or is killed will you  and whoever turns back upon his heels he will by no means do harm to allah in the least and allah will reward the grateful 3144

 believe that all the muslims in  gave their allegiance to abu bakr including  all sunnis acknowledged abu bakr as the rightful successor to  on account of him being one of the earliest of companions and on account of his aiding and supporting muhammad in his mission from the very early days of islam from his deep knowledge and piety from having spent so many years with muhammad and on account of so many indications that muhammad gave that abu bakr is the right successor examples of these include muhammad specifically designating abu bakr to lead the muslims in prayer in his last days when he was too ill to lead the prayer muhammad also appointed to abu bakr to lead the pilgrimage to  there was also a time when a woman came to muhammad with a question and he asked her to come back tomorrow she then asked what if i do not find you and he then said go to abu bakr according to sunnis all of these show the virtue of abu bakr and his being the rightful successor

there is a famous hadith in sahih bukhari which sunni muslims say shows the superiority of abu bakr over everyone else and making him the only logical choice to take the leadership of the muslim community after muhammad it was narrated by jubair bin mutim who said
a woman came to the prophet who ordered her to return to him again she said what if i came and did not find you as if she wanted to say if i found you dead the prophet said if you should not find me go to abu bakr name sunnahcomhttp  sunnahcom bukhari 62 11 
after assuming the office of  abu bakrs first address was as follows
abu bakrs caliphate lasted for 27 months during which he crushed the rebellion of the arab tribes throughout the  in the successful  in the last months of his rule he sent general khalid ibn al walid on conquests  in  and  in  this would set in motion a historical trajectory name donner   continued later on by  and  that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the  he had little time to pay attention to the administration of state though state affairs remained stable during his caliphate on the advice of umar and abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade
according to  abu bakr was instrumental in preserving the quran in written form it is said that after the hard won victory over musaylimah in the battle of yamama fought in 632 umar the later caliph umar saw that many of the muslims who had memorized the quran  about 300 to 700 had died in battle fearing that the quran may be lost or corrupted umar requested the caliph abu bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format after initial hesitation abu bakr made a committee headed by  which included the memorizers of the quran and umar and to collect all verses of the book after collecting all quranic verses from texts in the possession of various   and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the quran after they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in codex form to the caliph abu bakr it is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of muhammad when most of his  companions were still alive
prior to his death abu bakr gave this authorized copy of the quran to umar – his successor as caliph it remained with him throughout his tenure as caliph 10 years prior to his death umar gave this book to his daughter  who was one of the wives of muhammad umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed and thus perred to leave this copy with hafsa so as not to indicate his personal perence of who would be the next caliph later on it became the basis of s definitive text of the quran which was published far and wide merely 18 years after the death of muhammad later historians give uthman ibn affan the principal credit for re verification and publishing the quran  twelver shiites reject the idea that abu bakr or umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the quran 
on 23 august 634 abu bakr fell sick and did not recover due to his old age
abu bakr developed high  and was confined to bed his illness was prolonged and when his condition worsened he felt that his end was near realizing his death was near he sent for  and requested him to perform his  since ali had also done it for muhammad
abu bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the muslims after his death though there was already controversy over ali not having been appointedsidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by masudul hasan lahore ferozsons 1976  
he appointed umar as his successor after discussing with some companions some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it due to the tough nature of umar
abu bakr thus dictated his last testament to  as follows
abu bakr next asked  as to how many pieces of cloth were used for muhammads shroud aisha said that three pieces had been used abu bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud on monday 23 august 634 abu bakr died the funeral prayer was led by umar he was buried the same night by the side of muhammads grave in aishas house near al masjid al nabawi
today there are many families which are the descendants of abu bakr most of them are known by the name  and al atiqis or al atiqi al ateeqi in arabic but they are also known by some other names in different localities for example in east   are usually called  which means people of the religion as they were the first to bring islam to this area in  they are commonly known as  and they are well respected by other  clans in  they are known by the name of  there are also al atiqi or atiqi families in saudi arabia kuwait syria yemen iraq and other places in the arabia peninsula all the descendants of abu bakr their ancestors are abdurahman ibn abu bakr and muhammad ibn abu bakr the al bakri family in egypt are the descendants of muhammad ibn abu bakr while the sheekhaal or fiqi umar family found in somalia ethiopia and kenya and the aala atiq families found in the arabia peninsula are the descendants of abdurahman ibn abu bakr
abu bakr became the caliph on 8 june 632 and he died on 23 august 634 he is considered by sunnis as the greatest of all the companions of muhammad jubayr ibn mutim reported that a woman came and spoke to muhammad about a matter he asked her to come back later some time she said tell me if i come later and do not find you jubayr ibn mutim said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back he said if you do not find me then go to abu bakr name sunnahcom 
this particular hadith is used by sunnis and scholars of hadith to demonstrate the superiority of abu bakr over all other companions of muhammad and his rightful succession to muhammad
though the period of his caliphate covers only two years two months and fifteen days it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time the  and 
abu bakr had the distinction of being the first caliph in the history of islam and also the first caliph to nominate a successor he was the only caliph in the history of islam who unded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate name archiveorg

he has the distinction of purchasing the land for

 muslims also consider abu bakr as one of  al ‘ashara al mubashshara whom muhammad had testified were destined for paradise he is regarded as the successor of allahs messenger khalifa rasulullah and first of the rightly guided caliphs – ie  and being the rightful successor to muhammad abu bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of muhammad throughout his life he was always there beside muhammad at every major event it was abu bakrs wisdom that muhammad always honored abu bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of muhammad as umar ibn khattab stated that if the faith of abu bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth the faith of abu bakr would outweigh the othersnarrated by al bayhaqi in ‘al jamia’ lashu’ab al eemaan’ 118 and its narrators are trustworthy 
 
the   believe that  was supposed to assume the  and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by muhammad as his successor at  it is also believed that abu bakr and umar conspired to take over power in the muslim nation after muhammads death in a  against ali the twelver shia do not view abu bakrs being with muhammad in the cave when the two fled mecca as a meritorious act and indeed find significant criticism of abu bakr in the quranic verse of the cave
some   criticize abu bakr because after muhammads death abu bakr used to grant muhammads daughter  the lands of the village of  which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death he used to accept the testimony of her witnesses so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father however abu bakr replied by saying that muhammad had told him that the prophets of god do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he used to give her the lands of fadakhttp  wwwal islamorg fatima the gracious abu muhammad ordoni abu bakr versus fatima az zahra sa al islamorg fatima the gracious by abu   muhammad ordoni 1987  section entitled abu bakr versus fatima az zahra sabrsee also sahih al bukhari volume 5 book 57 number 60 which says fatima sent somebody to abu bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the prophet from what allah had given to his apostle through fai ie booty gained without fighting she asked for the sadaqa ie wealth assigned for charitable purposes of the prophet at medina and fadak and what remained of the khumus ie one fifth of the khaibar booty abu bakr said allahs apostle said we prophets our property is not inherited and whatever we leave is sadaqa but muhammads family can eat from this property ie allahs property but they have no right to take more than the food they need by allah i will not bring any change in dealing with the sadaqa of the prophet and will keep them as they used to be observed in his ie the prophets life time and i will dispose with it as allahs apostle used to do then ali said i testify that none has the right to be worshipped but allah and that muhammad is his apostle and added o abu bakr we acknowledge your superiority then he ie ali mentioned their own relationship to allahs apostle and their right abu bakr then spoke saying by allah in whose hands my life is i love to do good to the relatives of allahs apostle rather than to my own relatives abu bakr added look at muhammad through his family

ambrose emerged as a leading advocate of the  this attitude he showed clearly when he attended the  as legate of  and defended the primacy of the roman pontiff and adjured the council not to rend asunder  seamless robe he was next sent by the  to the emperor  to ask his aid in the popes efforts to end this council which for five years had been encroaching on papal prerogatives the pope transferred the council from  to  on 18 september 1437

ambrosians are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around  and also a 16th century sect of 
only the oldest of the catholic ambrosians the fratres s ambrosii ad nemus had anything more than a very local significance this order is known from a  of  addressed to the s of the church of st ambrose outside milan
saint  bishop of milan certainly did not found  though he took an interest in the  and watched over its beginnings in his  providing for the needs of a  outside the walls of milan as  recounts in his  ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of virgins as also of widows his exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings de virginibus de viduis de virginitate de institutione virginis de exhortatione virginitatis and de lapsu virginis consecratae ambrose was the only father of the church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of  communities which later became formal monasteries of women 
it is against this background that two religious orders or congregations—one of men and one of women when founded in the milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries—took saint ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name
the first of these groups was formed in a wood outside milan by three noble milanese alexander grivelli antonio petrasancta and albert besuzzi who were joined by others including some  priests in 1375  gave them the rule of st augustine with set of constitutions as a canonically recognized order they took the name fratres sancti ambrosii ad nemus and adopted a habit consisting of a brown   and hood the brethren elected a superior with the title of  who was then instituted by the  the priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes in the liturgy they followed the  various monasteries were founded on these lines but without any formal bond between them in 1441  merged them into one congregation called congregatio sancti ambrosii ad nemus made the original house the main seat and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter there was a rector or superior general who was assisted by two visitors
saint charles borromeo archbishop of milan successfully ormed their discipline grown lax in 1579 in 1589  united to the congregation of st ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the brothers of the apostles of the poor life or  apostolini or brothers of st barnabas whose houses were in the province of genoa and in the march of ancona this was an order that had been founded by giovanni scarpa at the end of the 15th century the union  was confirmed by  in 1606 at which time the congregation added the name of st barnabas to its title adopted new constitutions divided its houses into four provinces two of them st clements and st pancrass being in rome published works have survived from the pen of ascanio tasca and michele mulozzani each of whom was superior general and of zaccaria visconti francesco maria guazzi and paolo fabulotti although various ambrosians were given the title of blessed in recognition of their holiness antonio gonzaga of mantua filippo of fermo and gerardo of monza the order was eventually dissolved by  in 1650
the nuns of st ambrose ambrosian sisters wore a habit of the same colour as the brothers of st ambrose conformed to their constitutions and followed the  but were independent in government  gave the nuns canonical status in 1474 their one monastery was on the top of monte varese near lago maggiore on the spot where their foundress the blessed catarina morigia or catherine of palanza had first led a solitary life  other early nuns were the blessed juliana of puriselli benedetta bimia and lucia alciata the nuns were esteemed by st charles borromeo 
another group of cloistered nuns of st ambrose also called the annunciatae italian annunziate of lombardy or sisters of st marcellina were founded in 1408 by three young women of pavia dorothea morosini eleonora contarini and veronica duodi their houses scattered throughout lombardy and venetia were united into a congregation by st pius v under the rule of st augustine with a mother house residence of the prioress general at pavia one of the nuns in this group was saint  who died on september 14 1510

ambrosiaster is the name given to the writer of a commentary on st  epistles brief in words but weighty in matter and valuable for the criticism of the  text of the  the commentary itself was written during the papacy of  that is between 366 and 384 and is considered an important document of the latin text of paul before the  of  and of the interpretation of paul prior to  name ocd 
this commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to st  in 1527 though  threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to ambrose erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name ambrosiaster literally in latin would be ambrose to describe its author the credit for this nickname should go to the maurists as rené hoven has shown the name has remained with the unknown author name ocd  attempts to identify this ambrosiaster with known authors has continued but with no success because  cites ambrosiasters commentary on romans 512 under the name of hilary many critics have attempted to identify ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named hilary active in the period in 1899  suggested that the writer was isaacrev dhist et de litt religieuses tom iv 97 f  a converted jew and writer of a tract on the trinity and incarnation who was exiled to  in 378 380 and then relapsed to  but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of  proconsul of  in 377 alternatively  attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to ambrose in his complete edition of that fathers work this is extremely problematic though since it would require ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop and then added to it in later years incorporating later remarks of  on romans study of ambrosiaster cambridge univ press 1905  no identifications theore have acquired lasting popularity with scholars and his identity remains a mystery
several other minor works have been attributed to this same author along with a lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates the quaestiones veteris et novi testamenti which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to  in 1905 alexander souter established that this work should also be attributed to ambrosiaster name ocd  name david g hunter 2010 p307david g hunter fourth century latin writers in frances young lewis ayres and andrew louth eds the cambridge history of early christian literature 2010 p307  fragments of several other works have been ascribed with some certainty to ambrosiaster a commentary on matthew 24 a discussion of the parable of the three measures of flour into which a woman placed yeast and a treatment of peters denial and the arrest of jesus in gethsemane the attribution of other fragments to ambrosiaster though is more tentative name david g hunter 2010 p307 
despite the elusive identity of ambrosiaster several facts about him can be established internal evidence suggests he was active at rome during the reign of pope damasus 366 384 and almost certainly a member of the roman clergy there are strong indications he objected to jeromes efforts to revise the old latin versions of the gospels and that he was critical of jeromes activity among ascetic women at rome ambrosiaster shows a deep interest in judaism and often notes that christian practices derive from jewish traditiondavid g hunter fourth century latin writers in frances young lewis ayres and andrew louth eds the cambridge history of early christian literature 2010 p308

ambrosius aurelianus  called  aurelius ambrosius in the  and elsewhere was a  of the  who won an important battle against the  in the 5th century according to   he also appeared independently in the legends of the britons beginning with the 9th century  eventually he was transformed into the uncle of  the brother of arthurs father  and predeceases them both
due to gildas description of him ambrosius is one of the figures called the  name venningvenning 2013 ambrosius aurelianus unnumbered pages 
ambrosius aurelianus is one of the few people that  identifies by name in his sermon  and the only one named from the 5th century name fletcher_15  de excidio is considered the oldest extant british document about the so called arthurian period of  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  following the destructive assault of the saxons the survivors gather together under the leadership of ambrosius who is described as
 a gentleman who perhaps alone of the romans had survived the shock of this notable storm certainly his parents who had worn the purple were slain in it his descendants in our day have become greatly inferior to their grandfathers avita excellence under him our people regained their strength and challenged the victors to battle the lord assented and the battle went their way   name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
some basic information on ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a  gildas says that he won his battles with s help name fletcher_15   ambrosius parents were slain by the saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
according to gildas ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the saxon invaders however this victory was not decisive sometimes the saxons and sometimes the citizens meaning the romano british inhabitants were victorious
two points in gildas description have attracted much scholarly commentary the first is what gildas meant by saying ambrosius family had worn the purple s and roman males of the  wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the erence to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage  tribuni militum senior officers in roman legions wore a similar purple band so the erence may be to a family background of military leadership the tradition was old as the s and  of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band in the church the purple is a euphemism for blood and theore wearing the purple may be a erence to martyrdom name gidlow_80  name craughwellcraughwell 2008 p 106 112  or a bishops robe in addition in the later  both s and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe the  a roman catalogue of official posts lists four or five provincial governors in  and two of them were of consular rank one was the governor of  and the other that of  the parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors whose names were not recorded name ashleyashley 2005 de excidio unnumbered pages 
it has been suggested by historian alex woolf that ambrosius may have been related to the 5th century romano british usurpers  or  – woolf expresses a perence based on nomenclature for marcus name woolf_354  frank d reno an arthurian scholar has instead argued that the name aurelianus indicates the possible descent of ambrosius from the   aurelian reigned 270 275 aurelians military campaigns included the conquest of the  n j higham suggests that ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late  such as the  branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western roman provinces like  name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66 
 instead focuses on the name ambrosius in his view it seems to suggest connection to  a 4th century  who also served as consular governor in areas of  the namesake father of the bishop was a  and his areas included britain  ashley suggests that ambrosius aurelianus was related to the two aurelii ambrosii name ashley  tim venning points out that the name aurelianus could be the result of a  when a boy was adopted into a new  clan he received the family names of his new family plus an additional  indicating his descent from his original gens family the additional cognomen often had the form  anus when  from gens  was adopted into the  family his new name became gaius julius caesar octavianus name venning  in this case ambrosius may have been a member of gens  who was adopted by another gens family his original name aurelius became aurelianus name venning 
the second question is the meaning of the word avita gildas could have meant ancestors or intended it to mean more specifically grandfather – thus indicating ambrosius lived about a generation before the  lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions
n j higham who wrote a book on gildas and the literary tropes he used has suggested that gildas may have had considerable motives for placing attention to ambrosius he was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man but setting him as an example to his contemporaries it was essential to the philosophy of gildas that briton leaders who achieved victory over the s were only able to do so because of divine aid and only those who had superior christian virtues were deserving of this aid name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66  ambrosius aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians in order to fit him in his worldview gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptionable virtues and obedient to god he was made to fit gildas version of a model leader name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66 
higham also suggests that the roman lineage of ambrosius was highlighted for a reason gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the romans he was also contrasting him with the subsequent briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66 
while gildas is a primary source for the  he never mentions the names of the combatants theore we can not know if ambrosius aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  the names of the saxon leaders in the battle are also not recorded 
the identities of ambrosius descendants are unknown since gildas never identifies them by name it is safe to assume that they were gildas contemporaries and known to the author name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66  that the work portrays ambrosius descendants as so inferior to their ancestor would be part of his criticism on rulers of his time those criticized were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66  mike ashley suggests that the descendants of ambrosius could include other people named by gildas he favors the inclusion in this category of one  aurelius the little dog or aurelius the whelp who gildas accuses of    and warmongering his name aurelius suggests romano british descent the insulting nickname caninus was probably invented by gildas himself who similarly insults other contemporary rulers due to the name used by gildas there are theories that this ruler was actually named    some identify him with  a 6th century  though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of gildas or lived one or two generations following him name ashley  another theory is that this ruler did not reign in britain but in  caninus in this view might be  great dog conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of gildas conomor was likely from  an area of brittany controlled by british immigrants from  he might be remembered in british legend as  name ashley 
though gildas primarily features the saxons as barbarian raiders their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest by the year 500 possibly the time described by gildas  controlled the      and coastal areas of  and  the rest of the former  was still under the control of the local britons name craughwell  gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably lects fact  once a major city was completely abandoned during the 5th century name craughwell  name ashley 
 follows gildas account of ambrosius in his  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  but in his chronica majora he dates ambrosius victory to the reign of the  474–491
bedes treatment of the 5th century history of great britain is not particularly valuable as a source until about the year 418 bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of  following the end of orosius history bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on gildas entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of gildas account with mostly stylistic changes name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  bedes account of ambrosius aurelianus has been translated as following
when the army of the enemy had exterminated or scattered the native peoples they returned home and the britons slowly began to recover strength and courage they emerged from their hiding places and with one accord they prayed for the help of god that they might not be completely annihilated their leader at that time was a certain ambrosius aurelianus a discreet man who was as it happened the sole member of the roman race who had survived this storm in which his parents who bore a royal and famous name had perished under his leadership the britons regained their strength challenged their victors to battle and with gods help won the day  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
bede does not mention the descendants of ambrosius aurelianus nor their supposed degeneracy name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
the  attributed to  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  preserves several snippets of lore about ambrosius despite the traditional attribution the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians there are several extant manuscript versions of the work varying and details the most important ones have been dated to between the 9th and the 11th century the possibility of a single writer or compiler seems unlikely as the work may have taken centuries to reach its final form name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
in chapter 31 we are told that  ruled in fear of ambrosius this is the first mention of ambrosius in the work according to frank d reno this would indicate that ambrosius influence was formidable since vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore roman rule in britain name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the chapter relates events following the end of roman rule in britain and preceding vortigerns alliance with the saxons name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
the most significant appearance of ambrosius is the story about ambrosius vortigern and the two s beneath  fortress of ambrosius in chapters 40–42 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  in this account ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers he intimidates vortigern and the royal  when it is reveled that ambrosius is the son of a  vortigern is convinced to  to the younger man the castle of dinas emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of britain vortigern then retreats to the north in an area called gwynessi name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  this story was later retold with more detail by  in his fictionalized  conflating the personage of ambrosius with the welsh tradition of  the visionary known for  utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native ic inhabitants of britain over the  and the  geoffrey also introduces him into the historia under the name aurelius ambrosius as one of three sons of  along with  and 
in chapter 48 ambrosius aurelianus is described as  the chapter records that pascent the son of vortigern was granted rule over the regions of  and  by ambrosius name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  lastly in chapter 66 various events are dated from a  often identified with   ese of  near  which is said to have been between ambrosius and vitolinus the author dates this battle to taking place 12 years from the reign of vortigern name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
it is not clear how these various traditions about ambrosius relate to each other or whether they come from the same tradition it is very possible that these erences are to different men with the same name frank d reno points that the works calls all these men ambrosius emrys alone the  aurelianus is never used name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the  dates the battle of guoloph to the twelfth year of vortigern by which the year 437 seems to be meant name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  this is perhaps a generation before the battle that gildas says was commanded by ambrosius aurelianus
the text never identifies who ambrosiuss father is just gives his title as a roman consul when an adolescent ambrosius speaks of his father there is no suggestion that this father is deceased the boy is not identified as an orphan name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the exact age of ambrosius in his one encounter with vortigern is not given frank d reno suggests that he might be as young as 13 years old barely a teenager name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
it is impossible to know to what degree ambrosius actually wielded political power and over what area because ambrosius and vortigern are shown in the historia brittonum as being in conflict some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another one headed by ambrosius and the other by vortigern  built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in  lected an actively provincial outlook in britain and that vortigern represented the pelagian party while ambrosius led the  one subsequent historians accepted myers speculation as fact creating a narrative of events in 5th century britain with various degrees of elaborate detail yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the historia brittonum is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of vortigern who at this time were a ruling house in  this interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about vortigern in the historia brittonum which include his alleged practice of as argued by nora k chadwick a note on the name vortigern in studies in early british history cambridge university press 1954 p 41 
the identity of ambrosius last mentioned enemy vitalinus is somewhat obscure various manuscripts of the historia and translations render his name guitolin guitolini guitholini and vitalinus he is mentioned in chapter 49 as one of four sons of  and co founder of the city of  no other background information is given name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  there are theories that gloiu is also the father of vortigern but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found there have been further attempts to identify vitalinus with a pro vortigern or anti roman faction in britain opposed to the rise of the romano british ambrosius however this is rendered problematic since vitalinus seems to also have a romano british name the traditional view of pro roman and pro briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
ambrosius appears briefly in the  deeds of the kings of the english by  despite its name the work attempted to reconstruct british history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of gildas bede nennius and various chroniclers name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  the work features ambrosius as the apparent employer of  the relative passage has been translated as following
on the death of  the strength of the britons grew faint their diminished hopes went backwards and straight way they would have come to ruin had not ambrosius the sole survivor of the romans who was monarch of the realm after  repressed the overweening s through the distinguished achievements of the warlike arthur  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
william swiftly shifts attention from ambrosius to arthur and proceeds to narrate arthurs supposed victory in the  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  the narrative is probably the first to connect ambrosius and arthur william had to reconcile the accounts of gildas and bede who implied that ambrosius was connected to the battle and that of nennius which clearly stated that it was arthur who was connected to the battle he solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it ambrosius as the king of the britons and arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
ambrosius aurelianus appears in later pseudo chronicle tradition beginning with s  with the slightly garbled name aurelius ambrosius now presented as son of a king constantine when king constantines eldest son constans is murdered at vortigerns instigation the two remaining sons ambrosius and uther still very young are quickly hustled into exile in  this does not fit with gildas account in which ambrosius family perished in the turmoil of the saxon uprisings later when vortigerns power has faded the two brothers return from exile with a large army destroy vortigern and become friends with   they go on to defeat the saxon leader  in two battles at maisbeli probably ballifield near  and    hengist is executed and ambrosius becomes king of britain however he is poisoned by his enemies and uther succeeds him the text identifies the poisoner as eopa name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
judgements of the value of geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller tend to wildly vary he has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources and condemned for an excessive use of  and possibly inventing stories wholecloth 
 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  according to frank d reno whenever geoffrey uses extant sources the details in the text tend to be accurate assuming he was also using sources lost to us it may be difficult to decide which details are truthful and which  reno suggests that individual judgements have to be made about various elements of his narrative name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
geoffrey changed the word aurelianus to  which is the  of a roman  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  geoffrey retains the story of emrys and the dragons from nennius but identifies the figure with  merlin is geoffreys version of a historical figure known as  myrddin is only mentioned once in the  at an entry dated to 573 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the name of merlin is given in latin as ambrosius merlinus merlinus may have been intended as the  of a roman or romano british individual like ambrosius name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
elements of ambrosius aurelianus the traditional warrior king are used by geoffrey for other characters ambrosius supposed supernatural powers are passed to merlin geoffreys aurelius ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called  the role of warrior king is shared by uther and his son  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
geoffrey also uses the character  father of vitalinus vitolinus deriving from nennius he names this character as a son of claudius and appointed by his father as duke of the  his predecessor as duke is called  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  assuming that claudius and arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries then this claudius is the roman emperor  reigned 41–54 that claudius would have living grandsons in the 5th century four centuries following his death seems rather unlikely reno suggests that a claudius more likely to have living descendants in the 5th century would be  reigned 268–270 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
geoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of ambrosius he is supposedly a paternal nephew of  king of brittany son of  and an unnamed briton noblewoman adoptive grandson on his mothers side of guthelinus vitalinus  younger brother of  and older brother of  name ashley2ashley 2005 geoffrey of monmouth unnumbered pages  ambrosius and uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather guthelinus vitalinus name ashley2  although it is not explicitly covered in geoffreys narrative this genealogy makes constantine and his children descendants of  legendary founder of the line of kings of brittany conan is also featured in the historia regum britanniae where he is appointed king by the roman emperor  reigned 383 388 name ashley2 
constantines reign is placed by geoffrey as following the  mentioned by gildas constantine is reported killed by a  and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis candidates for the throne included all three sons of constantine but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne constans was a  and ambrosius and uther were  and still in their  name ashley2  the crisis is resolved when  places constans on the throne and then serves as his chief  and  when constans is killed by the picts serving as bodyguards of vortigern vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed ambrosius is still underage and vortigern rises to the throne name ashley2 
the chronology offered by geoffrey for the early life life of ambrosius contradicts gildas and nennius and is also internally inconsistent name ashley2  the  involves an appeal by the britons to roman consul agitius this person has been identified with  d 454  master of soldiers of the  and consul of the year 446 the groans are generally dated to the 440s and 450s preceding the death of aetius if geoffreys constantine rose to the throne immediately following the groans this would place his reign in this period name ashley2  geoffrey gives a 10 year reign for constantine and his marriage lasts just as long however the eldest son constans is clearly older than 10 years old by the time his father dies he is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career even assuming there is a time gap between the death of constantine and the adulthood of constans his younger brothers 
have not aged at all in the narrative name ashley2 
geoffreys narrative has an underage ambrosius if not a literal  in the 460s accounts deriving from gildas and nennius place ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade name ashley2  most telling is that geoffrey has vortigern rising to the throne in the 460s nennius places the rise of vortigern in the year 425 and vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the 460s suggesting that he was deceased by that time name ashley2 
geoffreys narrative includes as a major character  as leader of the saxons he is also featured as the father of queen  and father in law of vortigern name ashley2  other saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer but their names tend to correspond to anglo saxons known from other sources name ashley2  henginsts supposed son octa is apparently  a 6th century ruler variously connected to hengist as a son or descendant the other son ebissa is more difficult to identify he might correspond to kinsmen of hengist variously identified as ossa  and aesc a minor saxon character called cherdic is probably  though elsewhere geoffrey calls the same king cheldric he actually may appear under three different names in the narrative since geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of hengist ceretic a variant of the same name name ashley2 
geoffrey in the last chapters featuring vortigern has the king served by  this detail derives from nennius though nennius was talking about vortigerns wise men they may not have been magic users but advisers name ashley2  vortigerns encounter with emrys merlin takes place in this part of the narrative merlin warns vortigern that ambrosius and uther have already sailed for britain and are soon to arrive apparently to claim his throne ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king he besieges vortigern at the castle of genoreu which is identified with nennius cair guorthigirn   and the  at  ambrosius burns the castle down and vortigern dies with it name ashley2 
having killed vortigern ambrosius next turns his attention to hengist despite the fact that no earlier military actions of ambrosius are recorded the saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess they immediately retreat beyond the  name ashley2  hengist soon amasses a massive army to face ambrosius his army counts 200000 men and ambrosius only 10000 men he marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in maisbeli where ambrosius emerges the victor it is unclear what location geoffrey had in mind maisbeli translates to the field of beli and could be related to the  of welsh legend and or the   alternatively it could be a field where the  festival was celebrated name ashley2  geoffrey could derive the name from a similar sounding toponym for example  of the  old north traditionally identified with  name ashley2 
following his defeat hengist retreats towards cunungeburg geoffrey probably had in mind  not far from hatfield name ashley2  ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the saxons the second battle is more evenly fought and hengist has a chance to achieve victory however ambrosius receives reinforcements from brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favor of the britons hengist himself is captured by his old enemy  and decapitated soon after the battle the surviving saxon leaders octa and eosa submit themselves to ambrosius rule he pardons them and grants them an area near  the area is not named but geoffrey could be basing this on  a real ango saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of scotland and england name ashley2 
geoffrey closely connects the deaths of vortigern and hengist which are elsewhere poorly recorded vortigern historically died in the 450s and various dates for the death of hengist have been proposed between the 450s and the 480s name ashley2   the supposed son and heir of hengist was still alive in the 6th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father the ruling family of the  were called the oiscingas a term identifying them as descendants of  not of hengist in effect none of them was likely a literal son of hengist and their relation to hengist may have been a later invention geoffrey did not invent the connection but his sources here were likely legendary  in nature name ashley2 
following his victories and the end of the wars ambrosius organizes the burial of killed nobles at kaercaradduc geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with caer caradog  ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to merlin the result is the so called giants ring name ashley2  its location in the vicinity of salisbury has led to its identification with  though geoffrey never uses that term stonehedge is closer to  than salisbury the ring formation of the monument could equally apply to  the largest stone circle in europe name ashley2 
in welsh legend and texts ambrosius appears as emrys wledig emperor ambrose name venning  the term wledig is a title used by senior royal and military commanders who have achieved notable success the term is mostly used for famous figures such as  though a few obscure figures have been given the title name venning 
in s merlin he is called simply pendragon and his younger brother is named uter which he changes to uterpendragon after the death of the elder sibling this is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from s  wace usually only ers to li roi the king without naming him and someone has taken an early mention of uthers epithet pendragon as the name of his brother
peter korrel supports the view that ambrosius aurelianus and  might be the same person a theory also supported by others debating the  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  he points that all accounts about ambrosius can be traced back to gildas and all accounts about arthur can be traced back to nennius with the two figures being very similar name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
both figures have been connected to the  and have been portrayed as its sole hero name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  their identity as kings is a later addition they are originally depicted as war leaders of the britons in their wars with the saxons the latin term  can be applied to both of them name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  both figures are of roman descent with ambrosius this is featured in both his name and stated background with arthur this is implied since the name seems to derive from  the name of a minor roman  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
both figures are known for their  ambrosius is featured as the one who manages to re assemble the desperate britons encourage them to fight once again and make a stand against the seemingly superior enemy this would require personal courage arthur is reported to have single handedly faced numerically superior enemies name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  both figures are devout s whose victories are attributed to divine protection name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  in both cases the battle of badon seems to be the final victory of a long war bedas states that ambrosius started the war against the saxons and both factions had victories and losses until the war concluded in the battle of badon in arthurian narratives arthur is said to have led the britons in 12 victories with the battle of badon being the last of them name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
korrel admits that there is a significant difference ambrosius both won and lost battles while arthur reportedly never lost a battle but this is probably the difference between a historical figure and one featured in  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
 has suggested ambrosius is identical to  a brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the goths in france around the year 470 fleuriot argues that ambrosius led the britons in the battle in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to  he then returned to britain to continue the war against the saxons name   leoléon fleuriot les origines de la bretagne l’émigration parispayot 1980 p 170 
frank d reno suggests a connection or identification of ambrosius with  this enigmatic character appears historically only in  of  he is not mentioned at all by   the  and the  vortimer does appear in  by  but in a manner suggesting that geoffrey used nennius as a source name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
the historia brittonum features detailed information about vortimer as a warrior king robert huntingdon fletcher was the first to note the similarities between gilas ambrosius and nenniusvortimer he suggested that vortimer practically replaces ambrosius in nennius account ambrosius is also featured by nennius as a powerful leader but he receives only a few minor notices in the text name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  fletcher theorized that gildas text represented a roman faction in britain while nennius drew from an oral and literary legend tradition of a briton faction name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
the difference in names between the two figures may be deceptive vortimer might be not a proper name but an  or a title name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  etymologically the name of vortigern vortimers father seems to derive from vor over and a term for chieftain or king the meaning would be overking similarly vortimer may derive from the older celtic vortamorix in this case vor means over tamo is a   and  means king rix is a cognate to   which has the same meaning name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the meaning of vortimer would be over most king or highest king a synonym for  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
reno agrees with his predecessor scholars that vortimer is an epithet or title of a king mentioned by other names he rejects however a proposed identification of vortigern and vortimer he points that vortigern is last mentioned in the anglo saxon chronicle c 455 as fighting against his former ally  the outcome is not mentioned but the saxon campaigns then continue for decades reno views vortigern as a probable early casualty in the war name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  he suggests that vortimer was an epithet of the succeeding king ambrosius aurelianus name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
it has been suggested that the place name  in  might preserve the name of ambrosius and that perhaps amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century   scholars such as shimon applebaum have found a number of  through the midland dialect regions of britain that incorporate the ambre  element examples include  in   in   in   in gloucestershire and  in west sussex these scholars have claimed this element represents an  word amor the name of a woodland bird however amesbury in wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the midland dialect place names if this etymology is combined with the tradition reported by geoffrey of monmouth stating that ambrosius aurelianus ordered the building of  – which is located within the parish of amesbury and where ambrosius was supposedly buried – and with the presence of an   also in that parish then it may be tempting to connect ambrosius with amesbury

ammonius saccas   fl 3rd century ad was a greek  from  who was often erred to as one of the founders of  he is mainly known as the teacher of  whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243 he was undoubtedly the biggest influence on plotinus in his development of  although little is known about his own philosophical views later  writers stated that ammonius was a christian but it is now generally assumed that there was a different  who wrote biblical texts
not much is known about the life of ammonius saccas

the interpretation that saccas denotes ethnic northern indian origin rather than alluding to gautama buddha supports the possibility that ammonius may have been raised a christian who reverted to paganism as reported by eusebiuseusebius historia eccl vi 9  drawing on porphyrys contra christianos in this case ammonius may have been a second generation indian who remained in contact with the philosophy of his ancestral country the intensity of commerce of goods and ideas between alexandria and india makes this a wholly possible option 
the link to india however is not only consistent with plotinus passion for india but also helps to explain the often noted substantial agreements and shared ideas between vedanta and neoplatonism which are increasingly attributed to direct indian influenceharris r baine ed neoplatonism and indian thought norfolk va 1982  
most details of his life come from the fragments left from s writings the most famous pupil of ammonius saccas was  who studied under ammonius for eleven years according to porphyry in 232 at the age of 28 plotinus went to  to study philosophy
blockquotein his twenty eighth year he plotinus felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in alexandria who then had the highest reputation but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends the friend understanding the desire of his heart sent him to ammonius whom he had not so far tried he went and heard him and said to his friend this is the man i was looking for from that day he stayed continually with ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the indians name porphyry1porphyry life of plotinus from reale g 1990 a history of ancient philosophy iv the schools of the imperial age page 298 suny press  blockquote
according to porphyry the parents of ammonius were  but upon learning greek philosophy ammonius rejected his parents religion for  this conversion is contested by the christian writers  and  who state that ammonius remained a christian throughout his lifetime
blockquoteporphyry plainly utters a falsehood for what will not an opposer of christians do when he says that  ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs  ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life his works yet extant show this as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left name eusebius1eusebius history of the church vi 19  blockquote
however we are told by  that ammonius wrote nothinglonginus quoted by porphyry life of plotinus xx  and if ammonius was the principal influence on plotinus then it is unlikely that ammonius would have been a christian one way to explain much of the confusion concerning ammonius is to assume that there were two people called ammonius ammonius saccas who taught plotinus and an  who wrote biblical texts another explanation might be that there was only one ammonius but that origen who found the neo platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of christianity chose to suppress ammonius choice of paganism over christianity  the insistence of eusebius origens pupil and jerome all of whom were recognized fathers of the christian church that ammonius saccas had not rejected his christian roots would be easier for christians to accept than the assertion of prophyry who was a pagan that ammonius had chosen paganism over christianity
to add to the confusion it seems that ammonius had two pupils called origen  and  name eusebius1  it is quite possible that ammonius saccas taught both origens and since there were two origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later christians to accept that there were two individuals named ammonius one a christian and one a pagan  among ammonius other pupils there were  and 
 writing in the 5th century states that ammonius fundamental doctrine was that  and  were in full agreement with each otherhierocles in photius bibl cod 214 251 
blockquotehe was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority which were a disgrace to philosophy he apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers plato and aristotle and brought them under one and the same  and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples and especially to the best of those acquainted with him plotinus origen and their successorshierocles in photius bibl cod 251 from karamanolis g 2006 plato and aristotle in agreement platonists on aristotle from antiochus to porphyry page 193 oxford university press  blockquote
according to  a  and  c 400  ammonius held that the  was immaterialnemesius on the nature of man ii 
little is known about ammoniuss role in the development of  porphyry seems to suggest that ammonius was instrumental in helping plotinus think about philosophy in new ways
blockquotebut he plotinus did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration and brought the mind of ammonius to bear on the investigation in hand name porphyry1  blockquote
two of ammoniuss students    and    seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to  than neoplatonism which perhaps suggests that ammoniuss doctrines were also closer to those of middle platonism than the neoplatonism developed by plotinus see the  but plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master

the book of amos is a prophetic book of the  one of the   an older contemporary of  and  name  harris understanding the bible palo alto mayfield 1985  was active c 750 bc during the reign of  name harris  786–746 bc making the book of amos the first biblical prophetic book written amos lived in the  but preached in the northern  name harris  his major themes of  gods  and  became staples of prophecy name harris 
amos was a  see  during the reign of jeroboam ben joash  ruler of  from 793 bc to 753 bc and the reign of  king of  at a time when both kingdoms israel in the north and judah in the south were peaking in prosperity he was a contemporary of the prophet  but likely preceded him many of the earlier accounts of prophets found in the  are found within the context of other accounts of israels history amos however is the first prophet whose name also serves as the title of the corresponding biblical book in which his story is found
amos made it a point that before his calling he was a simple  and that he was not a professional prophet of the prophetic guild but modern scholarship points out that he was educated literate and likely an affluent land owner rather than a small shepherd name oyc 
the book was probably updated by later editors who added material concerning the fall of  to the  which had not yet happened in amoss lifetime the passages concerning this event can be distinguished stylistically from the older parts of the text
 prophesied in the days of uzziah king of judah and jeroboam son of joash king of israel this would place his ministry between 767 and 753 bc but a historically verifiable earthquake happened two years after he began to preach and so it is possible to place amoss ministry more precisely between about 765 and 760 bc 
leading up to this time assyrian armies battled against  for a number of years which greatly diminished syrias threat to  as a result of the fighting amongst its neighbors israel had the benefit of increasing its borders almost to those of the time of  and 
it should also be noted that amos preached about two years before a very large earthquake and made erence to it twice in his book   145b remembers this earthquake over 200 years later
some scholars believe that amos message was recorded after he delivered it to the northern kingdom upon returning to his southern homeland of  a town eight kilometres south of  it is mentioned many times in the   1539  149 and 2326 and  1128  is reported to have fortified tekoa along with other cities in  in  115–6
there are some differing opinions as to the location of the tekoa amos was presumably from it is believed by most that amos was a southern farmer who chose to deliver his prophetic message in the north however some believe that amos was actually from a tekoa in the north near  they believe that it is more probable that amos was from the north because it has conditions more suitable for the cultivation of sycamore figs than the tekoa of the south sycamore figs grow at a low elevation lower than the tekoa of judah which is at a relatively high elevation of 850 metres overlooking both  and  others have discredited the theory about the galilean tekoa citing that the difference in elevation between the two locations is not significant scholars in support of the idea of amos being from the north also say it makes more sense because of  accusation of conspiracy found in chapter seven verse 10 a conspirator they argue is more likely to be a national
two other opinions of where amos writings were recorded deserve mention they are that 1 disciples of amos followed him and recorded his message and 2 that someone in his audience in the north recorded his message
amos prophesies in a dramatic tone against common crimes and injustices such as bribery and greed the wealthy elite amos laments are becoming rich at the expense of others peasant farmers who once practiced subsistence farming are being forced to farm what is best for foreign trade mostly wine and oil amos 66 as  has observed the book elevates social justice and morality above cultic practice and ritual observance but unlike later prophets amos does not fully reject the  cult meaning that his views are similar to those of the 
god speaks to amos a farmer and herder and tells him to go to  the capital of the northern kingdom through amos god tells the people that he is going to judge israel for its sins and it will be a foreign nation that will enact his judgment
the people understand judgment as the coming of the day of the  the day of the  was widely celebrated and highly anticipated by the followers of god however amos came to tell the people that the day of the  was coming soon and that it meant divine judgment and justice for their own iniquity
amos is the first prophet to use the term the day of the coogan m a brief introduction to the old testament the hebrew bible in its context oxford university press oxford 2009 p260  this phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature for the people of israel the day of the  is the day when god will fight against his and their enemies and it will be a day of victory for israel however amos and other prophets include israel as an enemy of god as israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent poor and young womencoogan m a brief introduction to the old testament the hebrew bible in its context oxford university press oxford 2009 pp 258–259  to amos the day of the lord will be a day of doom
the book of amos has three major sections plus an epilogueanderson francis i amp david noel freedman amos the anchor yale bible vol 24a new haven yale university press 2008 pages xxv–xlii   chapters one and two look at the nations surrounding  and then israel itself through an ethical lens chapters three to six are a collection of verses that look more specifically at israels transgressions chapters seven to nine include visions that yahweh gave amos as well as amaziahs rebuke of the prophet the last section of the book 71 to 98 commonly erred to as the book of visions contains the only narrative section
in the first two visions  is able to convince god not to act out the scenes of discipline presented to him the ideas of discipline and justice although not enacted here correspond to the central message in what some er to as the book of woes 51 to 614 this message can be seen most clearly in verse 24 of chapter five the plagues in the preceding chapter chapter four were supposed to be seen as acts of discipline that turned israel back to god however the people did not interpret the acts this way and the discipline turned into judgment for the peoples disobedience in the second set of visions 77–9 there is no intercession by amos and god says that he will never pass by them again the plight of israel has become hopeless  will not hold back judgment because israel uses to listen to the prophets and even goes so far as to try to silence them 212 38 710–17
the central idea of the book of amos is that god puts his people on the same level as the surrounding nations – god expects the same purity of them all as it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of god even israel and judah will not be exempt from the judgment of god because of their idolatry and unjust ways the nation that represents yhwh must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of god gods name must be exalted
other major ideas in the book of amos include  and concern for the disadvantaged  the idea that israels  with god did not exempt them from accountability for sin  god is god of all nations  god is judge of all nations  god is god of moral righteousness  god made all people  god elected israel and then liberated israel so that he would be known throughout the world  election by god means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the covenant  if god destroys the unjust a remnant will remain  and god is free to judge whether to redeem israel
the book of amos contains several different key activities and genres which are used to expound upon its themes the following are a few examplesmichael d coogan a brief introduction to the old testament new york oxford 2009 256

the city was not immediately incorporated into the macedonian kingdom and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy the border of macedonia was not moved further east however philip sent a number of macedonian governors to amphipolis and in many respects the city was effectively macedonianized nomenclature the calendar and the currency the  created by philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the pangaion hills replaced the amphipolitan  were all replaced by macedonian equivalents in the reign of  amphipolis was an important naval base and the birthplace of three of the most famous macedonian admirals  androstheneshttps  booksgooglecom booksum 1ampq androsthenes+thasosampbtng search+books  and  whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of amphipolis
the importance of the city in this period is shown by alexander the greats decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing 1500 talents were built alexander prepared for campaigns here against thrace in 335bc and the his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of asia the port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in asia after alexanders death his wife roxane and their small son alexander iv were exiled by  and later murdered here
throughout macedonian sovereignty amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance as shown by inscriptions amphipolis became one of the main stops on the macedonian royal road as testified by a border stone found between  and amphipolis giving the distance to the latter and later on the  the principal  which crossed the southern balkans apart from the ramparts of the lower town the  and a set of well preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible though little is known of the layout of the town modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation including a military ordinance of  and an  law from the gymnasium

the city was probably abandoned in the eighth century as the last bishop was attested in 787 its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient eion port of amphipolis which had been rebuilt and ortified in the   under the name “chrysopolis” this small port continued to enjoy some prosperity before being abandoned during the  the last recorded sign of activity in the region of amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by the  john and the  alexios to protect the land that they had given to the  on

anaximenes of    c 585 – c 528 bce was an    active in the latter half of the 6th century bc name lindberg28lindberg david c “the greeks and the cosmos” the beginnings of western science chicago university of chicago press 2007  28  name grahamgraham daniel w anaximenes the internet encyclopedia of philosophy 29102009 http  wwwieputmedu anaximen  one of the three  philosophers he is identified as a younger friend or student of kirk gs je raven and m schofield  anaximenes of miletus  the presocratic philosophers  cambridge cambridge university press 1984  143  name guthrie115guthrie wkc  the milesians anaximenes  a history of greek philosophy  cambridge cambridge university press 1962 115  anaximenes like others in his school of thought practiced  name lindberg2believed in atheism9lindberg david c the greeks and the cosmos the beginnings of western science chicago university of chicago press 2007  29  name guthrie115  this tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what anaximenes is principally known for today
while his predecessors  and anaximander proposed that the   arche meaning the underlying material of the world were water and the ambiguous substance  respectively anaximenes asserted that air was this primary substance of which all other things are made it should be noted that anaximenes idea of air or aer is more like a dense mist that what we think of as air which is ideally transparent  the choice of air may seem arbitrary but anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of  and guthrie wkc the milesians anaximenes a history of greek philosophy cambridge cambridge university press 1962 116  when air condenses it becomes visible as mist and then rain and other forms of precipitation as the condensed air cools anaximenes supposed that it went on to form earth and ultimately stones in contrast water evaporates into air  can see how he thought that the water disappears   which ignites and produces flame  but what is this supposed to be based on   when further raied name guthrie124guthrie wkc the milesians anaximenes a history of greek philosophy cambridge cambridge university press 1962 124 126   while other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter anaximenes was the first to associate the quality pairs hot dry and cold wet with the density of a single material and add a quantitative dimension to the milesian  name guthrie124 kirk gs je raven and m schofield anaximenes of miletus the presocratic philosophers cambridge cambridge university press 1984 146 
having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air anaximenes used his theory to devise a scheme that explains the origins and nature of the earth and the surrounding celestial bodies  air felted to create the flat disk of the earth which he said was table like and behaved like a leaf floating on air in keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that raied ignited and became the stars while the sun is similarly described as being aflame it is not composed of raied air like the stars but rather of earth like the moon its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motionkirk gs je raven and m schofield anaximenes of miletus the presocratic philosophers cambridge cambridge university press 1984  152 153  similarly he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air in his theory when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head name graham fairbanks arthur http  peoplecsuchicagoedu ~simon teach 28000 davisuniversalpdf anaximenes the first philosophers of greece k paul trench trübner 1898 20 
anaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well  he asserted were the result either of lack of moisture which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is or of superabundance of water which also causes cracks in the earth in either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks so that hills collapse and cause earthquakes  is similarly caused by the violent separation of clouds by the wind creating a bright fire like flash  on the other hand are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sunfairbanks arthur  http  peoplecsuchicagoedu ~simon teach 28000 davisuniversalpdf anaximenes the first philosophers of greece k paul trench trübner 1898 1820 21   these examples show how anaximenes like the other  looked for the broader picture in nature they sought unifying causes for diversely occurring events rather than treating each one on a case by case basis or attributing them to gods or to a personified  name lindberg2believed in atheism9

andocides http  wwwinfopleasecom encyclopedia people andocideshtml andocides  6th ed columbia university press 2012   andokides c 440 – c 390 bc was a  speech writer in ancient greece  he was one of the ten  included in the alexandrian canon compiled by  and  in the third century bc
andocides was the son of leogoras and was born in  around 440 bcebrills new pauly vandocides  he belonged to the ancient  family of the  who traced their lineage up to  and the god  name pseudo   name pa alcibiades 21 andocides de mysteriis § 141 andocides de reditu § 26  
in his youth he seems to have been employed on various occasions as ambassador to      and andocides contra alcibiadem § 41  and although he was frequently attacked for his political opinionsandocides contra alcibiadem § 8  he maintained his ground until in  when he became involved in the charge brought against  for having profaned the mysteries and mutilated the  on the eve of the departure of the  against  it appeared particularly likely that andocides was an accomplice in the latter of these crimes which was believed to be a preliminary step towards overthrowing the democratic constitution since the herm standing close to his house in the  aegeis was among the very few which had not been injured alcibiades 3 jan otto sluiter lectiones andocideae c 3 
andocides was accordingly seized and thrown into prison but after some time recovered his freedom by a promise that he would turn informer and reveal the names of the real perpetrators of the crime and on the suggestion of one charmides or timaeusandocides de mysteriis § 48  name pa  he mentioned four all of whom were put to death he is said to have also denounced his own father on the charge of profaning the mysteries but to have rescued him again in the hour of danger   a charge he strenuously deniedandocides de mysteriis  but as andocides was unable to clear himself from the charge he was deprived of his rights as a citizen and left athensandocides de reditu § 25 
he now traveled about in various parts of greece and was chiefly engaged in commercial enterprise and in forming connections with powerful peopleandocides de mysteriis § 137  the means he employed to gain the friendship of powerful men were sometimes of the most disreputable kind among which a service he rendered to a prince in  is mentioned in particular name phot  
in  andocides returned to athens on the establishment of the  government of the  hoping that a certain service  he had rendered the athenian ships at samos would secure him a welcome receptionandocides de reditu §§ 1112  but no sooner were the oligarchs informed of the return of andocides than their leader  had him seized and accused him of having supported the party opposed to them at samos during his trial andocides who perceived the exasperation prevailing against him leaped to the altar which stood in the court and there assumed the attitude of a supplicant this saved his life but he was imprisoned soon afterwards however he was set free or escaped from prisonandocides de reditu § 15  name lysias29 against andocides § 29 
andocides now went to cyprus where for a time he enjoyed the friendship of  but by some circumstance or other he exasperated his friend and was consigned to prison here again he escaped and after the restoration of democracy in athens and the abolition of the four hundred he ventured once more to return to athens but as he was still suffering under a sentence of civil disenfranchisement he endeavored by means of bribes to persuade the  to allow him to attend the assembly of the people the latter however expelled him from the city name lysias29  it was on this occasion  that andocides delivered the speech still extant on his return on which he petitioned for permission to reside at athens but in vain in his third exile andocides went to reside in  name phot  and during the time of his absence from his native city his house there was occupied by  the leading andocides de mysteriis § 146 
andocides remained in exile until after the overthrow of the tyranny of  by  when the general amnesty then proclaimed made him hope that its benefit would be extended to him also he himself says that he returned to athens from cyprusandocides de mysteriis § 132  where he claimed to have great influence and considerable propertyandocides de mysteriis § 4  because of the general amnesty he was allowed to remain at athens enjoyed peace for the next three years and soon recovered an influential position according to  it was scarcely ten days after his return that he brought an accusation against  or  which however he dropped on receiving a sum of money during this period andocides became a member of the  in which he appears to have possessed a great influence as well as in the popular assembly he was  at the  was sent as  to the  and  and was even entrusted with the office of keeper of the sacred treasury
but in   supported by    and  urged the necessity of preventing andocides from attending the assembly as he had never been formally freed from the civil disenfranchisement callias also charged him with violating the laws respecting the temple at andocides de mysteriis § 110  the orator pleaded his case in the oration still extant on the mysteries περὶ τῶν μυστηρίων in which he argued that he had not been involved in the profanation of the mysteries or the mutilation of the herms that he had not violated the laws of the temple at eleusis that anyway he had received his citizenship back as a result of the amnesty and that callias was really motivated by a private dispute with andocides over inheritance he was acquitted after this he again enjoyed peace until  he was sent as ambassador to  respecting the peace to be concluded in consequence of s victory off  on his return he was accused of illegal conduct during his embassy the speech on the peace with the lacedaemons περὶ τῆς πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους εἰρήνης which is still extant ers to this affair it was delivered in  though some scholars place it in  andocides was found guilty and sent into exile for the fourth time he never returned afterwards and seems to have died soon after this blow
andocides appears to have fathered no children since he is described at the age of 70 as being childlessandocides de mysteriis §§ 146148  although the  on  mentions  as a son of andocides the large fortune which he had inherited from his father or acquired in his commercial undertakings was greatly diminished in the latter years of his lifeandocides de mysteriis § 144  against andocides § 31 
as an orator andocides does not appear to have been held in very high esteem by the ancients as he is seldom mentioned though  is said to have written a commentary on his orations sv Θέων  we do not hear of his having been trained in any of the sophistical schools of the time and he had probably developed his talents in the practical school of the popular assembly hence his orations have no mannerism in them and are really as plutarch says simple and free from all rhetorical pomp and ornamentcomp dionys hal de lys 2 de thucyd jud 51 
sometimes however his style is diffuse and becomes tedious and obscure the best among his orations is that on the mysteries but for the history of the time all are of the highest importance
besides the three orations already mentioned which are undoubtedly genuine there is a fourth against alcibiades κατὰ Ἀλκιβιάδου said to have been delivered by andocides during the  of  but it is probably spurious though it appears to contain genuine historical matter some scholars ascribed it to  who took part in the ostracism according to plutarch but it is more likely that it is a rhetorical exercise from the early fourth century bc since formal speeches were not delivered during ostracisms and the accusation or defence of alcibiades was a standing rhetorical themegribble 1999 alcibiades and athens ch2 app2  besides these four orations we possess only a few fragments and some very vague allusions to other orationsjan otto sluiter lectiones andocideae p 239 ampc

when the  or royal servants rose up andrew was forced to issue the  confirming their privileges this led to the rise of the  his  of 1224 listed the liberties of the  community the employment of  and  to administer the royal revenues led him into conflict with the  and the hungarian s andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non christian officials in 1233 but he never fulfilled the latter promise
andrews first wife  was murdered in 1213 because her blatant favoritism towards her german kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords the veneration of their daughter  was confirmed by the holy see during andrews lifetime after andrews death his sons  and  accused his third wife  of adultery and never considered her son  to be a legitimate son of andrew
andrew was the second son of king  and bélas first wife  the year of andrews birth is not known but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177 andrew was first mentioned in connection to his fathers invasion of the  in 1188 that year béla iii invaded halych upon the request of its former prince  who had been expelled by his subjects béla forced the new prince  to flee after conquering halych he granted it to andrew béla also captured vladimir yaroslavich and imprisoned him in hungary
after bélas withdrawal from halych roman mstislavich returned with the assistance of  prince of  they tried to expel andrew and his hungarian retinue but the hungarians routed the united forces of mstislavich and rostislavich a group of local s offered the throne to rostislav ivanovich a distant cousin of the imprisoned vladimir yaroslavich béla iii sent reinforcements to halych enabling andrews troops to repel the attacks andrews reign remained unpopular in halych because the hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect  churches consequently the local boyars allied with their former prince vladimir yaroslavich who had escaped from captivity and returned to halych duke  also supported vladimir yaroslavich and they expelled andrew and his retinue from the principality in august 1189 or 1190 andrew returned to hungary after his defeat he did not receive a separate duchy from his father who only gave him estates and money on his deathbed béla iii who had pledged to lead a  to the  ordered andrew to fulfill his vow andrews father died on 23 april 1196 and andrews older brother  succeeded him

king emeric died on 30 november 1204 andrew governed the kingdom as ladislauss regent but he counted his regnal years from the time of his brothers death showing that he already regarded himself as the lawful monarch during ladislaus iiis reign pope innocent told andrew that he should remain loyal to ladislaus instead andrew seized the money that emeric had deposited for ladislaus in  ladislauss mother  fled from hungary taking her son to  andrew prepared to war against  but ladislaus suddenly died in  on 7 may 1205
 crowned andrew king in  on 29 may 1205 andrew introduced a new policy for royal grants which he called new institutions in one of his charters he distributed large portions of the royal domainroyal castles and all estates attached to themas inheritable grants to his supporters declaring that the best measure of a royal grant is its being immeasurable his new institutions altered the relations between the monarchs and the hungarian lords during the previous two centuries a lords status primarily depended on the income he received for his services to the monarch after the introduction of the new institutions their inheritable estates yielded sufficient revenues this policy also diminished the funds upon which the authority of the s or heads of the who were appointed by the monarchshad been based
during his reign andrew was intensely interested in the internal affairs of his former principality of halych he launched his first campaign to recapture halych in 1205 or 1206 upon the boyars request he intervened against   and his allies on behalf of  the child prince of halych and  svyatoslavich and his allies were forced to withdraw andrew adopted the title of king of galicia and lodomeria demonstrating his claim to suzerainty in the two principalities 
after andrew returned to hungary vsevolod svyatoslavichs distant cousin  seized both halych and lodomeria expelling daniel romanovich and his mother they fled to   who suggested that they visit andrew however vladimir igorevich sent many gifts to both andrew and leszek dissuading them from attacking himthe hypatian codex ii the galician volynian chronicle year 1207 p 19  on behalf of romanovich according to the  vladimir igorevichs rebellious brother  soon came to hungary seeking andrews assistance roman returned to halych and expelled vladimir igorevich with the help of hungarian auxiliary troops
andrew confirmed the liberties of two dalmatian towns and and issued a new charter listing the privileges of the  in 1207 taking advantage of a conflict between roman igorevich and his boyars andrew sent troops to halych under the command of  benedict captured roman igorevich and occupied the principality in 1208 or 1209 instead of appointing a new prince andrew made benedict governor of halych benedict tortured boyars and was addicted to lecherythe hypatian codex ii the galician volynian chronicle year 1210 p 20  according to the galician–volhynian chronicle the boyars offered the throne to   if he could overthrow benedict mstislav mstislavich invaded halych but he could not defeat benedict
queen gertrudes two brothers ekbert  and henry ii margrave of istria fled to hungary in 1208 after they were accused of participating in the murder of   andrew granted large domains to bishop ekbert in the  region now  slovakia gertrudes youngest brother  had been  since 1206 he was made  and  in 1209 andrews generosity towards his wifes german relatives and courtiers discontented the local lords according to historian gyula kristó the  of  erred to the germans from the  when he sarcastically mentioned that  the romans gaze on the goods of hungaryanonymus notary of king béla the deeds of the hungarians ch 9 p 27  in 1209  which  was liberated by one of andrews dalmatian vassals  but the venetians recaptured the town a year later
roman igorevich reconciled with his brother vladimir igorevich in early 1209 or 1210 their united forces vanquished benedicts army expelling the hungarians from halych vladimir igorevich sent one of his sons vsevolod vladimirovich bearing gifts to the king in hungarythe hypatian codex ii the galician volynian chronicle year 1211 p 20  to appease andrew according to the galician–volhynian chronicle a group of discontented hungarian lords offered the crown to andrews cousins the sons of andrews uncle  they lived in greek land however the cousins envoys were captured in split in 1210 in the early 1210s andrew sent an army of    and  commanded by joachim  now  romania to assist s fight against three rebellious  chieftains around the same time hungarian troops occupied belgrade and  now braničevo serbia which had been lost to bulgaria under emeric andrews army defeated the cumans at  andrew granted the  now  romania to the  the knights were to defend the easternmost regions of the kingdom of hungary against the cumans and encourage their conversion to catholicism
a group of boyars who were alarmed by the despotic acts of vladimir igorevich asked andrew to restore daniel romanovich as ruler of halych in 1210 or 1211 andrew and his alliesleszek i of poland and at least five rus princessent their armies to halych and restored daniel romanovich local boyars expelled daniel romanovichs mother in 1212 she persuaded andrew to personally lead his army to halych he captured volodislav kormilchich the most influential boyar and took him to hungary after andrew withdrew from halych the boyars again offered the throne to mstislav mstislavich who expelled daniel romanovich and his mother from the principality andrew departed for a new campaign against halych in summer 1213 during his absence hungarian lords who were aggrieved at queen gertrudes favoritism towards her german entourage captured and murdered her and many of her courtiers in the  on 28 september when he heard of her murder andrew returned to hungary and ordered the execution of the murderer  however peters accomplices including   did not receive severe punishments a group of hungarian lords whom andrew called perverts in one of his letters was plotting to dethrone andrew and crown his eldest son the eight year old  but they failed to dethrone him and could only force andrew to consent to bélas coronation in 1214
andrew and leszek of poland signed a treaty of alliance which obliged andrews second son  to marry leszek of polands daughter  andrew and leszek jointly invaded halych in 1214 and coloman was made prince he agreed to cede  to leszek of poland the following year andrew returned to halych and captured  leszek of poland soon reconciled with mstislav mstislavich they jointly invaded halych and forced coloman to flee to hungary a new officer of state the  was responsible for the administration of the royal chamber from around 1214 onwards however royal revenues had significantly diminished upon the advice of the treasurer  andrew imposed new taxes and   from minting salt trade and custom duties the yearly exchange of coins also produced more revenue for the royal chamber however these measures provoked discontent in hungary
andrew signed a new treaty of alliance with leszek of poland in the summer of 1216 leszek and andrews son coloman invaded halych and expelled mstislav mstislavich and daniel romanovich after which coloman was restored that same year andrew met   in  now  serbia he persuaded stephen nemanjić to negotiate with   who was the uncle of andrews second wife  stephen nemanjić was crowned king of serbia in 1217 andrew planned to invade serbia but stephen nemanjićs brother  dissuaded him according to both versions of the life of sava
in july 1216 the newly elected  once again called upon andrew to fulfill his fathers vow to lead a crusade andrew who had postponed the crusade at least three times in 1201 1209 and 1213 finally agreed  tibor almási and other modern historians say that andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as latin emperor of constantinople because his wifes uncle emperor henry had died in june according to a letter written by pope honorius in 1217 envoys from the  had actually informed andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father in law  as emperor the barons of the latin empire elected peter of courtenay in the summer of 1216
andrew sold and mortgaged royal estates to finance his campaign which became part of the wider  he renounced his claim to zadar in favor of the republic of venice so that he could secure shipping for his army he entrusted hungary to archbishop john of esztergom and gave croatia and dalmatia to  the  prior of vrana in july 1217 andrew departed from  accompanied by  and  his army was so largeat least 10000 mounted soldiers and uncountable infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when andrew and his men embarked in split two months later the ships transported them to  where they landed in october
the leaders of the crusade included   leopold of austria the  the  and the  they held a war council in acre with andrew leading the meeting in early november the crusaders launched a campaign for the  forcing   to withdraw without fighting the crusaders then pillaged  after the crusaders returned to acre andrew did not participate in any other military actions instead he was collecting s including a water jug allegedly used at the  the heads of  and  the right hands of the apostles  and  and a part of  if thomas the archdeacons report of certain evil and audacious men in acre who treacherously passed him a poisoned drink name autogenerated165archdeacon thomas of split history of the bishops of salona and split ch 25 p 165  is reliable andrews inactivity was because of illness
andrew decided to return home at the very beginning of 1218 even though   threatened him with excommunication andrew first visited  and participated in the marriage of  and  on 10 january from tripoli he travelled to  where he and  betrothed andrews youngest son  and leos daughter  andrew proceeded through the   before arriving in  now  turkey his cousins the sons of his uncle géza attacked him when he was in nicaea he arranged the marriage of his oldest son béla to  a daughter of emperor  when he arrived in bulgaria andrew was detained until he gave full surety that his daughter would be united in marriage name autogenerated165  to  according to thomas the archdeacon andrew returned to hungary in late 1218 andrews crusade had achieved nothing and brought him no honor according to historian thomas c van cleve oliver of padernborn  and other 13th century authors blamed andrew for the failure of crusade
when he returned to hungary andrew complained to pope honorius that his kingdom was in a miserable and destroyed state deprived of all of its revenues  a group of barons had even expelled archbishop john from hungary andrew was in massive debt because of his crusade which forced him to impose extraordinarily high taxes and debase coinage in 1218 or 1219 mstislav mstislavich invaded halych and captured andrews son coloman andrew compromised with mstislavich coloman was released and andrews youngest son and namesake was betrothed to mstislavichs daughter in 1220 a group of lords persuaded andrew to make his eldest son béla the duke of croatia dalmatia and slavonia
andrew employed  and  to administer royal revenues which caused a discord between andrew and the holy see starting in the early 1220s pope honorius urged andrew and queen yolanda to prohibit muslims from employing christians andrew confirmed the privileges of clergymen including their exemption from taxes and  but also prohibited the  of   and other serfs in early 1222 however a new conflict emerged between andrew and the holy see after he persuaded béla to separate from his wife maria laskarina an immense crowd approached andrew around june 1222 demanding grave and unjust things according to a letter of pope honorius  actually the who were landowners directly subject to the monarchs power and obliged to fight in the royal armyassembled forcing andrew to dismiss  and his other officials andrew was also forced issue a royal charter the  the charter summarized the liberties of the royal servants including their exemption from taxes and the jurisdiction of the s the last clause of the golden bull authorized the bishops as well as the other barons and nobles of the realm singularly and in common to resist the monarch if he did not honor the provisions of the charter the golden bull clearly distinguished the royal servants from the kings other subjects which led to the rise of the   the golden bull is commonly compared with englands  — a similar charter which was sealed a few years earlier in 1215  a significant difference between them is that in england the settlement strengthened the position of all the royal subjects but in hungary the aristocracy came to dominate both the crown and the lower orders
andrew discharged palatine  and restored julius kán in the second half of 1222 the following year pope honorius urged andrew to launch a new crusade if the report of the continuatio claustroneuburgensis is reliable andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade but no other sources mention this event andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son béla but pope honorius mediated a reconciliation between béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223 this angered andrew and béla fled to austria he returned in 1224 after the bishops persuaded andrew to forgive him
in his  of 1224 andrew confirmed the privileges of the  who inhabited the region of  in southern transylvania now  romania the following year he launched a campaign against the teutonic knights who had attempted to eliminate his suzerainty the knights were forced to leave  and the neighboring lands andrews envoys and leopold vi of austria signed a treaty on 6 june which ended the armed conflicts along the hungarian austrian border as part of the treaty leopold vi paid an indemnification for the damages that his troops had caused in hungary andrew made his oldest son béla  bélas former duchy was given to andrews second son coloman in 1226 duke béla started expanding his suzerainty over the  who inhabited the lands east of the carpathian mountains andrew launched a campaign against mstislav mstislavich in 1226 because the latter used to grant halych to andrews youngest son despite a previous compromise andrew besieged and captured   and other fortresses in halych however his troops were routed at  and zvenigorod forcing him to withdraw despite his victories mstislavich ceded halych to andrews son in early 1227
in 1228 andrew authorized his son béla to revise his previous land grants pope honorius also supported bélas efforts béla confiscated the domains of two noblemen  and bánk bár kalán who had taken part in the conspiracy to murder queen gertrude in 1229 upon bélas proposal andrew confirmed the privileges of the cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to béla  made a complaint about andrew to the holy see because andrew continued to employ jews and muslims  authorized the archbishop to perform acts of religious censure to persuade andrew to dismiss his non christian officials under duress andrew issued a new golden bull in 1231 which confirmed that muslims were banned from employment and empowered the archbishop of esztergom to excommunicate the king if he failed to honor the provisions of the new golden bull in the second half of the year andrew invaded halych and restored his youngest son andrew to the throne
archbishop robert excommunicated palatine denis and put hungary under an  on 25 february 1232 because the employment of jews and muslims continued despite the golden bull of 1231 since the archbishop accused the muslims of persuading andrew to seize church property andrew restored properties to the archbishop who soon suspended the interdict upon andrews demand pope gregory sent cardinal  as his legate to hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the popes special authorization although andrew departed for halych to support his youngest son in a fight against daniel romanivich he continued his negotiations with the papal legate on 20 august 1233 in the forests of  he vowed that he would not employ jews and muslims to administrate royal revenues and would pay 10000 marks as compensation for usurped church revenues andrew repeated his oath in  in september
andrew and  signed a peace treaty in late 1233 andrew who had been widowed married the 23 year old  on 14 may 1234 even though his sons were sharply opposed to his third marriage john bishop of bosnia put hungary under a new interdict in the first half of 1234 because andrew had not dismissed his non christian officials despite his oath of bereg andrew and archbishop robert of esztergom protested against the bishops act at the holy see
danilo romanovich laid siege to halych and andrews youngest son died during the siege in the autumn of 1234 however andrew stormed austria in the summer of 1235 forcing duke frederick to pay an indemnification for damages that his troops had caused while raiding hungary upon andrews demand pope gregory declared on 31 august that andrew and his sons could only be excommunicated by the authorization of the holy see andrew died on 21 september and was buried in

an enquiry concerning human understanding is a book by the scottish    published in english in 1748see  via google books  it was a revision of an earlier effort humes  published anonymously in  in 173940 hume was disappointed with the reception of the treatise which fell dead born from the presshume david 1776 my own life appendix a of  the life of david hume university of texas press 1954  as he put it and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work
the end product of his labours was the enquiry the enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the treatise in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects for example humes views on  do not appear however more vital propositions such as humes argument for the role of  in a theory of knowledge are retained
this book has proven highly influential both in the years that would immediately follow and today   points to it as the book which woke him from his self described dogmatic slumberi    the enquiry is widely regarded as a classic in  literature
the argument of the enquiry proceeds by a series of incremental steps separated into chapters which logically succeed one another after expounding his  hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics
 
in the first section of the enquiry hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole for hume philosophy can be split into two general parts natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature or as he calls it moral philosophy the latter investigates both actions and thoughts he emphasizes in this section by way of warning that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion however he insists precision helps art and craft of all kinds including the craft of philosophy
 
next hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas by impressions he means sensations while by ideas he means memories and imaginings according to hume the difference between the two is that ideas are less vivacious than impressions for example the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression or sensation of actually eating one writing within the tradition of  he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas
hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensationin lockes terminology this was known as the division between simple and complex ideas of sense  according to hume the creative faculty makes use of at least four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense impressions these operations are compounding or the addition of one idea onto another such as a horn on a horse to create a  transposing or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a  augmenting as with the case of a  whose size has been augmented and diminishing as with  whose size has been diminished hume 1974317 in a later chapter he also mentions the operations of mixing separating and dividing hume 1974340 
however hume admits that there is one objection to his account the problem of  in this thought experiment he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one see fig 1 he predicts that this man will be able to divide the color of this particular shade of blue despite the fact that he has never experienced it this seems to pose a serious problem for the empirical account though hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions hume 1974319
 
in this chapter hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences as in trains of thought he explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas resemblance contiguity in space time and cause and effect he argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas however he does not immediately show what this principle might be hume 1974320 321
 
in the first part hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either relations of ideas or matters of fact which is roughly the  between  and  the former he tells the reader are proved by demonstration while the latter are given through experience hume 1974322 in explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through  reasoning for hume every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily—they are entirely distinct from one another hume 1974324
in part two hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world
when it is asked what is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact the proper answer seems to be that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect when again it is asked what is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation it may be replied in one word experience but if we still carry on our sifting humor and ask what is the foundation of all conclusions from experience this implies a new question which may be of more difficult solution and explication hume 1974328
he shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration since it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change nor experience since that would be a  hume 1974330 332 here he is describing what would become known as the 
 
for hume we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of habit or custom which human nature forces us to take seriously this is also presumably the principle that organizes the connections between ideas indeed one of the many famous passages of the inquiry was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom in a later chapter he wrote
the great subverter of pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action and employment and the occupations of common life these principles may flourish and triumph in the schools where it is indeed difficult if not impossible to ute them but as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real objects which actuate our passions and sentiments are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals hume 1974425
in the second part he provides an account of beliefs he explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesnt hume 1974340
 
this short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance for him probability means a higher chance of occurring and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer by chance he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience however further experience takes these equal chances and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others these gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes this effect may be understood as another case of custom or habit taking past experience and using it to predict the future hume 1974346 348
 
by necessary connection hume means the power or force which necessarily ties one idea to another he rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined since that would mean we could know something prior to experience unlike his predecessors berkeley and locke hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of some sense of the power of the will he reasons that 1 if we knew the nature of this power then the mind body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us 2 if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies eg our hands or tongues and not others eg the liver or heart 3 we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action eg of the muscles and nerves and animal spirits which are the immediate cause of an action hume 1974353 354 he produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone hume 1974355 356 he also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere  a view associated with the philosopher  hume 1974356 359
having dispensed with these alternative explanations he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances in this way people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will hume 1974361
 
here hume tackles the problem of how  may be reconciled with metaphysical  otherwise known as a  formulation of  hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments—that is to say arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions he first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic but human actions are more controversial however he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system to show the compatibility of  necessity and liberty hume defines liberty as the ability to act on the basis of ones will eg the capacity to will ones actions but not to will ones will he then shows quite briefly how determinism and free will are compatible notions and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life
 
hume insists that the conclusions of the enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans he believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do through learned expectations hume 1974384 he also notes that this inferential ability that animals have is not through reason but custom alone hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share namely the ability to reason experimentally through custom nevertheless he admits humans and animals differ in mental faculties in a number of ways including differences in memory and attention inferential abilities ability to make deductions in a long chain ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances a sagely prudence which arrests generalizations a capacity for a greater inner library of analogies to reason with an ability to detach oneself and scrap ones own biases and an ability to converse through language and thus gain from the experience of others testimonies hume 1974385 footnote 17
 
the next topic which hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony and of the role that  this was not an idle concern for hume depending on its outcome the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles
true to his empirical thesis hume tells the reader that though testimony does have some force it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses that said he provides some reasons why we may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons because a human memory can be relatively tenacious and b because people are inclined to tell the truth and ashamed of telling falsities needless to say these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience hume 1974389
and there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony also based on experience if a testimonies conflict one another b there are a small number of witnesses c the speaker has no integrity d the speaker is overly hesitant or bold or e the speaker is known to have motives for lying then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speakers claims hume 1974390
there is one final criterion that hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony and that is f if the propositions being communicated are miraculous hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature he argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them and are so well demonstrated to everyones experience that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence hume 1974391 392
moreover he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity for four reasons first he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts second he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others third he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism finally since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous—that is one mans religious miracle may be contradicted by another mans miracle—any testimony relating to the fantastic is self denunciating hume 1974393 398
still hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform however he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity thus if every historian were to claim that there was a solar eclipse in the year 1600 then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws wed come to accept it as a fact but if every historian were to assert that queen elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead then wed have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation hume 1974400 402
 
hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell the brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions not of hume but of one of humes anonymous friends who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher  his friend argues that though it is possible to  it is not possible to infer unseen effects from a cause thus traced the friend insists then that even though we might postulate that there is a first cause behind all things—god—we cant infer anything about the afterlife because we dont know anything of the afterlife from experience and we cant infer it from the existence of god hume 1974408
hume offers his friend an objection if we see an unfinished building then cant we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions and that it will be finished in the future his friend concurs but indicates that there is a relevant disanalogy that we cant pretend to know the contents of the mind of god while we can know the designs of other humans hume seems essentially persuaded by his friends reasoning hume 1974412 414
 
the first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments the treatment includes the arguments of atheism cartesian skepticism light skepticism and rationalist critiques of empiricism hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which   while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable   may only be combated through the non philosophical adherence to custom or habit he ends the section with his own reservations towards cartesian and lockean epistemologies
in the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it
for here is the chief and most confounding objection to excessive skepticism that no durable good can ever result from it while it remains in its full force and vigor we need only ask such a skeptic what his meaning is and what he proposes by all these curious researches he is immediately at a loss and knows not what to answer a pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind or if it had that its influence would be beneficial to society on the contrary he must acknowledge if he will acknowledge anything that all human life must perish were his principles universally and steadily to prevail hume 1974426
he concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number no does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusionhume d enquiries concerning human understanding and concerning the principles of morals reprinted from 1777 edition third edition l a selby bigge ed clarendon press oxford sect xii part iii p165 
the criteria hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology under the rubric of the communication persuasion paradigm supporting literature includes the work of  which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator  in different kinds of persuasion and examinations of the worthiness of the speaker
the custom view of learning can in many ways be likened to  psychology this point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century still testing on the subject has been somewhat divided testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect however it has been shown that some animals like chimpanzees were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals and thus would seem to have a causal insight which transcends mere customkohler wolfgang 1925 the mentality of apes new york harcourt cited from passer michael et al 2003 psychology frontiers and applications first canadian edition mcgraw hill toronto p 267

andré de longjumeau also known as andrew of longjumeau in english was a 13th century  missionary and diplomat and one of the most active occidental diplomats in the east in the 13th century he led two embassies to the  the first carried letters from  and the second bore gifts and letters from  to  well acquainted with the  he spoke  and  thought to be either  or  name   mxpvnkroux les explorateurs p96 
andrews first mission to the east was when he was asked by the french king  to go and fetch the  which had been sold to him by the latin emperor of   in 1238 who was anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire name   mxpvnk  andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother jacques
andrew of longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the mongols by  he left  in the spring of 1245 for the gregory g guzman simon of saint quentin and the dominican mission to the mongol baiju a reappraisal speculum vol 46 no 2 april 1971 p 235  
he visited muslim principalities in  and representatives of the  and  churches in persia finally delivering the papal correspondence to a mongol general near  papal envoys to the great khans stanford university press 1971 p 113  in tabriz andré de longjumeau met with a monk from the  named  who had been put in charge by the  of protecting the christians in the richard histoire des croisades p376 
at the mongol camp near  andrew had met a certain  who in december 1248 appeared at the court of king  in  andrew who was now with saint louis interpreted davids message to the king a real or pretended offer of alliance from the mongol general  and a proposal of a joint attack upon the islamic powers of 
in reply to this the french sovereign dispatched andrew as his ambassador to  with longjumeau went his brother william also a dominican and several others — john goderiche john of carcassonne herbert le  gerbert of sens robert a clerk a certain william and an unnamed clerk of 
the party set out on 27 january 1249 with letters from king louis and the  and rich presents including a chapel tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures from cyprus they went to the port of  in syria and thence traveled for a year to the khans court going ten leagues 5556 kilometers per day their route led them through  along the southern and eastern shores of the  and certainly through  north east of 
on arrival at the supreme mongol court — either that on the  near  and the present russo chinese frontier in the  or more probably at or near  itself south west of  — andrew found güyük khan dead poisoned as the envoy supposed by s agents the regent mother  the camus of  seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for louis ix but it is certain that before the friar had quit tartary  güyüks successor had been elected
andrews report to his sovereign whom he rejoined in 1251 at  in  appears to have been a mixture of history and fable the latter affects his narrative of the mongols rise to greatness and the struggles of their leader  with  it is still more evident in the position assigned to the  homeland close to the prison of  on the other hand the envoys account of mongol customs is fairly accurate and his statements about  and its prosperity though perhaps exaggerated eg as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host are based on fact
mounds of bones marked his road witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail he found christian prisoners from germany in the heart of tartary at talas and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires as a bringer of gifts to a dead  gifts which were of course treated by the mongols as evidence of submission this insulting behaviour and the language of the letter with which andrew reappeared marked the mission a failure king louis says  se repenti fort felt very sorry
andrew died some time after 1253 while he was active as a missionary in palestine the  missionary  in his work on asian customs declares that everything he had heard from andrew on the subject was fully borne out by his own personal observations

andronikos i komnenos  ampnbsp september 12 1185 usually  as andronicus i comnenus was  from 1183 to 1185 he was the son of  and the grandson of the emperor 
andronikos komnenos was born around 1118 he was handsome and eloquent active hardy courageous a great general and an able politician but also licentious his early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service
in 1141 he was taken captive by the  and remained in their hands for a year on being ransomed he went to  where he was held at the court of his cousin the emperor  to whom he was a great favourite here the charms of his niece eudoxia attracted him and she became his mistress in 1152 accompanied by eudoxia he set out for an important command in   in his principal enterprise an attack upon  he returned but was again appointed to the command of a province  this second post he seems also to have left after a short interval for he appeared again in constantinople and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of eudoxia
about 1153 a conspiracy against the emperor in which andronikos participated was discovered and he was thrown in prison after repeated unsuccessful attempts he escaped in 1165 after passing through many dangers including captivity in  territory he reached  where his cousin  of  held court while under the protection of yaroslav andronikos formed an alliance with the emperor manuel i and with a  army he joined manuel in the invasion of  assisting at the siege of  the campaign was successful and andronikos returned to constantinople with manuel i in 1168 a year later however andronikos used to take the oath of allegiance to the future king  whom manuel desired to become his successor andronikos was removed from court but received the province of 
still under the displeasure of the emperor andronikos fled to the court of   while residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince  sister of the empress  the emperor was again angered by this dishonour and andronikos was compelled to flee he took uge with king  whose favour he gained and who invested him with the  in jerusalem he saw  the beautiful widow of king  and niece of the emperor manuel although andronikos was at that time fifty six years old age had not diminished his charms and theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction to avoid the vengeance of the emperor she fled with andronikos to the court of  the  feeling unsafe there they continued their perilous journey through the  and  they were well received by king  whose anonymous sister had probably been the first wife of andronikos
andronikos was granted estates in  in the east of georgia in 1173 or 1174 he accompanied the georgian army on an expedition to  up to the  shores where george recaptured the fortress of shabaran from the invaders from  for his cousin the   finally andronikos and theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the komnenoi at  on the shores of the  between  and speros vryonis jr the decline of medieval hellenism in asia minor and the process of islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century berkeley university of california 1971 p 127  while andronikos was on one of his incursions into trebizond his castle was surprised by the governor of that province and theodora and her two children were captured and sent to constantinople to obtain their release andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the emperor and appearing in chains before him besought pardon this he obtained and he was allowed to retire with theodora into banishment at oinaion
in 1180 the emperor manuel died and was succeeded by his ten year old son  who was under the guardianship of his mother empress maria her latin origins and culture led to creeping resentment from her greek subjects they had felt insulted by the western tastes of manuel and being ruled by his western wife built tensions to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war this gave andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to constantinople with an army that according to non byzantine sources included muslim contingents

  the defection of the commander of the byzantine navy   and the general andronikos angelos played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter constantinople
the arrival of andronikos komnenos was soon followed by a  who virtually controlled its economy resulting in the deaths of thousands of westerners he was believed to have arranged the poisoning of alexios iis elder sister  and her husband  although maria herself had encouraged him to intervene the poisoner was said to be the  pterygeonites soon afterwards andronikos had the empress maria imprisoned and then killed — forcing a signature from the child emperor alexius to put his mother to death — by pterygeonites and the  constantine tripsychos alexios ii was compelled to acknowledge andronikos as colleague in the empire in front of the crowd on the terrace of the  and was then quickly put to death in turn the killing was carried out by tripsychos theodore dadibrenos and  histories pp 260–274 van dieten 
in 1183 andronikos married twelve year old   daughter of king  and his third wife  — agnes had been betrothed to alexios ii by november 1183 andronikos had associated his younger legitimate son john komnenos on the throne in 1184 a venetian embassy visited constantinople and an agreement was reached that compensation of 1500 gold pieces would be paid for the losses incurred in 1171
the reign of andronikos was characterized by his harsh measures he resolved to suppress many abuses but above all things to check  and limit the power of the nobles who were rivals for his throne the people who felt the severity of his laws at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of manuel is rule andronikos became increasingly paranoid and violent however and the empire descended into a terror state in september 1185 he ordered the execution of all prisoners exiles and their families for collusion with the invaders the aristocrats in turn were infuriated against him and there were several revolts
the stories of chaos led to an invasion by king  of the norman sicilians william landed in  with a strong force of 200 ships and 80000 men including 5000 knights and marched as far as  which he  ruthlessly 7000 greeks died andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the sicilian army from reaching constantinople but his forces failed to stand and retreated to the outlying hills andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the norman fleet from entering the  the invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor 
andronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy and his plans were nearly successful but on september 11 1185 during his absence from the capital stephen hagiochristophorites his lieutenant moved to arrest  whose loyalty was suspect  isaac killed hagiochristophorites and took uge in the church of  he appealed to the populace and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city
when andronikos arrived he found that isaac had been proclaimed emperor the deposed emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife agnes and his mistress but they were captured though some claim that andronikos survived and managed to escape to the then self proclaimed kingdom of  isaac handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten his right hand was cut off his teeth and hair were pulled out one of his eyes was gouged out and among many other sufferings boiling water was thrown in his face punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness at last he was led to the  and hung by his feet between two pillars two latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply and he was according to the representation of his death torn apartniketas choniates p 193  he died on september 12 1185 at the news of the emperors death his son and co emperor john was murdered by his own troops in

apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the   and the third intended to  the craft was launched on april 11 1970 at 1313  from the  but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later crippling the  sm upon which the  cm depended despite great hardship caused by limited power loss of cabin heat shortage of potable water and the critical need to  the carbon dioxide removal system the crew returned safely to  on april 17
the flight passed over the far side of the moon at an altitude of  from the lunar surface  400171 km 248655 mi from earth a  marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from earth  the mission was commanded by  with  as command module pilot and  as lunar module pilot swigert was a late replacement for the original cm pilot  who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to 
by the standard crew rotation in place during the apollo program the prime crew for apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for  with mercury and gemini veteran  in command that crew was composed of
 commander
 command module pilot
 lunar module pilot
 nasas director of flight crew operations never intended to rotate cooper and eisele to another mission as both were out of favor with nasa management for various reasons cooper for his lax attitude towards training and eisele for incidents aboard  and an extra marital  he assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight qualified manpower in the astronaut office at the time the assignment needed to be made name slayton  slayton felt cooper had a very small chance of receiving the apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment which he did not despite eiseles issues with management slayton always intended to assign him to a future  mission rather than a lunar mission but this program was eventually cut down to only the  component
thus the original assignment slayton submitted to his superiors for this flight was
 commander
 command module pilot
 lunar module pilot
for the first time ever slaytons recommendation was rejected by management who felt that shepard needed more time to train properly for a lunar flight as he had only recently benefited from experimental surgery to correct an  which had kept him grounded since  in 1961 thus lovells crew backup for the historic  mission and theore slated for  was swapped with shepards crew name slayton   and the original crew selection for the mission became
prime crew
backup crew
ken mattingly was originally intended as the command module pilot seven days before launch the backup lunar module pilot charlie duke contracted  from one of his children this exposed both the prime and backup crews who trained together  mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had rubella as a child and thus was not immune three days before launch at the insistence of the flight surgeon swigert was moved to the prime crew 
mattingly never contracted rubella and was assigned after the flight as command module pilot to youngs crew which later flew  the fifth mission to land on the moon

the crew performed the separation and transposition maneuver to dock the command module odyssey to the  lm aquarius and pulled away from the spent third stage which ground controllers then sent on a course to impact the moon in range of a seismometer placed on surface by  they then settled in for the three day trip to fra mauro
approaching 56 hours into the mission apollo 13 was approximately  from earth en route to the moon name gatland   approximately six and a half minutes after the end of a live tv broadcast from the spacecraft haise was in the process of powering down the lm while lovell was stowing the tv camera and  flight controllers asked swigert to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans in the service module which were designed to destratify the  contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings almost two minutes later the astronauts heard a loud bang accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and firing of the attitude control thrusters name timeline   the crew initially thought that a  might have struck the lunar module communications and telemetry to earth were lost for 18 seconds until the system automatically corrected by switching the high gain  antenna used for translunar communications from narrow beam to wide beam mode name autopage 4 44 paragraph 2  http  ntrsnasagov archive nasa casintrsnasagov 19700076776pdf 
immediately after the bang lovell reported a main b bus undervolt a temporary loss of operating voltage on the second of the spacecrafts main electrical circuits oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero about three minutes later the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting a gas of some sort into space the number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes entirely depleting the sms oxygen supply name report  
because the fuel cells generated the command service modules electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water when oxygen tank 1 ran dry the remaining fuel cell finally shut down leaving the craft on the command modules limited duration battery power and water the crew was forced to shut down the cm completely to save this for re entry and to power up the lm to use as a lifeboat  this situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation but had not been considered a likely scenario  without the lm the accident would certainly have been fatal 
the damage to the service module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible so lead flight director  ordered an abort of the mission the existing abort plans first drawn up in 1966 were evaluated the quickest was a direct abort trajectory which required using the service module propulsion system sps engine to achieve a   name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 14 sup although a successful sps firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time get would land the crew one day earlier at 118 hours get or 58 hours later the large delta v was possible only if the lm were jettisoned first name   missionopreport suppampnbspii 1 sup and since crew survival depended on the lms presence during the coast back to earth that option was out of the question name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 17 sup an alternative would have been to burn the sps fuel to depletion then jettison the service module and make a second burn with the lm  dps engine it was desired to keep the service module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the command modules heat shield apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar  at 61 hours get which was the break even point between direct and circumlunar aborts and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn name   missionopreport supp b 5 sup there also was concern about the structural integrity of the service module name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii‑23 sup so mission planners were instructed that the sps engine would not be used except as a last ditch effort name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 14 sup
for these reasons kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option using the moons gravity to return the ship to earth apollo 13 had left its initial  earlier in the mission as required for the lunar landing at fra mauro theore the first order of business was to re establish the free return trajectory with a 307 second burn of the dps the descent engine was used again two hours after  the closest approach to the moon pc+2 burn to speed the return to earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the indian ocean to the pacific ocean a more aggressive burn could have been performed at pc+2 by first jettisoning the service module returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 20 sup but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used the 4 minute 24 second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed
considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew s and support personnel for the safe return the developing drama was shown on television  because electrical power was severely limited no more live tv broadcasts were made tv commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations low power levels made even voice communications difficult
the lunar module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half not three people for four days oxygen was the least critical consumable because the lm carried enough to repressurize the lm after each surface  unlike the  csm which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct the lm was powered by  so electrical power and water used for equipment cooling as well as drinking were critical consumables to keep the lm life support and communication systems operational until re entry the lm was powered down to the lowest levels possible in particular the lms  was used for most of the coast back to earth instead of the primary guidance system as it used less power and water name   missionopreport supppampnbspiii‑173340 sup
availability of  lioh for  presented a serious problem the lms internal stock of lioh canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return and the remainder was stored in the descent stage out of reach the cm had an adequate supply of canisters but these were incompatible with the lm engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube shaped cm canisters to the lms cylindrical canister sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose the astronauts called the jury rigged device the mailbox 
another problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power up from scratch of the completely shut down command module something never intended to be done in flight flight controller  with the support of grounded astronaut mattingly and many engineers and designers had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ships limited power supply and time factor  this was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the lm caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as  the unpowered cm got so cold that water began to  on solid surfaces causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated this turned out not to be a problem partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the  fire 
the last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before re entry the normal procedure was to use the service modules  rcs to pull the csm away after releasing the lm along with the command modules docking ring but this rcs was inoperative because of the power failure and the useless sm would be released before the lm to solve the problem grumman called on the engineering expertise of the university of toronto a team of six ut engineers was formed led by senior scientist  to solve the problem in one day the team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the lunar module to the command module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re entry the team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required using s they needed an accurate calculation as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal causing the astronauts to burn up too low a pressure would fail to provide sufficient separation of the lm grumman relayed their calculation to nasa and from there in turn to the astronauts who used it successfully name gampm 
as apollo 13 neared earth the crew first jettisoned the service module using the lms  to pull themselves a safe distance from it instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the sms rcs they photographed it for later analysis of the accidents cause it was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the entire sector 4 panel had been blown off according to the analysts these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment
finally the crew jettisoned the lunar module aquarius using the above procedure worked out at the university of toronto leaving the command module odyssey to begin its lone re entry through the atmosphere the re entry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the command module the blackout in apollo 13s reentry lasted six minutes which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected  the possibility of heat shield damage from the  tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period
odyssey regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the south pacific ocean  southwest of  and  from the recovery ship 
the crew was in good condition except for haise who was suffering from a serious  because of insufficient water intake to avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft the crew had been instructed to temporarily stop urine dumps a misunderstanding prompted the crew to store all urine for the rest of the flight 
nasa administrator  and deputy administrator  sent a memorandum to nasa  director  on april 17 1970 date of spacecraft splashdown advising him of his appointment as chairman of an apollo 13 review board to investigate the cause of the accident
a second memorandum to cortright from paine and low on april 21 established the board as follows

the board exhaustively investigated and analyzed the history of the manufacture and testing of the oxygen tank and its installation and testing in the spacecraft up to the apollo 13 launch as documented in detailed records and logs they visited and consulted with engineers at the contractors sites and the kennedy space center once a theory of the cause was developed elements of it were tested including on a test rig simulation in a vacuum chamber with a damaged tank installed in the fuel cell bay this test confirmed the theory when a similar explosion was created which blew off the outer panel exactly as happened in the flight
cortright sent the final report of apollo 13 review board to thomas paine on june 15 1970

the resulting pressure inside the compartment popped the bolts attaching the  sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel which as it blew off probably caused minor damage to the nearby s band antenna name auto 
 forced the oxygen valves closed on the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells leaving them operating for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines the shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank or caused its check or relief valve to leak causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes entirely depleting the sms oxygen supply name report  
the board determined the oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events tanks storing s such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen require either venting extremely good insulation or both in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks contents the service module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain  hydrogen and oxygen for years each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water the construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible
the tank contained several components relevant to the accident
 a quantity sensor
 a fan to stir the tank contents for more accurate quantity measurements
 a  to vaporize liquid oxygen as needed
 a  to protect the heater
 a 
 fill and drain valves and piping
the heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the command modules 28 volt dc bus the specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65 volt ground supply in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly  the tank subcontractor did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage
the oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the apollo 10 service module but was removed to fix a potential  problem during removal the shelf was accidentally dropped about  because a retaining bolt had not been removed the tank appeared to be undamaged but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged and photographs suggested that the close out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf the report of the apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be rather low name report  
after the tank was filled for ground testing it could not be emptied through the normal drain line to avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank the heater was connected to 65 volt ground power to boil off the oxygen lovell signed off on this procedure it should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of  when the thermostat opened the 65 volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered the board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage
this raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated  a  on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly but no one noticed it at the time because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the  thermostat opening temperature the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank  name lostmoon  the gas evaporated in hours rather than days
the sustained high temperatures melted the  insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed when the tank was illed with oxygen it became a bomb waiting to go off during the cryo stir procedure fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted producing sparks and igniting the teflon this in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it
in june 1970 the cortright report name report   provided an in depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five chapter report with eight appendices it included a copy of established nasa procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank to include
turning the four tank heaters and fans off
pulling the two heater circuit breakers to open to remove the energy source
performing a 2 minute purge or directly opening the osub2 sub valve
this procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued the mission operations report apollo 13 recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low pressure reading on hydrogen tank 2 and so it did not trigger to call attention to the high oxygen pressure reading 
oxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission prior to the accident the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the lunar module forward by three hours this was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium she tank in the lm descent stage which had been suspect since before launch after the abort decision the helium pressure continued to rise and mission control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture the helium tank  ruptured at 10854 after the lunar flyby the expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control ptc roll nicknamed the barbecue roll 
while the investigation board did recreate the oxygen tank failure it did not report on any experiments that would show how effective the cryogenic malfunctions procedures were to prevent the system failure by de energizing the electrical heater and fan circuits
the oxygen tank was redesigned with the thermostats upgraded to handle the proper voltage the heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure the stirring fans with their unsealed motors were removed which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate this required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full name gatland2 
all electrical wiring in the power system bay was sheathed in stainless steel and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel the fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the teflon coated wiring from the oxygen the spacecraft and mission control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies name gatland2 
because apollo 13 followed the  its altitude over the  was approximately  greater than the orbital altitude on the remaining apollo lunar missions due to this fact apollo 13 holds the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft reaching a distance of  from earth on 721ampnbsppm est april 14 1970 
the  spacesuit intended to be worn on the lunar surface by lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms legs lunar eva helmet assembly and the life support backpack this came about because mission control personnel watching the video feeds of apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down the red bands were used for the remaining apollo flights the  and in the 
the apollo 13 mission was called a successful failure by lovell
  because of the successful safe return of the astronauts but the failed lunar landing lead   and
  the first one to see the telemetry of the initial oxygen tank failure both describe it decades later as nasas finest hour  
president nixon awarded the  to the crew and the  for their actions during the mission
the cold cathode gauge experiment ccge which was part of the  on apollo 13 was never flown again it was a version of the cold cathode ion gauge ccig which featured on apollo 12 apollo 14 and  the ccge was designed as a standalone version of the ccig on other missions the ccig was connected as part of the suprathermal ion detector side because of the aborted landing this experiment was never deployed other experiments included on apollo 13s alsep included the heat flow experiment hfe the passive seismic experiment pse and the charged particle lunar environment experiment cplee 
the original  affixed to the front landing leg of aquarius bore mattingly’s name so a replacement plaque with swigert’s name was carried in the cabin for lovell to place over the other after he descended the ladder he kept the plaque as a souvenir in his book  later renamed apollo 13 lovell stated that apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces the only other memento he possesses is a letter from 
the apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as apollos chariot across space given lovells navy background the logo also included the mottoes ex luna scientia from the moon knowledge borrowed from the s motto ex scientia tridens from knowledge sea power the mission number appeared in  as apollo xiii the patch did not have to be modified after mattinglys replacement since it is one of only two apollo mission insignia—the other being apollo 11—not to include the names of the crew it was designed by artist  who based it on a mural he had done for  in new york city   the mural was later purchased by actor  who portrayed lovell in the movie  and now is on the wall of a restaurant near chicago owned by lovells son 
despite apollo 13s failure to land on the moon several experiments were conducted successfully because they were initiated before or conducted independently of the oxygen tank explosion 
several experiments to study electrical phenomena were conducted prior to and during the launch of apollo 13 this information was used to better understand hazards of launching in less than ideal weather conditions
 eleven photographs of earth were taken at precisely recorded times to study the feasibility of using geosynchronous satellites to study cloud height
 apollo 13s  third stage was the first to be purposely crashed into the lunar surface as an active seismic experiment which measured its impact with a seismometer left on the lunar surface by the crew of apollo 12 the s ivbs from the previous four lunar missions were sent into solar orbit by ground control after use
as a joke following apollo 13s successful splashdown  pilot sam greenberg who had helped with the strategy for re routing power from the lm to the crippled cm issued a tongue in cheek invoice for 40054005 to   and    prime and subcontractors for the csm for towing the crippled ship most of the way to the moon and back the figure was based on an estimated  at 100 per mile plus 400 for the first mile an extra 53605 was included for battery charging oxygen and an additional guest in room swigert a 20% commercial discount as well as a further 2% discount if north american were to pay in cash reduced the total to 31242124 one version of the invoice includes an extra 100000 charge for keeping this invoice confidential  north american declined payment noting that it had ferried three previous grumman lms to the moon apollo 10 apollo 11 and apollo 12 with no such reciprocal charges

the 1974 movie  while set around the apollo 13 incident is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives only a couple of news clips and a narrators solemn voice deal with the actual problems houston weve got a problem was also the title of an episode of the  documentary series a life at stake broadcast in march 1978 this was an accurate if simplified reconstruction of the events 
lovell was approached in 1991 by journalist  about collaborating on a non fiction account of the mission the resultant book  was published in 1994 the next year a film adaptation of the book  was released directed by  and starring  as lovell  as haise  as swigert  as mattingly  as   and  as marilyn lovell james lovell kranz and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy given that some  was taken for example the film changes the tense of lovells famous statement houston weve had a problem to houston we have a problem name air2ground   the film was nominated for several academy awards including best picture best supporting actor harris and best supporting actress quinlan
in the 1998 miniseries  co produced by hanks and howard the mission is dramatized in the episode we interrupt this program rather than showing the incident from the crews perspective as in the apollo 13 feature film it is instead presented from an earth bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event
in 2008 an interactive theatrical show titled   premiered at  in wellington new zealand theatreview media release and subsequent reviews of the  production of apollo 13 mission control  the production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline the show also featured a guest astronaut each night a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line houston weve had a problem this replacement astronaut was a nod to jack swigert who replaced ken mattingly shortly before the launch in 1970 the production toured to other cities extensively in new zealand and australia in 2010–2011 the production was scheduled to travel to the usa in 2012
in november 2011 a notebook containing a checklist lovell used to calculate a trajectory to get the damaged spacecraft apollo 13 back to earth and handwritten calculations by lovell was auctioned off by  for 388375 nasa made an email inquiry asking heritage if lovell had clear title to the notebook stating that nasa had nothing to indicate the agency had ever transferred ownership of the checklist to lovell in january 2012 heritage stated that the sale had been placed on hold after nasa launched an investigation into whether it was the astronaut’s property to sell

apollo 7 was a 1968  mission carried out by the  it was the first mission in the united states  to carry a crew into space it was also the first us spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of  in november 1966 the  also known as apollo 1 was intended to be the first manned flight of the apollo program scheduled to launch in february 1967 however a fire in the cabin during a january 1967 test killed the crew manned flights were then suspended for 21 months while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements were made to the spacecraft and safety procedures apollo 7 essentially fulfilled apollo 1s mission 
the apollo 7 crew was commanded by  with command module pilot  and lunar module pilot  their mission was  an 11 day earth orbital test flight to check out the redesigned block ii  csm with a crew on board it was the first launch of a  vehicle to put a crew into space the first three person american space mission and the first live tv broadcast from an american spacecraft it was successfully launched on october 11 1968 from what was then known as  florida despite tension between the crew and ground controllers the mission was a complete technical success giving  the confidence to launch  around the  two months later however the flight would prove to be the final space flight for all of its three crew members when it splashed down in the atlantic ocean on october 22 1968 it was also the final  launch from 
schirra eisele and cunningham were first named as an apollo crew on september 29 1966 they were to fly a second earth orbital test of the original block i command service module not designed to dock with the  for lunar flight after  the first manned flight to be made by   and  in december 1966 the second mission was deemed redundant and canceled and schirras crew were reassigned as grissoms backup
plans for the first manned apollo flights were completely disrupted by the january 27 1967 cabin fire which killed grissom white and chaffee schirra eisele and cunningham were later named as prime crew for the first manned flight which would now use the block ii spacecraft designed for the lunar missions the  cm and astronauts spacesuits had been extensively redesigned to reduce and eliminate the chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew schirra thus became the only astronaut to fly   and apollo missions name schirras obituary  his crew would test the life support propulsion guidance and control systems during this open ended mission meaning it would be extended as it passed each test the duration was limited to 11 days reduced from the original 14 day limit for apollo 1  since it flew in  and did not include the  lm apollo 7 was launched with the saturn ib booster rather than the much larger and more powerful  name saturn ib history 
throughout the mercury and gemini programs  engineer  had been leader of the spacecraft launch pad teams with ultimate responsibility for condition of the spacecraft at launch he earned the astronauts respect and admiration including schirras name guenter wendt obit  however the spacecraft contractor had changed from mcdonnell mercury amp gemini to  apollo so wendt was not the pad leader for apollo 1 name firstonthemoon pp 51–54 
so adamant was schirra in his desire to have wendt back as pad leader for his apollo flight that he got his boss  to persuade north american management to hire wendt away from mcdonnell and schirra personally lobbied north americans launch operations manager to change wendts shift from midnight to day so he could be pad leader for apollo 7 wendt remained as pad leader for the entire apollo program name firstonthemoon  
wendts face was the last they saw before the hatch was sealed and immediately after liftoff eisele said with a mock german accent into his radio i vonder vere guenter vendt name firstonthemoon  
the first manned american space flight in 22 months lifted from lc 34 at 1005 am local time on friday october 22 1968 liftoff proceeded flawlessly the saturn ib performed well on its first manned launch and there were no significant anomalies during the boost phase the astronauts described it as very smooth riding compared to the rough bumpy titan ii used to launch the  spacecraft
following orbital injection and separation from the  the crew turned the csm around using its  thrusters and eisele practiced a simulated lunar module rendezvous and docking using a visual erence target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the lm one of the adapter panels on the s ivb failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position reminding   of his angry alligator experience on  when docking was prevented by mis deployed adapter panels had this been an actual lunar mission the astronauts might have found the process of lm extraction from the adapter more difficult risking possible damage this reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent apollo saturn v flights name astronautixcom 
the apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems and the  sps the all important engine that would place apollo into and out of lunar orbit made eight firings performing within 1% of the engine acceptance test thrust and  values as the saturn ib itself had performed very smoothly during launch the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the sps leading to schirra yelling yabbadabbadoo in erence to  cartoon don eisele called it a real boot in the rear 
an assortment of minor hardware problems occurred over the flight these included the drinking water hose trigger sticking during the final two days a momentary undervolt of the main ac buses caused by the automatic cryo fan switch in the service module lox and lh2 tanks and a loss of telemetry due to a malfunctioning electrical commutator following sm jettison at the end of the mission meaning that the final 15 minutes of data transmission were lost aside from the last event which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator all of the problems on apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions
apollo promised the best food preparation yet seen on a manned spacecraft for the first time astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with the food came in freeze dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water and wally schirra who had  had only toothpaste like tubes for food on his  described the food as still does not match home cooking but it comes a lot closer than space food used to thirty three meals were provided for the three crewmen allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space even so the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet although the menus had been prepared based on their personal perences apollo 7 was also the only time so called astronaut ice cream which went on to become a staple of hobby shops was carried on an actual flight
early fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the cm would make it hard for the spacecrafts attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded and they reported that motion was incredibly easy with no gravity to work against as sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful an exercise device called the exer genie was provided name astronautixcom  
another mission goal was the first   from an american spacecraft  had transmitted  pictures from  in 1963 which were never broadcast name apollo video camera pp 55–58  it was initially scheduled for midday on day two but schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the  test name schirra cancels tv 
even though apollos larger cabin was more comfortable than geminis 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts tension with schirra began with the launch decision when flight managers decided to launch with a less than ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent once in orbit the spacious cabin may have induced some crew  which had not been an issue in the earlier smaller spacecraft the crew were unhappy with their food selections especially the high energy sweets they also found the waste collection system cumbersome requiring 30 minutes to use and smelly but the worst problem occurred when schirra developed a severe  as a result he became irritable with requests from  and all three astronauts began talking back to the capcom an early example was this exchange after mission control requested that a tv camera be turned on in the spacecraft

schirra we do not have the equipment out we have not had an opportunity to follow setting we have not eaten at this point at this point i have a cold i use to foul up our time lines this way 
 blockquote
a further source of tension between mission control and the crew was that schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off contrary to previous project mercury and gemini experience they perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds and they wanted to be able to pinch their noses and blow to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry this would have been impossible wearing the helmets as the new apollo helmets were a continuous fishbowl type without a moveable visor unlike previous helmets however on repeated occasions over the course of the mission schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons in the final exchange on the subject mission control made it clear to schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions

in april 1966 mcdivitt scott and schweickart were selected by deke slayton as the second apollo crew as backup to   and  for the first manned earth orbital test flight of the   designated  expected to fly in late 1966 this was to be followed by a second block i flight as 205 to be crewed by   and
 the third manned mission designated as 207 208 was planned to fly the block ii command module and the  in earth orbit launched on separate s with a crew to be named
however delays in the block i csm development pushed as 204 into 1967 by december 1966 the original as 205 mission was cancelled schirras crew was named as grissoms backup and mcdivitts crew was promoted to prime crew for the lm test mission  re designated as 205 208 on january 26 1967 they were training for this flight expected to occur in late 1967 in the first block ii command module 101 at the  plant in 
 
the next day grissoms crew were conducting a launch pad test for their planned february 21 mission which they named  when a fire broke out in the cabin killing all three men and putting an 18 month hold on the manned program while the block ii  cm and  were redesigned for safety
as it turned out a 1967 launch of as 205 208 would have been impossible even absent the apollo 1 accident as problems with the lm delayed its first unmanned test flight until january 1968 nasa was able to use the 18 month hiatus to catch up with development and unmanned testing of the lm and the saturn v launch vehicle 
by october 1967 planning for manned flights resumed with  being the first earth orbit csm flight now known as the c mission in october 1968 given to schirras crew and mcdivitts mission now known as the d mission following as apollo 8 in december 1968 using a single saturn v instead of the two saturn ibs this would be followed by a higher earth orbit flight e mission to be crewed by   and  in early 1969
however lm problems again prevented it from being ready for the d mission by december so nasa officials created another mission for  using the saturn v to launch only the csm on the first manned flight to orbit the moon and the e mission was cancelled as unnecessary slayton asked mcdivitt and borman which mission they perred to fly mcdivitt wanted to fly the lm while borman volunteered for the pioneering lunar flight theore slayton swapped the crews and mcdivitts crew flew apollo 9
the crew swap also affected who would be the first crew to land on the moon when the crews for apollo 8 and 9 were swapped their backup crews were also swapped since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later this put s crew bormans backup in position for the first landing mission  instead of s crew who made the second landing on 
apollo 9 was the first space test of the complete apollo spacecraft including the third critical piece of apollo hardware besides the command service module and the saturn v launch vehicle—the lunar module it was also the first  of two vehicles with an internal crew transfer between them for ten days the astronauts put both apollo spacecraft through their paces in earth orbit including an undocking and redocking of the lunar lander with the command vehicle just as the landing mission crew would perform in lunar orbit apollo 9 gave proof that the apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend
for this and all subsequent apollo flights the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft the last spacecraft to have been named was  the gangly lm was named spider and the csm was labeled gumdrop because of the command modules shape and also the blue wrapping in which the craft arrived at  these names were required as radio call signs when the vehicles flew independently
schweickart and scott performed an eva—schweickart checked out the new  the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft while scott filmed him from the command module hatch schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activities to test the suit and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an eva from the lunar module to the command module in an emergency but as he had been suffering from  the extra tests were scratched
mcdivitt and schweickart later test flew the lm and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in earth orbit they flew the lm up to  from gumdrop using the engine on the descent stage to propel them originally before jettisoning it and using the ascent stage to return this test flight represented the first flight of a manned spacecraft that was not equipped to reenter the earths atmosphere
the splashdown point was 23 deg 15 min n 67 deg 56 min w 180ampnbspmiles 290ampnbspkm east of  and within sight of the recovery ship  apollo 9 was the last spacecraft to splash down in the atlantic ocean
the command module was displayed at the michigan space and science center  until april 2004 when the center closed in may 2004 it was moved to the  now named the san diego air amp space museum the lm ascent stage orbit decayed on october 23 1981 the lm descent stage 1969 018d orbit decayed march 22 1969 the  stage  engine was restarted after lunar module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion

the circular patch shows a drawing of a saturn v rocket with the letters usa on it to its right an apollo csm is shown next to an lm with the csms nose pointed at the front door of the lm rather than at its top docking port the csm is trailing rocket fire in a circle the crews names are along the top edge of the circle with apollo  at the bottom the d in mcdivitts name is filled with red to mark that this was the d mission in the alphabetic sequence of apollo missions the patch was designed by allen stevens of  a version of this article was published concurrently in the s  magazine

there are over 100 different forms of arthritishttp  wwwhealthlinecom adamcontent arthritis healthline http  wwwwebmdcom osteoarthritis guide arthritis basics web md  the most common form of arthritis is  degenerative joint disease a result of trauma to the joint infection of the joint or age other arthritis forms are   and related   is caused by joint 
the major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is  pain is often constant and may be localized to the joint affected
the pain from arthritis is due to  that occurs around the joint damage to the joint from disease daily wear and tear of joint muscle  caused by forceful movements against stiff painful joints and 
there are several diseases where joint pain is primary and is considered the main feature generally when a person has arthritis it means that they have one of these diseases which include

pain which can vary in severity is a common symptom in virtually all types of arthritis other symptoms include   and aching around the joints arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body leading to a variety of symptomshttp  wwwcdcgov chronicdisease resources publications aag arthritishtm arthritis the nation’s most common cause of disability centers for disease prevention and health promotion retrieved on 2010 01 24  symptoms may include
 inability to use the  or 
 stiffness which may be worse in the morning or after use
  and fatigue
 
 poor 
  and pains
 
 difficulty moving the joint
it is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur for example arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and or exercise which can lead to secondary effects such as

arthritis is the most common cause of  in the usa more than 20 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basishttp  wwwcdcgov chronicdisease resources publications aag arthritishtm arthritis the nations most common cause of disability the center for disease control retrieved on 2015 01 04   and frequent visits to the  are common in individuals who have arthritis arthritis can make it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and some become home bound
it is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to 100 billion of which almost 50% is from lost earnings each year arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to  centers 
decreased mobility in combination with the above symptoms can make it difficult for an individual to remain physically active contributing to an increased risk of obesity high  or vulnerability to   people with arthritis are also at increased risk of  which may be a response to numerous factors including fear of worsening symptoms 
diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests depending on the type of suspected arthritis  all arthritides potentially feature  pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location  is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness in the early stages patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower  on the other hand tends to be worse after exercise in the aged and children pain might not be the main presenting feature the aged patient simply moves less the infantile patient uses to use the affected limb
elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis important features are speed and time of onset pattern of joint involvement symmetry of symptoms early morning stiffness tenderness gelling or locking with inactivity aggravating and relieving factors and other systemic symptoms physical examination may confirm the diagnosis or may indicate systemic disease radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity
s and s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected these might include   anf  and specific antibodies
 is the most common form of arthritis name van2010  it can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body including the hands  feet back hip and knee the disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint however osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury in recent years some joint or limb deformities such as knock knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia have also been considered as a predisposing factor for knee or hip osteoarthritis osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other the condition starts with minor pain during physical activity but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest the pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities osteoarthritis typically affects the weight bearing joints such as the back spine and pelvis unlike rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly more than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65 risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma obesity and a sedentary lifestyle
rheumatoid arthritis ra is a disorder in which the bodys own immune system starts to attack body  the attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body in rheumatoid arthritis most damage occurs to the joint lining and  which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones ra often affects joints in the fingers wrists knees and elbows is symmetrical appears on both sides of the body and can lead to severe  in a few years if not treated ra occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above in children the disorder can present with a skin    disability and limitations in daily activities with earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment many individuals can lead a better quality of life than if going undiagnosed for long after ras onset the drugs to treat ra range from s to  given  treatments also include analgesics such as s and s dmards while in rare cases surgery may be required to replace joints but there is no cure for the diseasehttp  wwwaihwgovau rheumatoid arthritis management  medications used to manage rheumatoid arthritis australian institute of health and welfare retrieved 2015 11 14 
treatment with dmards is designed to initiate an  in part by cd4+ t helper th cells specifically th17 cells name pmid23383714  th17 cells are present in higher quantities at the site of bone destruction in joints and produce inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammation such as interleukin 17 il 17 name chabaud_2000 
bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing s and bone forming s one of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the  caused in part by the production of pro inflammatory  and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand rankl a cell surface protein present in th17 cells and osteoblasts name chabaud_2000  osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the rank rankl mechanism name pmid21464945 
 is a common   disorder that can be present with severe arthritis other features of lupus include a skin rash extreme    problems lung fibrosis and constant joint pain 
 is caused by deposition of  crystals in the joint causing inflammation there is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as  in the early stages the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint but with time it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling the joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout cannot successfully be treated name becker  when uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid eg allopurinol febuxostat or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys eg probenecid this can be erred to as ractory chronic gout or rcg name ali

there is no known cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include  lifestyle changes including exercise and weight control  and medications  may be required in eroding forms of arthritis medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain moreover by decreasing inflammation the joint damage may be slowed
in general studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can have noticeable improvement in terms of long term pain relief furthermore exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person 
individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and  in arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function decrease pain and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases  exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength endurance and flexibility in some cases exercises may be designed to train balance occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities as well as equipment
there are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective 
depending on the type of arthritis the medications that are given may be different for example the first line treatment for  is  paracetamol while for  it involves  nsaids like  s and nsaids are less well tolerated

compared to most s acetylene is relatively acidic though it is still much less acidic than water or  thus it reacts with strong bases to form  salts for example acetylene reacts with  in liquid  to form sodium acetylide and with  in cold  to give lithium acetylide name midland1990

acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe often associated with the atmospheres of s  one curious discovery of acetylene is on  a moon of  natural acetylene is believed to form from  decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of 1770ampnbspk and above since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry  
acetylene is not especially toxic but when generated from  it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of  and  which give it a distinct garlic like smell it is also highly flammable as most light hydrocarbons hence its use in welding its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability especially when it is pressurized under certain conditions acetylene can react in an  addition type reaction to form a number of products typically  and or  possibly in addition to  and  consequently acetylene if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about 200ampnbspkpa 29ampnbsppsi most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report  and the safe limit for acetylene theore is 101 kpasubgage sub or 15 psig   it is theore supplied and stored dissolved in  or  dmf name industrial gases  contained in a  with a porous filling  which renders it safe to transport and use given proper handling

athenian democracy developed around the fifth century bc in the greek  known as a  of  comprising the city of athens and the surrounding territory of  and is the first known  in the world other greek cities set up democracies most following the athenian model but none are as well documented as athens
it was a system of  in which participating citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills participation was not open to all residents to vote one had to be an adult male citizen who owned land and wasnt a slave and the number of these varied between 30000 and 50000 out of a total population of around 250000 to 300000thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005 https  booksgooglecom booksid iu6eagaaqbajamppg pa74 p 74

the word democracy greek δημοκρατία combines the elements dêmos δῆμος which means people and krátos κράτος which means force or power in the words monarchy and oligarchy the second element arche ἀρχή means rule leading or being first it is unlikely that the term democracy was coined by its detractors who rejected the possibility of a valid demarchy as the word demarchy already existed and had the meaning of  or  one could assume the new term was coined and adopted by athenian democrats
the word is attested in  who wrote some of the first surviving greek prose but this might not have been before 440 or 430 bc we are not certain that the word democracy was extant when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted but around 460 bcraaflaub kurt a 2007 the breakthrough of demokratia in mid fifth century athens p 112 in   an individual is known with the name of democrates a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty the name can also be found in   anabasis 4415 
athens was not the only  in ancient greece that instituted a democratic regime aristotle cites many other cities as well yet it is only with erence to athens that we can attempt to trace some of specific sixth century events that led to the institution of democracy at the end of the centuryhttps  booksgooglecom booksid qry16udq83ecamppg pa194ampdq athen+democra+originamphl enampsa xampei qxrbu5udlddy7aauzygibqampved 0cc4q6aewag#v onepageampq athen%20democra%20originampf false clarke pb and foweraker encyclopedia of democratic thoughtroutledge 2003 p 196 
before the first attempt at democratic government athens was ruled by a series of s or chief magistrates and the  made up of ex archons the members of these institutions were generally aristocrats who ruled the polis for their own advantage in 621 bc  codified a set of notoriously harsh laws that were a clear expression of the power of the aristocracy over everybody else this did not stop the aristocratic families feuding amongst themselves to obtain as much power as possible name thorley 2005 10thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005 p10

solon the mediator reshaped the city by absorbing the traditional aristocracy in a definition of citizenship which allotted a political function to every free resident of attica athenians were not slaves but citizens with the right at the very least to participate in the meetings of the assembly under these orms the position of archon was opened to all with certain property qualifications and a  a rival council of 400 was set up the areopagus nevertheless retained guardianship of the lawsencyclopaedia britannica areopagus  a major contribution to democracy was solons setting up of an  or assembly which was open to all male citizens however one must bear in mind that its agenda was apparently set entirely by the council of 400 consisting of 100 members from each of the four tribes that had taken over many of the powers which the areopagos had previously exercised name thorley 2005 10 
not long afterwards the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant  but was reinstated after the expulsion of the son of peisistratos in 510 this sort of aristocratic takeover was ended by the appeal by one contender  for the support of the populace the orms of cleisthenes in 508 7 undermined the domination of the aristocratic families and connected every athenian to the citys rule cleisthenes fixed the boundaries of the polis as a political rather than a geographical entity – boundaries which solon had left permeable – by formally identifying the free inhabitants of attica at that time as athenian citizenshttps  booksgooglecom booksid bp04aaaaiaajampdq origins+democraticampq %22ensuing+conflict+was%22#v snippetampq %22ensuing%20conflict%20was%22ampf false farrar c the origins of democratic thinking the invention of politics in classical athens cup archive 25 aug 1989 p21  he did this by making the traditional tribes politically irrelevant and instituting ten new tribes each made up of about three trytties each consisting of several s every male citizen on reaching the age of 18 was now to be registered in his deme it was this registration which confirmed his citizenshiphttps  booksgooglecom booksid iu6eagaaqbajampprintsec frontcoverampdq athenian+democracy+thorleyamphl enampsa xampei ibluu9w4j6yw7ab_ ohadwampved 0cceq6aewaa#v snippetampq between%2030%2c000ampf false thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005  p25 
a third set of orms was instigated by  in 462 1 while his opponents were away attempting to assist the spartans ephialtes persuaded the assembly to reduce the powers of the areopagus in effect stripping it of all its controlling and supervisory powers and leaving it only as a court for cases of homicide and certain offences of sacrilege at the same time or soon afterwards the membership of the areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship name thorley 2005 55 56thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005  ppampnbsp55–56 
estimates of the population of ancient athens vary during the 4th century bc there might well have been some 250000–300000 people in attica citizen families could have amounted to 100000 people and out of these some 30000 would have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly in the mid 5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60000 but this number fell precipitously during the peloponnesian war name homepagesgaceduhttp  homepagesgacedu ~arosenth 265 athenian_democracypdf rothchild ja introduction to athenian democracy of the fifth and fourth centuries bce  this slump was permanent due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below from a modern perspective these figures may seem small but among greek city states athens was huge most of the thousand or so greek cities could only muster 1000–1500 adult male citizens each and corinth a major power had at most 15000https  booksgooglecom booksid hn7pawaaqbajamppg pa44ampdq corinth+populationamphl enampsa xampei hpvxu62wi4teop ogfgoampved 0ceyq6aewbw#v onepageampq corinth%20populationampf false dixon md late classical and early hellenistic corinth 338–196 bc routledge 2014 p 44

citizenship commonly applied not only to the individuals themselves but to their descendants as well could be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups eg ns in 427 bc and  in 405 bc but by the 4th century only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000 this was generally done as a reward for some service to the state in the course of a century the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than thousandshttps  booksgooglecom booksid rxh3ucc2fywcampdq athens+citizenship+grantampq %22citizenship+was+not%22#v snippetampq %22citizenship%20was%20not%22ampf false sinclair rkdemocracy and participation in athens cambridge university press 30 aug 1991 ppampnbsp25–26 
there were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands these are the assembly in some cases with a quorum of 6000 the council of 500  and the courts a minimum of 200 people but running at least on some occasions up to 6000 of these three bodies it is the assembly and the courts that were the true sites of power – although courts unlike the assembly were never simply called the demos the people as they were manned by a subset of the citizen body those over thirty but crucially citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution as were council members and all other officeholders
in the 5th century bc we often hear of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials by the mid 4th century however the assemblys judicial functions were largely curtailed though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial

the assembly had four main functions it made executive pronouncements decrees such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner it elected some officials it legislated and it tried political crimes as the system evolved the last function was shifted to the law courts the standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position followed by a general vote usually by show of hands of yes or no
though there might be blocs of opinion sometimes enduring on important matters there were no political parties and likewise no  or  as in the  voting was by simple  in the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly if the assembly broke the law the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to if a mistake had been made from the assemblys viewpoint it could only be because it had been misledhttps  booksgooglecom booksid iu6eagaaqbajampprintsec frontcoverampdq athenian+democracy+thorleyamphl enampsa xampei ibluu9w4j6yw7ab_ ohadwampved 0cceq6aewaa#v snippetampq between%2030%2c000ampf false thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005  p57

in the 5th century bc there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year one in each of the ten  with other meetings called as needed in the following century the meetings were set to forty a year with four in each state month one of these was now called the main meeting kyria ekklesia additional meetings might still be called especially as up until 355 bc there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court the assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar there was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state monthhttps  booksgooglecom booksid rbcabaaaqbajampdq athens+assembly+frequencyampq %22assembly+normally%22#v snippetampq %22assembly%20normally%22ampf false manville pb the origins of citizenship in ancient athens princeton university press 2014 p 182

as the system evolved the courts that is citizens under another guise intruded upon the power of the assembly from 355 bc political trials were no longer held in the assembly but only in a court in 416 bc the  indictment against measures contrary to the laws was introduced under this anything passed by the assembly or even proposed but not yet voted on could be put on hold for review before a jury – which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well

part of the ethos of democracy however was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement in the 5th century version of the democracy the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent but for those who had power it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly rather than their vested powers
while citizens voting in the assembly were the people and so were free of review or punishment those same citizens when holding an office served the people and could be punished very severely all of them were subject to a review beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination after stepping down officeholders were the agents of the people not their representatives citizens active as office holders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors
the assembly and the courts were regarded as the instantiation of the people of athens they were the people no power was above them and they could not be reviewed impeached or punished however when an athenian took up an office he was regarded as serving the people as such he could be regarded as failing in his duty and be punished for it
there were in fact some limitations on who could hold office age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time an unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement  excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily depending on the type furthermore all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office dokimasia at which they might be disqualified
competence does not seem to have been the main issue but rather at least in the 4th century bc whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies however magistrates after leaving office were subject to a scrutiny euthunai literally straightenings or submission of accounts to review their performance both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic but they opened up in the possibility if some citizen wanted to take some matter up of a contest before a jury courthttps  booksgooglecom booksid iu6eagaaqbajampdq athenian+democracy+thorleyampsource gbs_navlinks_s thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005  ppampnbsp42–43 
in the case of a scrutiny going to trial there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties finally even during his period of office any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly in each of the ten main meetings kuriai ekklesiai a year the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly
by and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited the powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited they administered rather than governed when it came to penal sanctions no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas anything higher had to go before a court
 
the use of a lottery to select officeholders was regarded as the most democratic means elections would favour those who were rich noble eloquent and well known while  spread the work of administration throughout the whole citizen body engaging them in the crucial democratic experience of to use aristotles words ruling and being ruled in turn politics 1317b28–30 the allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought allotment theore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens a unique form of political equality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office samons writes that the system of selection by lottery for members of the council of 500 and other officials like the treasurers of the sacred funds provided a potentially significant check on the dangers of  however this may not have been completely successful as some increasingly pandered to the electorate andampnbsp often told the

the random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks but the system included features meant to obviate possible problems athenians selected for office served as teams boards panels in a group someone will know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do during the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else there were however officials such as the nine archons who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other
no office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual the only exception was the boule or council of 500 in this case simply by demographic necessity an individual could serve twice in a lifetime this principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons to the athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing powerraaflaub kurt a ober josiah and wallace

during an athenian election approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot there were two main categories in this group those required to handle large sums of money and the 10 generals the  one reason that financial officials were elected was that any money  could be recovered from their estates election in general strongly favoured the rich but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite
generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider greek world where wars were fought in the 5th century bc principally as seen through the figure of  the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis yet in the case of pericles it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships each year along with nine others his office holding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded that influence was based on his relation with the assembly a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons in part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialised forms of warfare practiced in the later period
elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office and they too could be removed from office at any time that the assembly met there was also a death penalty for inadequate performance while in office name historyandpolicy 
a good example of the contempt the first democrats felt for those who did not participate in politics can be found in the modern word idiot which finds its origins in the ancient greek word  idiōtēs meaning a private person a person who is not actively interested in politicsgoldhill s 2004 the good citizen in love sex amp tragedy why classics matters john murray london 179 94  such characters were talked about with contempt and the word eventually acquired its modern meaning according to thucydides pericles may have declared in a funeral oration

whether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic or as a product of the extreme conditions of the peloponnesian war there does seem to have been a move toward correction a new version of democracy was established from 403 bc but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent orms  416 bc end of assembly trials 355 bc for instance the system of nomothesia was introduced in thisblockquote
a new law might be proposed by any citizen any proposal to modify an existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law the citizen making the proposal had to publish it in advance publication consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the statues of the eponymous heroes in the agora the proposal would be considered by the council and would be placed on the agenda of the assembly in the form of a motion if the assembly voted in favor of the proposed change the proposal would be erred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai literally establishers of the law name homepagesgacedu   blockquote
increasingly responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts that is to say the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath and with more time to focus on just one matter though never more than a day one downside was that the new democracy was less capable of rapid response
another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of athenian life although democracy predated athenian imperialism by over thirty years they are sometimes associated with each other for much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states  the son of milesias not the historian an aristocrat stood in opposition to these policies for which he was ostracised in 443 bc
at times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality as in the decision to execute the entire male population of  and sell off its women and children simply for using to become subjects of athens the common people were numerically dominant in the navy which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions further they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding this is the position set out by the anti democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the  this writer also called  produced several comments critical of democracy such as

a case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under athenian democracy than before or elsewhere in particular in relation to women and slaves as well as in the line between citizens and non citizens by so strongly validating one role that of the male citizen it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it

a distinctive west arabic variant of the symbols begins to emerge around the 10th century in the  and  called ghubar sand table or dust table numerals which are the direct ancestor of the modern western arabic numerals used throughout the world ghubar numerals themselves are probably of roman origin

the numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right with higher value positions added to the left this arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in europe languages written in the latin alphabet run from left to right unlike languages written in the arabic alphabet hence from the point of view of the reader numerals in western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first
the reason the digits are more commonly known as arabic numerals in europe and the americas is that they were introduced to europe in the 10th century by arabic speakers of north africa who were then using the digits from libya to morocco arabs on the other hand call the system  numerals name uniofnthc1  name twptakeano  erring to their origin in india this is not to be confused with what the arabs call the hindi numerals namely the                             used in the middle east or any of the  in  eg   name ifrah

alexander selkirk 167613 december 1721 also known as alexander selcraig was a scottish sailor who spent more than four years as a  after being  on an uninhabited island in the  also known as the south sea
selkirk was an unruly youth and joined ing expeditions to the  one such expedition was aboard the  commanded by  the ship called in for provisions at the  off chile and selkirk judged correctly that his craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there
by the time that he was rescued he had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island his story of survival was widely publicised when he returned home and became a likely source of inspiration for writer s fictional character  
alexander selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in   scotland born in 1676 in his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition he was summoned before the  in august 1693 for his indecent conduct in church but he did not appear being gone to sea he was back at largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for beating up his brothers
early on he was engaged in buccaneering in 1703 he joined an expedition of english  and explorer  to the  setting sail from  in ireland on 11 september they carried  from the  authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the  was then going on between england and france  dampier was  of the st george and selkirk served on the  st georges companion ship as  under captain  by this time selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea
in february 1704 following a stormy passage round  the privateers fought a long battle with a well armed french vessel the st joseph only to have it escape to warn the spanish of the buccaneers arrival in the pacific a raid failed on the panamanian gold mining town of santa maría when their landing party was ed the easy capture of the asunción a heavily laden merchantman revived the mens hopes of plunder and selkirk was put in charge of the   dampier took off some much needed provisions of wine brandy sugar and flour then abruptly set the ship free believing that the gain was not worth the effort in may 1704 stradling decided to abandon dampier and strike out on his own
in september 1704 after parting ways with dampier captain stradling brought the cinque ports to an island known to the spanish as  located in the uninhabited   off the coast of chile for a mid expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies
selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel and probably wanted to make the needed repairs before going any farther  he declared that he would rather be left on juan fernández than continue in a dangerously leaky ship  stradling granted his request and landed selkirk and his personal effects on the island  selkirk regretted his rashness but stradling used to let him back on board
cinque ports did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now   stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the spanish  the survivors were taken to  peru where they endured a harsh imprisonment
at first selkirk remained along the shoreline of juan fernández  during this time he ate  and scanned the ocean daily for rescue suffering all the while from loneliness misery and remorse  hordes of raucous  gathered on the beach for the mating season and they eventually drove him to the islands interior once inland his way of life took a turn for the better  more foods were available there s—introduced by earlier sailors—provided him with meat and milk while wild s  and dried  offered him variety and spice  s would attack him at night but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near s
selkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island he forged a new knife out of  hoops left on the beach he built two huts out of  trees one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses  as his gunpowder dwindled he had to chase prey on foot  during one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff lying helpless and unable to move for about a day  his prey had cushioned his fall likely sparing him a broken back
his childhood lessons now served him well which he had learned from his father a tanner  for example when his clothes wore out he made new ones from hair covered goatskins using a nail for sewing as his shoes became unusable he had no need to replace them since his toughened callused feet made protection unnecessary he sang  and read from the  finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his english
during his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor  unfortunately for selkirk both were spanish  as a scotsman and a privateer he risked a grim fate if captured and theore tried to hide himself  on one occasion he was spotted and chased by a group of sailors from one of the ships  his pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to discover him  frustrated his would be captors gave up and sailed away
selkirks long awaited deliverance came on 2 february 1709 by way of the duke a privateering ship  by  and its sailing companion the duchess  led the landing party that met selkirk after four years and four months without human company selkirk was almost incoherent with joy the duke captain and leader of the expedition was  who mischievously erred to him as the governor of the island  the agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of rogers men who were suffering from 
captain rogers was impressed by selkirks physical vigour and also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island observing one may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably as this man was he made selkirk the dukes  later giving him command of one of their prize ships the increase before it was ransomed by the spanish
selkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance  at  in present day ecuador he led a boat crew up the  where a number of wealthy spanish ladies had fled and relieved them of the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing his part in the hunt for treasure  along the coast of mexico resulted in the capture of the  renamed batchelor on which he served as sailing master under captain dover to the  selkirk completed the round the world voyage by the  as the sailing master of the duke arriving at  off the english coast on 1 october 1711 he had been away for eight years
selkirks experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in england rogers included an account of selkirks ordeal in a book chronicling their privateering expedition entitled a cruising voyage round the world 1712 the following year prominent essayist  wrote an article about him for the englishman newspaper  selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity claiming his share of the duke plundered wealth—about £800 equivalent to £ today however legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain
after a few months in  he began to seem more like his former self again in september 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in  and may have been kept in confinement for two years he returned to lower largo where he met sophia bruce a young dairymaid they eloped to london early in 1717 but apparently did not marry he was soon off to sea again having enlisted in the  while on a visit to  in 1720 he married a widowed innkeeper named frances candis he was serving as  on board  engaged in an anti  patrol off the west coast of africa when he died on 13 december 1721 succumbing to the  that plagued the voyage  he was buried at sea
when  published  1719 few readers could have missed the resemblance to selkirk  an illustration on the first page of the novel shows a rather melancholy looking man standing on the shore of an island gazing inland in the words of modern explorer  he is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins his feet and shins bare yet crusoes island is located not in the  of the south pacific but  away in the  where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the  heat  this incongruity supports the popular belief that selkirk was a model for the fictional character
 s the solitude of alexander selkirk is about selkirks feelings as the castaway lived all alone on the island  this poem gave rise to the common phrase monarch of all i survey via the verse
poemi am monarch of all i survey
my right there is none to dispute
from the centre all round to the sea

an anti ballistic missile abm is a  designed to counter s see  ballistic missiles are used to deliver    or conventional s in a  flight  the term anti ballistic missile is commonly used for systems designed to counter s icbms
there are only two systems in the world that can intercept icbms besides them many smaller systems exist tactical abms that generally cannot intercept intercontinental strategic missiles even if within range—an incoming icbm simply moves too fast for these systems
the russian  used for the defense of moscow whose development started in 1971 the currently active system is called  the system uses gorgon and  missiles with s to intercept incoming

during spring 2006 reports about negotiations between the united states and poland as well as the czech republic were published the plans propose the installation of a latest generation abm system with a radar site in the czech republic and the  the system was announced to be aimed against icbms from iran and north korea this caused harsh comments by russias then   at the  osce security conference during spring 2007 in munich other european ministers commented that any change of strategic weapons should be negotiated on  level and not unilaterally between the us and other states although most strategic arms reduction treaties were between the soviet union and us not nato german foreign minister  expressed severe concerns about the way in which the us had conveyed its plans to its european partners and criticised the us administration for not having consulted russia prior to announcing its endeavours to deploy a new missile defence system in central europegaspers j 2007 http  wwwhsfkde fileadmin content abm natolin_analiza_7_2007pdf a us missile defence shield in europe opinions and arguments in the german political debate natolin analyses 720 2007  as of july 2007 a majority of poles were opposed to hosting a component of the system in poland name wp_antimissile

along with the pac 3 japan has installed a us developed ship based anti ballistic missile system which was tested successfully on 18 december 2007 the missile was launched from a japanese warship in partnership with the us missile defense agency and destroyed a mock target launched from the coast

adenosine triphosphate atp is a  used in  as a  often called the  unit of  of intracellular  
atp transports chemical energy within  for  it is one of the end products of   and  and used by s and  in many cellular processes including   and   one molecule of atp contains three  groups and it is produced by a wide variety of enzymes including  from  adp or  amp and various phosphate group donors   in  and  in  are three major mechanisms of atp biosynthesis
metabolic processes that use atp as an energy source convert it back into its  atp is theore continuously recycled in organisms the human body which on average contains only  of atp  turns over its own body weight equivalent in atp each day 
atp is used as a  in  pathways by s that  s and s it is also used by  which uses atp to produce the  molecule  the ratio between atp and amp is used as a way for a cell to sense how much energy is available and control the s that produce and consume atp  apart from its roles in signaling and energy metabolism atp is also incorporated into s by s in the process of  atp is the neurotransmitter believed to signal the sense of taste 
the structure of this molecule consists of a  base  attached by the 9 nitrogen atom to the 1 carbon atom of a  sugar  three phosphate groups are attached at the 5 carbon atom of the pentose sugar it is the addition and removal of these phosphate groups that inter convert atp  and amp when atp is used in dna synthesis the ribose sugar is first converted to  by 
atp was discovered in 1929 by karl lohmann  and independently by cyrus fiske and  of   but its correct structure was not determined until some years later it was proposed to be the intermediary molecule between energy yielding and energy requiring reactions in cells by  in 1941  it was first artificially synthesized by  in 1948 
atp consists of ampnbsp— composed of an  ring and a  sugarampnbsp— and three  groups triphosphate the phosphoryl groups starting with the group closest to the ribose are erred to as the alpha α beta β and gamma γ phosphates consequently it is closely related to the adenosine nucleotide a  of  atp is highly soluble in water and is quite stable in solutions between phampnbsp68 and 74 but is rapidly  at extreme ph consequently atp is best stored as an anhydrous salt 
atp is an unstable molecule in  water in which it  to  and phosphate this is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in atp is less than the strength of the s hydration bonds between its products adp + phosphate and water thus if atp and adp are in  in water almost all of the atp will eventually be converted to adp a system that is far from equilibrium contains  and is capable of doing  living cells maintain the ratio of atp to adp at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium with atp concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of adp this displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of atp in the cell releases a large amount of free energy name nicholls 
two  bonds those that connect adjacent phosphates in an atp molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule name stryer p376  in the context of biochemical reactions these anhydride bonds are frequently—and sometimes controversially—erred to as  despite the fact it takes energy to break bonds  energy stored in atp may be released upon  of the anhydride bonds name stryer p376  the primary phosphate group on the atp molecule that is hydrolyzed when energy is needed to drive anabolic reactions is the γ phosphate group located the farthest from the ribose sugar it has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either the α  or β phosphate the bonds formed after hydrolysis—or the phosphorylation of a residue by atp—are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of atp during enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of atp or phosphorylation by atp the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work  
any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy if the cell maintained their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction name nicholls  however as is the case with most polymeric biomolecules the breakdown of rna dna and atp into simpler monomers is driven by both energy release and entropy increase considerations in both standard concentrations and also those concentrations encountered within the cell
the standard amount of energy released from hydrolysis of atp can be calculated from the changes in energy under non natural standard conditions then correcting to biological concentrations the net change in heat energy  at  of the decomposition of atp into hydrated adp and hydrated inorganic phosphate is −305ampnbsp with a change in  of 34ampnbspkj mol  the energy released by cleaving either a phosphate psubi sub or pyrophosphate ppsubi sub unit from atp at  of 1ampnbspm are 
atp +  → adp + psubi sub  Δg˚   −305ampnbspkj mol −73ampnbspkcal mol
atp +  → amp + ppsubi sub  Δg˚   −456ampnbspkj mol −109ampnbspkcal mol
these values can be used to calculate the change in energy under physiological conditions and the cellular atp adp ratio however a more representative value which takes amp into consideration called the  is increasingly being employed the values given for the  for this reaction are dependent on a number of factors including overall ionic strength and the presence of  ions such as  and  under typical cellular conditions Δg is approximately −57ampnbspkj mol −14ampnbspkcal mol 
atp adenosine triphosphate has multiple groups with different s in neutral solution atp is ionized exists mostly as atpsup4− sup with a small proportion of atpsup3− sup name storer  as atp has several negatively charged groups in neutral solution it can  metals with very high affinity the  for various metal ions are given as per mole as  9 554  13  3 722  8  1 381 and  25  due to the strength of these interactions atp exists in the cell mostly in a complex with  name storer  
the atp  inside the cell is typically 1–10 
  atp can be produced by  reactions using simple and complex sugars s or s as an energy source for complex fuels to be synthesized into atp they first need to be broken down into smaller more simple molecules carbohydrates are  into simple sugars such as  and  fats s are metabolised to give  and 
the overall process of oxidizing glucose to  is known as  and can produce about 30 molecules of atp from a single molecule of glucose name rich  atp can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes the three main pathways used to generate energy in  organisms are  and the   both components of  and  the majority of this atp production by a non  aerobic eukaryote takes place in the  which can make up nearly 25% of the total volume of a typical cell name lodish 
in glycolysis glucose and glycerol are metabolized to  via the glycolytic pathway in most organisms this process occurs in the  but in some protozoa such as the s this is carried out in a specialized  called the   glycolysis generates a net two molecules of atp through  catalyzed by two enzymes  and  two molecules of  are also produced which can be oxidized via the  and result in the generation of additional atp by  the pyruvate generated as an end product of glycolysis is a substrate for the  name voet 
in the  pyruvate is oxidized by the  to acetyl group which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle also known as the krebs cycle every turn of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of  one molecule of the atp equivalent  gtp through  catalyzed by  three molecules of the reduced   and one molecule of the reduced coenzyme  both of these latter molecules are recycled to their oxidized states nadsup+ sup and  respectively via the  which generates additional atp by  the oxidation of an nadh molecule results in the synthesis of 2–3 atp molecules and the oxidation of one fadhsub2 sub yields between 1–2 atp molecules name rich  the majority of cellular atp is generated by this process although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular  it is an obligately  process because  is needed to recycle the reduced nadh and fadhsub2 sub to their oxidized states in the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available nadsup+ sup and fad name lodish 
the generation of atp by the mitochondrion from cytosolic nadh relies on the  and to a lesser extent the  because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to nadh and nadsup+ sup instead of transferring the generated nadh a  enzyme converts  to  which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix another malate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction producing oxaloacetate and nadh from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrions interior store of nadsup+ sup a  converts the oxaloacetate to  for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space name lodish   will put the antiporter full cycle in the shuttle article  
in oxidative phosphorylation the passage of electrons from nadh and fadhsub2 sub through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space this creates a  that is the net effect of a  gradient and an  gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane flow of protons down this potential gradientampnbsp— that is from the intermembrane space to the matrixampnbsp— provides the driving force for atp synthesis by  this  contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during atp synthesis 
most of the atp synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix the inner membrane contains an  the  atp translocase which is an  used to exchange newly synthesized atp in the matrix for  in the intermembrane space name brandolin  this translocase is driven by the membrane potential as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside however it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate partially dissipating the proton gradient
fatty acids can also be broken down to  by  each round of this cycle reduces the length of the acyl chain by two carbon atoms and produces one nadh and one fadhsub2 sub molecule which are used to generate atp by oxidative phosphorylation because nadh and fadhsub2 sub are energy rich molecules dozens of atp molecules can be generated by the beta oxidation of a single long acyl chain the high energy yield of this process and the compact storage of fat explain why it is the most dense source of dietary s

anaerobic respiration is the process of respiration using an  other than  in prokaryotes multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration these include   or carbon dioxide these processes lead to the ecologically important processes of  sulfate reduction and  respectively  
atp can also be synthesized through several so called replenishment reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of s ndks which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high energy phosphate donor and the  family
in plants atp is synthesized in  of the  during the s of  in a process called photophosphorylation here light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane this produces a proton motive force and this drives the atp synthase exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation  some of the atp produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the  which produces  sugars
the total quantity of atp in the human body is about 02ampnbsp the majority of atp is not usually  but is generated from  by the aforementioned processes thus at any given time the total amount of atp +  remains fairly constant
the energy used by human cells requires the  of 100 to 150ampnbspmoles of atp daily which is around 50 to 75ampnbspkg a human will typically use up his or her body weight of atp over the course of the day name di carlo  this means that each atp molecule is recycled 500 to 750 times during a single day 100   02   500 atp cannot be stored hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis however a total of around 5g of atp is used by cell processes at any time in the body
atp production in an aerobic eukaryotic cell is tightly regulated by  mechanisms by  effects and by the substrate concentration dependence of individual enzymes within the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions
in glycolysis  is directly inhibited by its product glucose 6 phosphate and  is inhibited by atp itself the main control point for the glycolytic pathway is  pfk which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of atp and activated by high concentrations of amp the inhibition of pfk by atp is unusual since atp is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by pfk the biologically active form of the enzyme is a  that exists in two possible conformations only one of which binds the second substrate fructose 6 phosphate f6p the protein has two s for atpampnbsp— the  is accessible in either protein conformation but atp binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds f6p poorly name voet   a number of other small molecules can compensate for the atp induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate pfk including   ions inorganic phosphate and fructose 16 and 26 biphosphate name voet 
the citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates particularly the ratio of nadsup+ sup to nadh and the concentrations of  inorganic phosphate atp  and amp  — the molecule that gives its name to the cycleampnbsp— is a feedback inhibitor of  and also inhibits pfk providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis name voet 
in oxidative phosphorylation the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by  which is regulated by the availability of its substrate—the reduced form of  the amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates
math
\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{nadh} + \mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}} + \mathrm{adp} + p_i \iff \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{nad^{+}} + \mathrm{cyt~c_{red}} + \mathrm{atp}
 math
which directly implies this equation
math
\frac{\mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}}{\mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}}   \left\frac{\mathrm{nadh}}{\mathrm{nad}^{+}}\right^{\frac{1}{2}}\left\frac{\mathrm{adp} p_i}{\mathrm{atp}}\rightk_{eq}
 math
thus a high ratio of nadh to nadsup+ sup or a high ratio of adp psubi sub to atp imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity name voet  an additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of atp and nadh between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm name brandolin 
atp is consumed in the cell by energy requiring endergonic processes and can be generated by energy releasing exergonic processes in this way atp transfers energy between spatially separate  atp is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions this includes the synthesis of macromolecules including  and  see below and  atp also plays a critical role in the  of macromolecules across cell membranes eg  and 
atp is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the  in a related process atp is required for the  required for  this latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for  and 
 
atp is also a  atp adp or adenosine are recognised by  purinoreceptors might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues name abbracchio09 
in humans this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system name harvard  activity dependent release of atp from synapses axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as p2  the  receptors are metabotropic ie  and modulate mainly intracellular calcium and sometimes cyclic amp levels though named between p2ysub1 sub and p2ysub15 sub only nine members of the p2y family have been cloned and some are only related through weak homology and several p2ysub5 sub p2ysub7 sub p2ysub9 sub p2ysub10 sub do not function as receptors that raise cytosolic calcium the  ionotropic receptor subgroup comprises seven members p2xsub1 sub–p2xsub7 sub which are ligand gated  permeable ion channels that open when bound to an extracellular purine nucleotide in contrast to p2 receptors agonist order atp    amp  ado purinergic nucleoside triphosphates like atp are not strong agonists of p1 receptors which are strongly activated by  and other s ado  amp    atp p1 receptors have a1 a2a a2b and a3 subtypes a as a remnant of old nomenclature of adenosine receptor all of which are g protein coupled receptors a1 and a3 being coupled to gi and a2a and a2b being coupled to gs 
  this is an awful lot of detail on the receptors without a lot of information on the function of the receptors and their importance  
all adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen activated protein kinases the actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of atp in the cns adenosine has multiple functions such as modulation of neural development neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems name abbracchio09 
 
atp is critical in  processes it is used by s as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions kinase activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction  of a protein by a kinase can activate this cascade such as the  cascade 
atp is also used by  and is transformed to the  molecule cyclic amp which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores  this form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes 
in all known organisms the deoxyribonucleotides that make up  are synthesized by the action of  rnr enzymes on their corresponding  name stubbe  these enzymes reduce the sugar residue from  to  by removing oxygen from the 2  group the substrates are ribonucleoside diphosphates and the products deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates the latter are denoted dadp dcdp dgdp and dudp respectively all ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common   mechanism reliant on reactive  residues that oxidize to form s in the course of the reaction name stubbe  rnr enzymes are recycled by reaction with  or  name voet  
the regulation of rnr and related enzymes maintains a balance of dntps relative to each other and relative to ntps in the cell very low dntp concentration inhibits  and  and is lethal to the cell while an abnormal ratio of dntps is ic due to the increased likelihood of the  incorporating the wrong dntp during dna synthesis name voet   regulation of or differential specificity of rnr has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dntp pools under cellular stress such as  name chimploy 
in the synthesis of the   adenosine derived from atp is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into rna molecules by s the energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate two phosphate groups  the process is similar in dna biosynthesis except that atp is reduced to the  datp before incorporation into dna
aminoacyl trna synthetase enzymes utilise atp as an energy source to attach a trna molecule to its specific amino acid forming an aminoacyl trna complex ready for  at s the energy is made available by atp hydrolysis to  amp as two phosphate groups are removed
amino acid activation ers to the attachment of an amino acid to its transfer rna trna
    aminoacyl transferase binds adenosine triphosphate atp to amino acid pp is released
    aminoacyl transferase binds amp amino acid to trna the amp is used in this step
during amino acid activation the amino acids aa are attached to their corresponding trna the coupling reactions are catalysed by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl trna synthetases named after the reaction product aminoacyl trna or aa trna the coupling reaction proceeds in two steps
1 aa + atp aa amp + pp pyrophosphate 2 aa amp + trna aa trna + amp
the amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3’ end of the trna the a in the sequence cca via an ester bond roll over in illustration the formation of the ester bond conserves a considerable part of the energy from the activation reaction this stored energy provides the majority of the energy needed for peptide bond formation during translation
each of the 20 amino acids are recognized by its specific aminoacyl trna synthetase the synthetases are usually composed of one to four protein subunits the enzymes vary considerably in structure although they all perform the same type of reaction by binding atp one specific amino acid and its corresponding trna
the specificity of the amino acid activation is as critical for the translational accuracy as the correct matching of the codon with the anticodon the reason is that the ribosome only sees the anticodon of the trna during translation thus the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between trnas with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids

the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors these include  the location of infection and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial name pankey2004  a bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells name bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary phase and nondividing staphylococcus aureus cells  these findings are based on laboratory studies and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection name pankey2004   since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration name rhee2004  in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the  and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial name pankey2004  name agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration micof antimicrobial substances 
to predict clinical outcome the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its  profile and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy 
antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action chemical structure or spectrum of activity most target bacterial functions or growth processes name calderin2007  those that target the bacterial cell wall s and s or the cell membrane  or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes s s s and  have  activities those that target protein synthesis s  and s are usually  with the exception of bactericidal s name the importance of bactericidal drugs future directions in infectious disease  further categorization is based on their target specificity narrow spectrum antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria such as  or  bacteria whereas broad spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria following a 40 year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s cyclic  such as   such as  s such as  and s such as cunha ba antibiotic essentials 2009 jones amp bartlett learning isbn 978 0 7637 7219 2 p 180 for example  
with advances in  most modern antibacterials are  modifications of various natural compounds  these include for example the  which include the s produced by fungi in the genus  the s and the s compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the s whereas other antibacterials—for example the  the s and the s—are produced solely by  in accordance with this many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical  origin into natural semisynthetic and synthetic another classification system is based on biological activity in this classification antibacterials are divided into two broad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms  agents kill bacteria and s slow down or stall bacterial growth
many antibacterial compounds are relatively s with a  of less than 2000 s
since the first pioneering efforts of  and  in 1939 the importance of antibiotics including antibacterials to  has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria production of the active compounds is carried out using  usually in strongly aerobic conditions 
oral antibiotics are taken by mouth whereas  administration may be used in more serious cases  such as deep seated s antibiotics may also sometimes be administered ly as with s or s
the topical antibiotics are 
 erythromycin
 clindamycin
 gentamycin
 tetracycline
 meclocycline
 sodium sulfacetamide
while topical medications that act as comedolytics as well as antibiotics are
 benzoyl peroxide
 azelaic acid
antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated however some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse  name pmid15993671 
side effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used the microbial organisms targeted and the individual patient safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use name pmid15993671  adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions including  and anaphylaxis common side effects include  resulting from disruption of the species composition in the  resulting for example in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as   antibacterials can also affect the  and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus  in the vulvo vaginal area name pirotta and garland  additional side effects can result from interaction with other drugs such as elevated risk of  damage from administration of a  antibiotic with a systemic  some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with   
the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with s name weaver1999  such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low about 1% name pmid10384856  in cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills such as for the broad spectrum antibacterial  these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes causing increased breakdown of the pills active ingredients name weaver1999  effects on the intestinal flora which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon have also been suggested but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial name pmid3155374  name pmid2256523  clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives name weaver1999 
interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy name bmj  name antibiotics and alcohol 
it is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medication however it is unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics however there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol should be avoided completely because of serious side effects name nhs  
theore potential risks of side effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered despite the lack of a categorical counterindication the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread
antibiotics such as       and  cause a  like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by  which may result in vomiting nausea and shortness of breath name nhs 
other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound name antibiotics faq  in addition serum levels of doxycycline and  succinate two bacteriostatic antibiotics see above may be reduced by alcohol consumption resulting in reduced efficacy and diminished pharmacotherapeutic effect name  stockley2002 
the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon emergence of resistance often lects ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy the antibiotic treatment may  for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics under certain conditions it may result in perential growth of resistant bacteria while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug name balancing the drug resistance equation  for example antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the  name mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance  antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains have become less effective due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains name voanewscom 
resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals such as sulfamethazine degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces 
the survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance name witte2004  but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through  horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use name a field guide to bacteria the world of bacteria 
antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost thereby reducing  of resistant strains which can limit the spread of antibacterial resistant bacteria for example in the absence of antibacterial compounds additional mutations however may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria name the biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance any practical conclusions 
paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms name dcosta2011  useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability name gladki2013 
several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains name alekshun2007  for example an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial  acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra chromosomal dna name alekshun2007  antibacterial producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to and may have been transferred to antibacterial resistant strains name glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide producing organisms  name multidrug resistance in bacteria  the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by  name witte2004  for instance antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via  that carry these resistance genes name witte2004  name baker2006  plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials name baker2006  cross resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound name baker2006 
antibacterial resistant strains and species sometimes erred to as superbugs now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled for example emergent bacterial strains causing  tb that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges every year nearly half a million new cases of  mdr tb are estimated to occur worldwidehttp  wwwwhoint mediacentre news releases 2009 tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402 en indexhtml health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug resistant tb world health organization who  for example  is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of  antibacterials name are you ready for a world without antibiotics  the united kingdoms  has stated that most isolates with ndm 1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections name health protection report 
per the the icu book the first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them and the second rule is try not to use too many of them name marino 
inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria  of antibiotics is an example of misuse name larson2007  many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment also incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections name pmid15993671  name larson2007  the overuse of antibiotics like penicillin and erythromycin has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s name voanewscom  name hawkey2008  widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics name hawkey2008 
common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of  antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patients weight and history of prior use other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic incorrect dosage and administration or failure to rest for sufficient recovery inappropriate antibiotic treatment for example is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the  one study on s found physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them name pmid17467120  multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics name pmid17509729  name cochrane review on shared decision making and antibiotics prescription 
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics name larson2007  the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance and is coordinated by the us  the  fda and the  nih as well as other us agencies name pharmguide  an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working name keep antibiotics working  in france an antibiotics are not automatic government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions especially in children 
the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970 swann report 1969 and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth promotional agents since 2003 name urlregulation ec no 1831 2003 of the european parliament and of the council  moreover several organizations eg the american society for microbiology asm american public health association apha and the american medical association ama have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses  however commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them two federal bills s742 name usbill1  and hr 2562 name usbill2  aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in us food animals were proposed but have not passed name usbill1  name usbill2  these bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations including the american holistic nurses association the american medical association and the american public health association apha 
there has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry in the united states the question of emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains due to  was raised by the us  fda in 1977 in march 2012 the united states district court for the southern district of new york ruling in an action brought by the  and others ordered the fda to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated fda regulations name mpfda 
the increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of bacterial disease treatment strategies that are alternatives to conventional antibacterials
one strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials for example some resistance modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms such as  from the cell thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial targets include
 the  phe arg β naphthylamide 
 s such as  and 
metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active 
s rely on  modulation or augmentation vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection leading to the activation of  the production of   and other classic immune reactions antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases  vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic cell free vaccines consisting of purified components including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates to protein carriers as well as inactivated toxins toxoids and proteins name milleraamillerpf 
 is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria the way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses more specifically s bacteriophages also known simply as phages are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium s name sulakvelidze  by disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium phages destroy their metabolism which eventually results in the cells death name sulakvelidze  phages will insert their dna into the bacterium allowing their dna to be transcribed once their dna is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released the cell will lyse name sulakvelidze  one of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings however studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria name sulakvelidze 
some over the counter  supplements containing polyphenols such as  demonstrate  anti bacterial properties   
in april 2013 the  idsa reported that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria’s increasing ability to develop resistance since 2009 only 2 new antibiotics were approved in the united states the number of new antibiotics approved for marketing per year declines continuously the report identified seven antibiotics against the  gnb currently in  or  clinical trials however these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of resistance of gnb  name idsa2013 
some of these antibiotics are combination of existent treatments

 and  are antagonists to  and   this means the combined effect of two antibiotics from separate groups can be less than a single antibiotic  however this can vary depending on the species of bacteria 
before the early 20th century treatments for infections were based primarily on  mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago name considerations for determining if a natural product is an effective wound healing agent  many ancient cultures including the  and  used specially selected  and plant materials and extracts to treat s name early history of wound treatment  name moulds in ancient and more recent medicine  more recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms  observed if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics name kingston2008 
the term antibiosis meaning against life was introduced by the french bacteriologist  as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs name calderin2007  name early descriptions of antibiosis  antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when louis pasteur and  observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of   these drugs were later renamed antibiotics by  an american microbiologist in 1942 name calderin2007  name wakeman1947  synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in germany with  in the late 1880s name calderin2007  ehrlich noted  certain dyes would color human animal or bacterial cells whereas others did not he then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host after screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms in 1907 he discovered a medicinally useful drug the synthetic antibacterial  name calderin2007  name limbird2004  name bosch2008  now called arsphenamine
the effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history see  in 1928  noticed the same effect in a  where a number of disease causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus penicillium fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named  and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy he initially characterized some of its biological properties and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists name fleming1929  name sykes2001

florey and chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin  in 1942 but it did not become widely available outside the allied military before 1945 the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by  in 1945 purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans furthermore its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus unlike the synthetic sulfonamides the discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety name use of micro organisms for therapeutic purposes  for their successful development of penicillin which fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself as a therapeutic drug  and  shared the 1945  with fleming florey credited dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived floreys research in penicillin name epps2006

in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments  his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience

classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the  later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of s major work capital was published in german in 1867 in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital name roemer 1987 marxian value analysis  v 3 383  1987 marx karl heinrich the new palgrave a dictionary of economics v 3 pp 372 376  the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of  that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing

the bicentennial anniversary of the publication of the wealth of nations was celebrated in 1976 resulting in increased interest for the theory of moral sentiments and his other works throughout academia after 1976 smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics his  or economic man was also more often represented as a moral person additionally economists david levy and sandra peart in the secret history of the dismal science point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality including racial inequality and provide additional support for those who point to smiths opposition to slavery colonialism and empire  they show the caricatures of smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article emphasised also are smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor and the efforts to keep wages low in the vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics peart and levy also cite smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher  and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical they also cite smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sensethe vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics http  wwwwfuedu ~hammond review%20of%20peartamplevy%20finalpdf 
smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government

it is generally accepted that lavoisiers great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role  plays in  he recognized and named  1778 and  1783 and opposed the  lavoisier helped construct the  wrote the first extensive  and helped to orm  he predicted the existence of  1787in his table of the elements lavoisier listed five salifiable earths ie ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts salis   salt in latin  chaux calcium oxide magnésie magnesia magnesium oxide baryte barium sulfate alumine alumina aluminum oxide and silice silica silicon dioxide about these elements lavoisier speculates  we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses are incapable hitherto of being reduced to a metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds are confounded with earths it is extremely probable that barytes which we have just now arranged with earths is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds irreducible by any hitherto known process – from https  booksgooglecom booksid adykaaaaiaajamppg pa218#v onepageampqampf false page 218 of   lavoisier with robert kerr trans elements of chemistry  4th ed edinburgh scotland william creech 1799  the original passage appears in lavoisier traité Élémentaire de chimie   paris france cuchet 1789 vol 1 https  booksgooglecom booksid hzch3yorayucamppg pa174#v onepageampqampf false page 174  and was also the first to establish that  was an element 1777 rather than a compoundcmichael hogan 2011 http  wwweoearthorg article sulfurtopic 49557 sulfur encyclopedia of earth eds a jorgensen and cjcleveland national council for science and the environment washington dc  he discovered that although matter may change its form or shape 
lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of  councils and an administrator of the  the ferme générale was one of the most hated components of the  because of the profits it took at the expense of the state the secrecy of the terms of its contracts and the violence of its armed agents  all of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research at the height of the  he was accused by  of selling adulterated  and of other crimes and was eventually  a year after marats death
antoine laurent lavoisier was born to a wealthy family in paris on 26 august 1743 the son of an attorney at the parliament of paris he inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother  lavoisier began his schooling at the   known as the collège mazarin in paris in 1754 at the age of 11 in his last two years 1760–1761 at the school his scientific interests were aroused and he studied    and mathematics in the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of  a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation an enthusiasm which never left him lavoisier entered the school of law where he received a bachelors degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764 lavoisier received a  and was admitted to the  but never practiced as a lawyer however he continued his scientific education in his spare time
lavoisiers education was filled with the ideals of the french  of the time and he was fascinated by s dictionary of chemistry he attended lectures in the natural sciences lavoisiers devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by  a prominent french scholar of the 18th century his first chemical publication appeared in 1764 from 1763 to 1767 he studied geology under  in collaboration with guettard lavoisier worked on a geological survey of  in june 1767 in 1764 he read his first paper to the  frances most elite scientific society on the chemical and physical properties of  hydrated  and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the king for an essay on the problems of urban  in 1768 lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the academy of sciences in 1769 he worked on the first geological map of france
at the age of 26 around the time he was elected to the academy of sciences lavoisier bought a share in the  a  financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes his participation in the french government and the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the  began in france as taxes and poor government orm were the primary motivators during the french revolution lavoisier attempted to introduce orms in the french  and taxation system to help the peasants while in government work he helped develop the  to secure uniformity of  throughout france lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when in 1771 at age 28 he married  the 13 year old daughter of a senior member of the ferme généralehttp  wwwcnrsfr cw dossiers doslavoisier contenu alternative alter2_texteshtml lavoisier le parcours dun scientifique révolutionnaire  she was to play an important part in lavoisiers scientific career—notably she translated english documents for him including s essay on phlogiston and s research in addition she assisted him in the laboratory and created many  and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works
madame lavoisier edited and published antoines memoirs whether any english translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry  for 3 years following his entry into the ferme générale lavoisiers scientific activity diminished somewhat for much of his time was taken up with official ferme générale business he did however present one important memoir to the academy of sciences during this period on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation by a very precise quantitative experiment lavoisier showed that the earthy sediment produced after long continued lux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water
during late 1772 lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of  the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science he reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the academy on 20 october in which he reported that when  burned it combined with a large quantity of air to produce  and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning in a second sealed note deposited with the academy a few weeks later 1 november lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of  and went on to add that what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination and i am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause
 
during 1773 lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air particularly fixed air and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field he published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled opuscules physiques et chimiques physical and chemical essays in the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of  the scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali for example   and the caustic form for example   lay in the fact that the former contained fixed air not common air fixed in the chalk but a distinct chemical species now understood to be  cosub2 sub which was a constituent of the atmosphere lavoisier recognized that blacks fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with the charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be blacks fixed air that is cosub2 sub
 
in the spring of 1774 lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air but the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air in october the english chemist  visited paris where he met lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the  of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance the result was his famous memoir on the nature of the principle which combines with metals during their calcination and increases their weight read to the academy on 26 april 1775 commonly erred to as the easter memoir in the original memoir lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with  giving off blacks fixed air in the process name in frenchhttp  wwwlavoisiercnrsfr ice ice_page_detailphplang framptype textampbdd lavosieramptable lavoisierampbookid 26amptypeofbookdes memoiresamppageorder 1ampfacsimile offampsearch no in french and http  weblemoyneedu ~giunta lavoisier1html memoir on combustion in general english translation  when reduced without charcoal it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way he concluded that this was just a pure form of common air and that it was the air itself undivided without alteration without decomposition which combined with metals on calcination
after returning from paris priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx his results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration inflammation and  every other use of common air he called the air dephlogisticated air as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston since it was theore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained
 
the official version of lavoisiers easter memoir appeared in 1778 in the intervening period lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of priestleys latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own in addition to studying priestleys dephlogisticated air he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined he showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties thus when the revised version of the easter memoir was published in 1778 lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air or the eminently respirable part of the air in the following year lavoisier coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air from the greek words meaning acid former name in french  and considérations générales sur la nature des acides general considerations on the nature of acids 1778http  wwwlavoisiercnrsfr ice ice_page_detailphplang framptype textampbdd lavosieramptable lavoisierampbookid 31amptypeofbookdes amppageorder 1ampfacsimile offampsearch no in french  he was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur phosphorus charcoal and nitrogen were acidic he held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was theore the acidifying principle
 
lavoisiers chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion in 1783 he read to the academy his famous paper entitled réflexions sur le phlogistique reflections on phlogiston a full scale attack on the current  of combustion that year lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of s inflammable air which lavoisier termed   for water former with dephlogisticated air oxygen by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases all of the researchers noted the production of water but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory in cooperation with mathematician  lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury the quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element as had been thought for over 2000 years but a compound of two gases hydrogen and oxygen
lavoisiers researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties especially in connection with the ferme générale there were also innumerable reports for and committees of the academy of sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government lavoisier whose organizing skills were outstanding frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports in 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company similar to the ferme générale which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying france with its munitions requirements as a result of his efforts both the quantity and quality of french  greatly improved and it became a source of revenue for the government his appointment to the gunpowder commission brought one great benefit to lavoisiers scientific career as well as a commissioner he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the royal arsenal here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792

lavoisier together with   and  submitted a new program for the orms of  to the academy in 1787 for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time the new system was tied inextricably to lavoisiers new oxygen theory of chemistry the  of earth air fire and water were discarded and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements the elements included light  matter of heat the principles of oxygen hydrogen and azote  carbon sulfur phosphorus the yet unknown radicals of muriatic acid   and fluoric acid 17 metals 5 earths mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as   and  three alkalies   and  and the radicals of 19 organic acids the acids regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids phosphoric and phosphorus acids nitric and nitrous acids the ic termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the ous ending similarly salts of the ic acids were given the terminal letters ate as in copper sulfate whereas the salts of the ous acids terminated with the suffix ite as in copper sulfite the total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name  with the old term vitriol of venus lavoisier described this system of nomenclature in méthode de nomenclature chimique method of chemical nomenclature 1787
lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his  elementary treatise on chemistry published in 1789 this work represents the synthesis of lavoisiers contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern  on the subject the core of the work was the oxygen theory and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines it presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry contained a clear statement of the law of  and denied the existence of phlogiston this text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis and presented lavoisiers theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements it remains a classic in the history of science while many leading chemists of the time used to accept lavoisiers new ideas demand for traité élémentaire as a textbook in edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into english within about a year of its french publicationsee the advertisement p vi of kerrs translation and pp xxvi–xxvii xxviii of douglas mckies introduction to the dover edition  in any event the traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation
the relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes lavoisier was almost obliged theore to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of  his first memoirs on this topic were read to the academy of sciences in 1777 but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782 1783 in association with  the result of this work was published in a famous memoir on heat lavoisier and laplace designed an ice  apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration the outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow which melted to maintain a constant temperature of  around an inner shell filled with ice by measuring the quantity of  and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process lavoisier stated la respiration est donc une combustion that is respiratory gas exchange is a combustion like that of a candle burninghttp  wwwajcnorg cgi content full 79 5 899s is a calorie a calorie american journal of clinical nutrition vol 79 no 5 899s–906s may 2004 
this continuous slow combustion which they supposed took place in the lungs enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789–1790 in cooperation with  they designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body  and respiration using seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the revolution but lavoisiers pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come
as the  gained momentum from 1789 on lavoisiers world inexorably collapsed around him attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular ferme générale and it was eventually suppressed in 1791 in 1792 lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the gunpowder commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the royal arsenal on 8 august 1793 all the learned societies including the academy of sciences were suppressed
it is difficult to assess lavoisiers own attitude to the political turmoil like so many intellectual liberals he felt that the  could be ormed from the inside if only reason and moderation prevailed characteristically one of his last major works was a proposal to the  for the orm of french education he tried to remain aloof from the political cockpit no doubt fearful and uncomprehending of the violence he saw therein however on 24 november 1793 the arrest of all the former tax gatherers was ordered he was branded a traitor by the convention under  during the  in 1794 actions such as attacking distinguished academics such as antoine lavoisier helped to establish robespierre as a tyrant and intolerant of progress eventually this would be one of the keys to his downfall lavoisier had also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign born scientists including mathematician  which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom  lavoisier was tried convicted and guillotined on 8 may 1794 in paris at the age of 50 along with his 27 co defendantshttp  wwwappcom viewart 20130508 njnews18 305080042 today history today in history 1794 antoine lavoisier the father of modern chemistry is executed on the guillotine during france’s reign of terror 
according to a probably apocryphal story the appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge la république na pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes  le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu the republic needs neither scientists nor chemists the course of justice cannot be delayed
commenting on this quotation denis duveen an english expert on lavoiser and a collector of his works wrote that it is pretty certain that it was never uttered for duveens evidence see the following   lavoisier was convicted with summary justice of having plundered the people and the treasury of france of having adulterated the nations tobacco with water and of having supplied the enemies of france with huge sums of money from the national treasury
lavoisiers importance to science was expressed by  who lamented the beheading by saying il ne leur a fallu qu’un moment pour faire tomber cette tête et cent années peut être ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable it took them only an instant to cut off this head and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like  
 
a year and a half after his death lavoisier was exonerated by the french government during the   his private belongings were delivered to his widow a brief note was included reading to the widow of lavoisier who was falsely convicted
about a century after his death a statue of lavoisier was erected in paris it was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied lavoisiers head for the statue but used a spare head of the  the secretary of the academy of sciences during lavoisiers last years lack of money prevented alterations from being made the statue was melted down during the second world war and has not since been replaced however one of the main s high schools in paris and a street in the  are named after lavoisier and statues of him are found on the  and on the façade of the cour napoléon of the  his name is one of the  of eminent french scientists engineers and mathematicians inscribed on the  as well as on buildings around killian court at  in  us
lavoisier is  and as such he defended his faith against those who attempted to use science to attack it louis edouard grimaux author of the standard french biography of lavoisier and the first biographer to obtain access to lavoisiers papers writes the following blockquoteraised in a pious family which had given many priests to the church he had held to his beliefs to  an english author who had sent him a controversial work he wrote you have done a noble thing in upholding revelation and the authenticity of the holy scripture and it is remarkable that you are using for the defense precisely the same weapons which were once used for the attackgrimaux edouard lavoisier 1743–1794 paris 1888 2nd ed 1896 3rd ed 1899 page 53  blockquote
lavoisiers fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory he established the consistent use of the  used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids which later turned out to be erroneous lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with  they used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of  produced eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction
lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory believing that  which function as a single group in a chemical process combine with oxygen in reactions he also introduced the possibility of  when he discovered that diamond is a 
he was essentially a theorist and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure reinforced his own quantitative experiments expounding the true explanation of the results he completed the work of black priestley and cavendish and gave a correct explanation of their experiments
overall his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th centurycharles c gillespie foreword to lavoisier by jean pierre poirier university of pennsylvania press english edition 1996  lavoisiers work was recognized as an  by the   and the  in 1999

hermann kolbe adolph wilhelm hermann kolbe 27 sept 1818–25 nov 1884 was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern  as professor at  and  kolbe coined the term  and contributed to the philosophical demise of  through synthesis of the  acetic acid from  to  via modifications to the idea of radicals and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his  of carboxylate salts the  in the preparation of  and the  after studies with  and  kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in london with  and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the  to be elected to the royal swedish academy of sciences and to win the s davy medal in the year of his death despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists including      etc kolbe is remembered for editing the journal for more than a decade where his rejection of s structure of benzene s theory on the origin of  and s orms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent kolbe died of a heart attack in  at age 68 six years after the death of his wife charlotte he was survived by four children
kolbe was born in elliehausen near   germany as the eldest son of a  pastor at the age of 13 he entered the göttingen gymnasium residing at the home of one of the professors  he obtained the leaving certificate the  six years later  he had become passionate about the study of  matriculating at the  in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist 
in 1842 he became an assistant to  at the  he took his doctoral degree there in 1843  a new opportunity arose in 1845 when he became assistant to  at the new museum of economic geology in london where he became a close friend of   from 1847 he was engaged in editing the handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten chemie dictionary of pure and applied chemistry edited by   and  and he also wrote an important textbook  in 1851 kolbe succeeded bunsen as professor of chemistry at marburg and in 1865 he was called to the  in 1864 he was elected a foreign member of the 
in 1853 he married charlotte the daughter of general major wilhelm von bardeleben his wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage  they had four children
as late as the 1840s and despite  in 1828 some chemists still believed in the doctrine of  according to which a special life force was necessary to create organic ie in its original meaning biologically derived compounds kolbe promoted the idea that s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this organic context directly or indirectly by substitution processes hence while by modern definitions he was converting one  to another by the parlance of his era he was converting inorganic—anorganisch—substances into organic ones only thought accessible through vital processes he validated his theory by converting  to  in several steps 1843–45 kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural  so contributing to the development of  a dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules kolbe was the first person to use the word  in its present day meaning and contributed a number of new chemical reactions
in particular kolbe developed procedures for the  of the salts of  and other s   and prepared  a building block of  in a process called  or   his method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the  and with  he found that s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids
in addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work kolbe oversaw student research at leipzig and especially at marburg students spending time under his tutelage included   known for  predicting the product composition of elimination reactions  discoverer of  compounds s and the   discoverer of the   discoverer of      first to describe s smaller and larger than  and known for  describing addition reactions to alkenes    first to describe the double bond of ethylene  and 
kolbe served for more than a decade as what in modern terms would be understood the senior editor of the  journal of practical chemistry from 1870 to 1884 kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others especially after about 1874 that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness  he was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory
his rejection of structural chemistry especially the theories of the structure of benzene by  the theory of the  by  and the orm of chemical nomenclature by  was expressed in his vituperative articles in the journal für praktische chemie  some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists 
baeyer is an excellent experimentor but he is only an empiricist lacking sense and capability and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science 
the violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation  he died of a heart attack in

   keep this note technical term necessary for wikipedia articles dont assign for wiktionary   
in  an  allomorph is a variant form of a  that is when a unit of meaning varies in sound without changing meaning the term allomorph explains the comprehension of phonological variations for specific morphemes
english has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning examples include the past tense and the plural morphemes
for example in  a past tense morpheme is  ed  it occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a  when following an alveolar stop
as  or  in verbs whose  ends with the alveolar stops  or  such as hunted  or banded 
as  in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than  such as fished 
as  in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than  such as buzzed 
notice the other than restrictions above this is a common fact about allomorphy if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive in this case after an alveolar stop to least restrictive then the first matching case usually wins  thus the above conditions could be re written as follows
as  or   when the stem ends with the alveolar stops  or 
as  when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes
as  elsewhere
the fact that the  allomorph does not appear after stem final  despite the fact that the latter is voiceless is then explained by the fact that  appears in that environment together with the fact that the environments are ordered likewise the fact that the  allomorph does not appear after stem final  is because the earlier clause for the  allomorph takes priority and the fact that the  allomorph does not appear after stem final voiceless phonemes is because the preceding clause for the  takes priority
irregular past tense forms such as broke or was  were can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items such as the verb break which theore take priority over the general cases listed above
allomorphy can also exist in stems or  as in classical

there are three allomorphs of the stem   and   the allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case marking suffixes
the form of the stem  found in the nominative singular and locative plural is the etymological form of the morpheme pre indic palatalization of  resulted in the variant form  which was initially phonologically conditioned this conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form where the  is followed by the high front vowel 
but subsequent merging of  and  into  made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case both singular and plural as well as the nominative plural and instrumental singular hence this allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes
phonological conditioning also accounts for the  form found in the instrumental plural where the  assimilates in voicing to the following 
the term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure it was first applied to language in writing in 1948 by fatih Şat and sibel merve in language xxivoxford english dictionary online entry 50006103 accessed 2006 09 05

in  an allophone  from the  állos other and φωνή phōnē voice sound is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds or  or signs used to pronounce a single  in a particular language name 00qacid  for example  as in pin and  as in spin are allophones for the phoneme  in the  the specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context such allophones are called positional variants but sometimes allophones occur in  replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme will usually not change the meaning of a word although sometimes the result may sound non native or even unintelligible native speakers of a given language usually perceive one phoneme in that language as a single distinctive sound and are both unaware of and even shocked by the allophone variations used to pronounce single phonemes name 89rahec  name 06hozep 
the term allophone was coined by  in the 1940s in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early  theory  the term was popularized by g l trager and  in a 1941 paper on english phonology  and went on to become part of standard usage within the american structuralist tradition 
every time a speech sound is produced for a given phoneme it will be slightly different from other utterances even for the same speaker this has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are see  for details only some of the variation is significant ie detectable or perceivable to speakers there are two types of allophones based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has freedom to unconsciously choose which allophone to use
when a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context ie using a different allophone for a phoneme will cause confusion or make the speaker sound non native the allophones are said to be complementary ie the allophones complement each other and one is not used in a situation where the usage of another is standard in the case of complementary allophones each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a  process name 47qo 
in other cases the speaker is able to select freely from  allophones based on personal habit or perence
a  allophone is sometimes called an allotone for example in the neutral tone of 
 
there are many allophonic processes in english like lack of plosion nasal plosion partial devoicing of sonorants complete devoicing of sonorants partial devoicing of obstruents lengthening and shortening vowels and retraction
  – strong explosion of breath in english a voiceless plosive that is p t or k is aspirated whenever it stands as the only consonant at the beginning of the stressed syllable or of the first stressed or unstressed syllable in a word for example  as in pin and  as in spin are allophones for the phoneme  because they cannot distinguish words in fact they occur in  english speakers treat them as the same sound but they are different the first is aspirated and the second is  plain many languages treat these two phones differently see 
 nasal plosion – in english a plosive  has nasal plosion when it is followed by a nasal inside a word or across word boundary
 partial devoicing of  – in english sonorants  are partially devoiced when they follow a voiceless sound within the same syllable
 complete devoicing of sonorants – in english a sonorant is completely devoiced when it follows an aspirated plosive 
 partial devoicing of s – in english a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound inside a word or across its boundary
 retraction – in english  are retracted before 
because the choice of allophone is seldom under conscious control people may not realize they exist english speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme  namely unreleased  as in cat aspirated  as in top glottalized  as in button flapped  as in american english water nasalized flapped as in winter and none of the above  as in stop however they may become aware of the differences if for example they contrast the pronunciations of the following words
night rate unreleased  without  between  and 
nitrate  aspirated  or retracted 
if a flame is held before the lips while these words are spoken it flickers more during aspirated nitrate than during unaspirated night rate the difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips for a mandarin speaker to whom  and  are separate phonemes the english distinction is much more obvious than it is to the english speaker who has learned since childhood to ignore it
allophones of english  may be noticed if the light  of leaf  is contrasted with the dark  of feel  again this difference is much more obvious to a turkish speaker for whom  and  are separate phonemes than to an english speaker for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme
there are many examples for allophones in languages other than english typically languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation see eg  and   examples links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon

since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds not the sounds themselves they have no direct  when they are realized without much allophonic variation a simple  is used however when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme so that the allophony is significant things become more complicated often if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe in the sense of not requiring diacritics then that representation is chosen for the phoneme
however there may be several such allophones or the linguist may per greater precision than this allows in such cases a common convention is to use the elsewhere condition to decide which allophone will stand for the phoneme the elsewhere allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules for example english has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels the pattern is that vowels are nasal only when preceding a nasal consonant within the same syllable elsewhere theyre oral theore by the elsewhere convention the oral allophones are considered basic nasal vowels in english are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes
in other cases an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the worlds languages than the other allophones because it lects the historical origin of the phoneme or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory another alternative commonly employed for s is the use of a capital letter such as  n  for m n ŋ
in rare cases a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols such as s so as not to privilege any one allophone

when marking text for ing as in the third column in the chart above simple affixes such as pixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens affixes which disrupt the stem or which themselves are discontinuous are often marked off with angle brackets reduplication is often shown with a tilde affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash
lexical affixes or semantic affixes are bound elements that appear as affixes but function as s within verbs and as elements of s in other words they are similar to word roots stems in function but similar to affixes in form although similar to incorporated nouns lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns ie they always appear as affixes

as a  an allegory in its most general sense is an extended  allegory has been used widely throughout history in all forms of  largely because it can readily illustrate complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers readers or listeners
writers or speakers typically use allegories as s or as al devices that convey hidden meanings through ic figures actions imagery and or events which together create the moral spiritual or political meaning the author wishes to convey 
one of the best known examples of allegory s  forms a part of his larger work  in this allegory plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives facing a blank wall 514a b the people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows using language to identify their world 514c 515a according to the allegory the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows he tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves 516e 518a this allegory is on a basic level about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding seeks to share it as is his duty and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough

 discussed what he termed a continuum of allegory a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the naive allegory of  to the more private allegories of modern frye northrop anatomy of criticism princeton nj princeton up 1957 print  in this perspective the characters in a naive allegory are not fully three dimensional for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction the allegory has been selected first and the details merely flesh it out
many ancient religions are based on  that is allegories of the movement of the sun and the moon as seen from the earth
in classical literature two of the best known allegories are  in platos  book vii and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of menenius agrippa  ii 32 in late antiquity  organized all the information a fifth century upper class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of mercury and philologia with the seven  the young man needed to know as guestscapella martianus william harris stahl richard johnson and e l burge the marriage of philology and mercury new york columbia up 1977 print 
other early allegories are found in the  such as the extended metaphor in  of the  and its impressive spread and growth representing israels conquest and peopling of the promised land  also allegorical is  16 and 17 wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty eagle represents israels exile to rome 
allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story while infusing it with a spiritual context medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a reality underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses the allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances thus the papal bull  1302 presents themes of the unity of  with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic theore of this one and only church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster if then the greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of peter and his successors they necessarily confess that they are not of the sheep of christ this text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the medieval period following the tradition and example of the bible

since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognized this is allegoresis or the act of reading a story as an allegory for instance many people have suggested that  is an allegory for the  although tolkien has dismissed this other examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of  and even some works of science fiction and fantasy such as  by  and  by 
it is important to note that while allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way according to henry littlefields 1964 article s   may be readily understood as a plot driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters intended to discuss the politics of the timelittlefield henry 1964 the wizard of oz parable on populism american quarterly 16 1 47–58 doi102307 2710826  yet  emphasized in 1893 that a fairy tale is not an allegory in direct erence to  name baum2000  s  is another example of a well known work sometimes perceived as allegorical yet as the author himself once stated i cordially dislike allegory in all of its manifestations and i have always done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presence name bogstadkaveny2011   while this does not mean his works may not be treated as having allegorical themes especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings this further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention

allotropy or allotropism  is the property of some s to exist in two or more different forms in the same physical state known as allotropes of these elements allotropes are different structural modifications of an element  the  of the element are  together in a different manner for example the  include  where the carbon atoms are bonded together in a  lattice arrangement  where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a   single sheets of graphite and s where the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical tubular or ellipsoidal formations the term allotropy is used for elements only not for  the more general term used for any crystalline material is  allotropy ers only to different forms of an element within the same  ie different   or  forms these different states are not themselves considered to be examples of allotropy
for some elements allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases – for example two   osub2 sub and  osub3 sub can both exist in the solid liquid and gaseous states conversely some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases – for example  has  which all revert to the same psub4 sub form when melted to the liquid state
the concepts of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the swedish scientist baron  1779–1848 name jensen  the term is derived from the   allotropia variability changeableness  after the acceptance of  in 1860 it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules and the two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as osub2 sub and osub3 sub name jensen  in the early 20th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure
by 1912  noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of  known for compounds and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism name jensen  although many other chemists have repeated this advice  and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements onlyjensen 2006 citing addison w e the allotropy of the elements elsevier 1964 that many have repeated this advice 
allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours  the change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures ie   and   theore the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions for instance   changes from a  structure  to a  structure  above 906ampnbsp°c and  undergoes a modification known as  from a lic form to a  form below 132ampnbsp°c 558ampnbsp°f as an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour ozone osub3 sub is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen osub2 sub
typically elements capable of variable  and or  tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms  another contributing factor is the ability of an element to

agathocles  agathoklḗs 361 – 289 bc was a   of  317–289 bc and king of  304–289 bc
agathocles was born at thermae eae modern name  in sicily the son of a  who had moved to syracuse in about 343 bc he learned his fathers trade but afterwards entered the army along with his brother  in 333 bc he married the  of his patron damas a distinguished and wealthy citizen he was twice  for attempting to overthrow the  party in syracuse
in 317 bc he returned with an army of  under a solemn oath to observe the   which was established after they took the city having banished or murdered some 10000 citizens and thus made himself master of syracuse he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of sicily
war with  followed in 311 bc agathocles was defeated in the  and  in syracuse in 310 bc he made a desperate effort to break through the  and attack the enemy in  in africa he concluded the treaty with  ruler of  after several victories he was at last completely defeated 307 bc and fled secretly to sicily
after concluding peace with carthage in 306 bc agathocles styled himself king of sicily in 304 bc and established his rule over the  cities of the island more firmly than ever a peace treaty with carthage left him in control of sicily east of the  even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on carthage at the time of his death
his last years were plagued by ill health and the turbulence of his grandson  at whose instigation he is said to have been ed according to others he died a natural death he was a born leader of mercenaries and although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular tyrant agathocles restored the syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king
agathocles was married three times his first wife was the widow of his patron damas by whom he had two sons  and agathocles who were both murdered in 307 bc his second wife was alcia and they had a daughter called  who married as the second wife of king  his third wife was the   who was the second daughter of  from her first husband  and was a stepdaughter of  theoxena bore agathocles two children  and  theoxena survived agathocles he had further descendants from his second and third marriage
agathocles was cited as an example of those who by their crimes come to be princes” in chapter viii of ’s treatise on politics  1513 
he was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career 
however he came to glory as much as he did brutality by repelling invading carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land however many later disapproved of his actions including to an extent machiavelli who claimed 
machiavelli goes on to reason that agathocles success in contrast to other criminal tyrants was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that

 albertas economy is the sum of all  in    although alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture forestry education tourism finance and manufacturing the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of  since the 1940s  revenue from oil and natural gas extraction has fueled a series of economic booms in the provinces recent history and s have included petrochemical and pipelines
albertas per capita gdp in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in canada at 74825 approx us75000 in 2006 albertas per capita gdp was  and  albertas per capita gdp in 2007 was 61% higher than the canadian average of 46441 and more than twice that of all the  in 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in canadian history 
according to the  alberta has very high levels of  and rates alberta as the most free economy in canada  and second most free economy amongst us states and canadian provinces 
each fiscal quarter the office of alberta treasury board and finance submits a report which includes an updated alberta economic outlook and predictions for the following year 
on august 30 2015  minister of finance of alberta released the quarterly fiscal update which covers the period from april 1 to june 30 stating that the alberta budget could include a deficit of as much as 65 billion canadian – 11 billion more than his previous estimate – if the oil industry downturn persists at recent levels name deficit  name recession  rachel notley’s ndp party came into power on may 24 2015 name recession   name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08

alberta has a small internal market and it is relatively distant from major s despite good  and  alberta is located in the  of  in a region of low  called the  alberta is  and separated by  from the nearest  to the  and by the  from ports on  or  from these ports to major populations centres and markets in europe or asia is several thousands of kilometers the largest population clusters of north america the    and s are all thousands of kilometers away from alberta partly for this reason alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started  in other places notably the original  in great britain but which require large s and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets namely   or transportation related manufacturing   or 
 has the been a key industry since the 1870s the climate is dry  and  with extreme variations between seasons productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province excluding the mountains and in certain parts of the north agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in alberta than anywhere else in north america extending into the  above the  generally however  and areas along the  is forested land and  is more important than agriculture there agriculture is divided into primarily  in the east  in the west and a mixture in between and in the  in the near north
conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast oil sands are found in the northeast especially around  the 
because of its relatively economically isolated location alberta relies heavily on  with the rest of the world albertas historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new  see trends below alberta is now served by two major   and  by three major highway connections to the pacific the  via  the  via  and the  via  and one to the united states  as well as two international airports  and   also alberta is connected to the  natural gas to eastern canada the  gas  gas  and  oil to the eastern united states the  and  gas to the western united states and the  electric power to saskatchewan
since the days of early agricultural settlement the majority of albertas population has been concentrated in the  mixed forest grassland a boomerang shaped strip of land extending along the  from lloydminster to edmonton and then along the  south to calgary  this area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier  grassland region called  to its south and large areas of the south the “” were  during the  of the 1920s and 30s  the  black soil of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south  urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt  edmonton and red deer are parkland cities while calgary is on the parkland prairie fringe  lethbridge and medicine hat are prairie cities  grande prairie lies in the  a parkland region with isolated patches of prairie hence the name in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested    is the only urbanized population centre in the  which covers much of the northern half of the province
 
the calgary and edmonton regions by far the provinces two largest metropolitan regions account for the majority of the province’s population  they are relatively close to each other by the standards of western canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as vancouver or winnipeg  this has produced a history of political and economical rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities
the economic profile of the two regions is slightly different  both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands  however calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies  edmonton skews much more towards governments universities and hospitals as large employers while edmonton’s suburban fringes eg        are home to most of the province’s manufacturing much of it related to oil and gashttp  wwwedmontonjournalcom business lamphier+edmonton+roll+lucky 7691047 storyhtml 
seeing calgary and edmonton are part of a single economic region as the td study did in 2003 was novel the more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals for example in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the oil capital of canada
alberta has always been an  in line with   the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance in sequence the most important products have been fur wheat and beef and oil and gas
the development of  has been crucial to its historical economic development the  relied on   and  on  to move furs out of and european trade goods into the region immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the s  in 1880s commercial farming became viable in the area once the  had developed technologies to handle the  export of grain especially s and s oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing  technology
prior to the 1950s alberta was a primarily agricultural economy based on the export of   and a few other  the health of economy was closely bound up with the 
in 1947 a major  was discovered near edmonton it was not the first petroleum find in alberta but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province and coincided with growing american demand for energy since that time albertas economic fortunes have largely tracked the  and increasingly  when oil prices spiked during the   and  albertas economy boomed however during the  albertas economy suffered alberta boomed once again during the  in july 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and albertas economy soon followed suit with unemployment doubling within a year  by 2009 with natural gas prices at a long term low albertas economy was in poor health compared to before although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions  by 2012 despite natural gas prices at a ten year low and a higher canadian dollar oil prices had recovered enough to restart economic growth
the spin offs from petroleum have allowed alberta to develop many other industries oilpatch related manufacturing is an obvious example but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money
a comparison of the development of albertas less oil and gas endowed neighbours saskatchewan and manitoba reveals the role petroleum has played alberta was once the smallest of the three  by population in the early 20th century but by 2009 albertas population was 3632483 or approximately three times as much as either saskatchewan 1023810 or manitoba 1213815
albertas economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare government or retail primary industries are also of great importance however

 augustin louis cauchy    21 august 1789 – 23 may 1857 was a   reputed as a pioneer of  he was one of the first to state and prove theorems of  rigorously rejecting the heuristic principle of the  of earlier authors he almost singlehandedly founded  and the study of s in  a profound mathematician cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors his writings range widely in mathematics and 
more concepts and theorems have been named for cauchy than for any other mathematician in  alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for cauchy cauchy was a prolific writer he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks he was a devout  strict  royalist and a close associate of the 
cauchy was the son of  1760–1848 and marie madeleine desestre cauchy had two brothers alexandre laurent cauchy 1792–1857 who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849 and eugene françois cauchy 1802–1877 a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works
cauchy married aloise de bure in 1818  she was a close relative of the publisher who published most of cauchys works  by her he had two daughters marie françoise alicia 1819 and marie mathilde 1823
cauchys father  was a high official in the parisian police of the new régime he lost his position because of the  july 14 1789 that broke out one month before augustin louis was bornhis fathers dismissal is sometimes seen as the cause of the deep hatred of the french revolution that cauchy felt all through his life  the cauchy family survived the revolution and the following  1794 by escaping to arcueil where cauchy received his first education from his father after the execution of  1794 it was safe for the family to return to paris there louis françois cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job and quickly moved up the ranks when  came to power 1799 louis françois cauchy was further promoted and became secretary general of the senate working directly under  who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics the famous mathematician  was also a friend of the cauchy family
on lagranges advice augustin louis was enrolled in the  the best secondary school of paris at that time in the fall of 1802 most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages the young and ambitious cauchy being a brilliant student won many prizes in latin and humanities in spite of these successes augustin louis chose an engineering career and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the 
in 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam and he was admitted one of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high level scientific and mathematical education the school functioned under military discipline which caused the young and pious cauchy some problems in adapting nevertheless he finished the polytechnique in 1807 at the age of 18 and went on to the  school for bridges and roads he graduated in civil engineering with the highest honors
after finishing school in 1810 cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in cherbourg where napoleon intended to build a naval base here augustin louis stayed for three years and although he had an extremely busy managerial job he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts which he submitted to the première classe first class of the in the revolutionary years the french académie des sciences was known as the first class of the institut de france  cauchys first two manuscripts on  were accepted the third one on directrices of  was rejected
in september 1812 now 23 years old after becoming ill from overwork cauchy returned to paris another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics in paris he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position although he formally kept his engineering position he was transferred from the payroll of the ministry of the marine to the ministry of the interior the next three years augustin louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave and spent his time quite fruitfully working on mathematics on the related topics of  the  and the theory of higher order algebraic equations he attempted admission to the first class of the institut de france but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815 in 1815 napoleon was defeated at waterloo and the newly installed bourbon king  took the restoration in hand the  was re established in march 1816  and  were removed from this academy for political reasons and the king appointed cauchy to take the place of one of them the reaction by cauchys peers was harsh they considered his acceptance of membership of the academy an outrage and cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles
in november 1815  who was an associate professor at the École polytechnique asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star who certainly merited a professorship one of his great successes at that time was the proof of s  however the fact that cauchy was known to be very loyal to the bourbons doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of poinsot he finally quit his engineering job and received a one year contract for teaching mathematics to second year students of the École polytechnique in 1816 this bonapartist non religious school was reorganized and several liberal professors were fired the reactionary cauchy was promoted to full professor
when cauchy was 28 years old he was still living with his parents his father found it high time for his son to marry he found him a suitable bride aloïse de bure five years his junior the de bure family were printers and booksellers and published most of cauchys worksbradley amp sandifer page 9  aloïse and augustin were married on april 4 1818 with great roman catholic pomp and ceremony in the church of saint sulpice in 1819 the couples first daughter marie françoise alicia was born and in 1823 the second and last daughter marie mathilde
   cauchy had two brothers alexandre laurent cauchy who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849 and eugène françois cauchy a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works
the conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited cauchy perfectly in 1824 louis xviii died and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother  during these years cauchy was highly productive and published one important mathematical treatise after another he received cross appointments at the  and the 
in  charles x fled the country and was succeeded by the non bourbon king  of the  riots in which uniformed students of the École polytechnique took an active part raged close to cauchys home in paris
these events marked a turning point in cauchys life and a break in his mathematical productivity cauchy shaken by the fall of the government and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power left paris to go abroad leaving his family behind he spent a short time at  in switzerland where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime he used to do this and consequently lost all his positions in paris except his membership of the academy for which an oath was not required in 1831 cauchy went to the italian city of turin and after some time there he accepted an offer from the  who ruled turin and the surrounding piedmont region for a chair of theoretical physics which was created especially for him he taught in turin during 1832–1833 in 1831 he had been elected a foreign member of the 
in august 1833 cauchy left turin for  to become the science tutor of the thirteen year old duke of bordeaux  1820–1883 the exiled crown prince and grandson of charles x as a professor of the École polytechnique cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach and cramming his allotted time with too much material the young duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch although cauchy took his mission very seriously he did this with great clumsiness and with surprising lack of authority over the duke
during his civil engineering days cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the parisian sewers and he made the mistake of telling his pupil this with great malice the young duke went about saying that mister cauchy started his career in the sewers of paris his role as tutor lasted until the duke became eighteen years old in september 1838 cauchy did hardly any research during those five years while the duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics the only good that came out of this episode was cauchys promotion to  a title that cauchy set great store by in 1834 his wife and two daughters moved to prague and cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years of exile
cauchy returned to paris and his position at the academy of sciences late in 1838 he could not regain his teaching positions because he still used to swear an oath of allegiance however he desperately wanted to regain a formal position  in parisian science
in august 1839 a vacancy appeared in the  this bureau had some resemblance to the academy for instance it had the right to co opt its members further it was believed that members of the bureau could forget about the oath of allegiance although formally unlike the academicians they were obliged to take it the bureau des longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea – mainly the  coordinate since  is easily determined from the position of the sun since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations the bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences
in november 1839 cauchy was elected to the bureau and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with without his oath the king used to approve his election for four years cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected but not being approved hence he was not a formal member of the bureau did not receive payment could not participate in meetings and could not submit papers still cauchy used to take any oaths however he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to  in 1840 he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the academy he also described and illustrated the  of numbers an innovation presented in england in 1727 by  the confounded membership of the bureau lasted until the end of 1843 when cauchy was finally replaced by poinsot
throughout the nineteenth century the french educational system struggled over the separation of church and state after losing control of the public education system the catholic church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally he lent his prestige and knowledge to the  a school in paris run by jesuits for training teachers for their colleges he also took part in the founding of the  the purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of catholic university education in france these activities did not make cauchy popular with his colleagues who on the whole supported  ideals of the french revolution when a chair of mathematics became vacant at the  collège de france in 1843 cauchy applied for it but got just three out of 45 votes
the year 1848 was the year of revolution all over europe revolutions broke out in numerous countries beginning in france king louis philippe fearful of sharing the fate of louis xvi fled to england the oath of allegiance was abolished and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for cauchy on march 1 1849 he was reinstated at the faculté de sciences as a professor of mathematical astronomy after political turmoil all through 1848 france chose to become a republic under the presidency of  nephew of napoleon bonaparte and son of napoleons brother who had been installed as the first king of holland soon early 1852 the president made himself emperor of france and took the name 
not unexpectedly the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries including university professors not always does history repeat itself however because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the emperor to exempt cauchy from the oath cauchy remained a professor at the university until his death at the age of 67 he received the  and died at 4ampnbspam on may 23 1857
his name is one of the 
the genius of cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the —describing a  touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805 his generalization of  on  in 1811 and in several other elegant problems more important is his memoir on  propagation which obtained the grand prix of the french academy of sciences in 1816 cauchys writings covered notable topics including the theory of series where he developed the notion of  and discovered many of the basic formulas for  in the theory of numbers and complex quantities he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers he also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions the theory of functions differential equations and determinants
in the theory of light he worked on  wave theory and on the  and  of light    in  he developed the wave theory and his name is associated with the simple dispersion formula exactly which formula    he also contributed significant research in  substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter he wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media he introducedcauchy de la pression ou tension dans un corps solide on the pressure or tension in a solid body exercices de mathématiques vol 2 p 42 1827  a 3 × 3 symmetric  of numbers that is now known as the  in  he originated the theory of  and his results are nearly as valuable as those of 
other significant contributions include being the first to prove the 
cauchy is most famous for his single handed development of  the first pivotal theorem proved by cauchy now known as  was the following
math
 \oint_c fzdz   0
 math
where fz is a complex valued function  on and within the non self intersecting closed curve c contour lying in the  the contour integral is  taken along the contour c the rudiments of this theorem can  already be found in a paper that the 24 year old cauchy presented to the académie des sciences then still called first class of the institute on august 11 1814 in full formcauchy mémoire sur les intégrales définies prises entre des limites imaginaires memorandum on definite integrals taken between imaginary limits submitted to the académie des sciences on february 28 1825  the theorem was given in 1825 the 1825 paper is seen by many as cauchys most important contribution to mathematics
in 1826cauchy sur  un nouveau genre de calcul analogue au calcul infinitésimal on a new type of calculus analogous to the infinitesimal calculus exercices de mathématique vol 1 p 11 1826  cauchy gave a formal definition of a  of a function this concept regards functions that have s—isolated singularities ie points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity if the complex valued function fz can be expanded in the   of a singularity a as
math
fz   \phiz + \frac{b_1}{z a} + \frac{b_2}{z a^2} + \cdots + \frac{b_n}{z a^n}\quad
b_i za \in \mathbb{c}
 math
where φz is analytic ie well behaved without singularities then f is said to have  a pole of order n in the point a if n   1 the pole is called simple
the coefficient bsub1 sub is called by cauchy the residue of function f at a if f is non singular at a then the residue of f is zero at a clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to
math
\underset{z a}{\mathrm{res}} fz   \lim_{z \rightarrow a} z a fz
 math
where we replaced bsub1 sub by the modern notation of the residue
in 1831 while in turin cauchy submitted two papers to the academy of sciences of turin in the firstcauchy sur la mécanique céleste et sur un nouveau calcul qui sapplique à un grande nombre de questions diverses on the celestial mechanics and on a new calculus that can be applied to a great number of diverse questions presented to the academy of sciences of turin october 11 1831  he proposed the formula now known as 
math
fa   \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_c \frac{fz}{z a} dz
 math
where fz is analytic on c and within the region bounded by the contour c and the complex number a is somewhere in this region the contour integral is taken counter clockwise clearly the integrand has a simple pole at z   a in the second papercauchy mémoire sur les rapports qui existent entre le calcul des résidus et le calcul des limites et sur les avantages quoffrent ces deux calculs dans la résolution des équations algébriques ou transcendantes memorandum on the connections that exist between the residue calculus and the limit calculus and on the advantages that these two calculi offer in solving algebraic and transcendental equations presented to the academy of sciences of turin november 27 1831  he presented the 
math
 \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_c fz dz   \sum_{k 1}^n \underset{z a_k}{\mathrm{res}} fz

cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero  there has been a vast body of literature written about cauchys notion of infinitesimally small quantities arguing they lead from everything from the usual epsilontic definitions or to the notions of    the consensus is that cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used

archimedes of syracuse  name collins   ampnbspbcampnbsp– ampnbspbc was an      and    although few details of his life are known he is regarded as one of the leading s in  generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time   archimedes anticipated modern  and  by applying concepts of  and the  to derive and rigorously prove a range of  s including the  of a  the  and  of a  and the area under a  
other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of  defining and investigating the  bearing his name and creating a system using  for expressing very large numbers he was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena founding  and  including an explanation of the principle of the  he is credited with designing innovative s such as his   and defensive war machines to protect his native  from invasion
archimedes died during the  when he was killed by a  soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed  describes visiting the tomb of archimedes which was surmounted by a  and a  which archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb representing his mathematical discoveries
unlike his inventions the mathematical writings of archimedes were little known in antiquity mathematicians from  read and quoted him but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c 530ampnbspad by  in  constantinople while commentaries on the works of archimedes written by  in the sixth century ad opened them to wider readership for the first time the relatively few copies of archimedes written work that survived through the  were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the   while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by archimedes in the  has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results 
archimedes was born c 287ampnbspbc in the seaport city of  at that time a self governing  in  located along the coast of  the date of birth is based on a statement by the  historian  that archimedes lived for 75 years works of archimedes 1897  in  archimedes gives his fathers name as phidias an  about whom nothing is known  wrote in his  that archimedes was related to king  the ruler of syracuse  a biography of archimedes was written by his friend heracleides but this work has been lost leaving the details of his life obscure name mactutor  it is unknown for instance whether he ever married or had children during his youth archimedes may have studied in   where  and  were contemporaries he erred to conon of samos as his friend while two of his works  and the  have introductions addressed to eratosthenes
archimedes died c 212ampnbspbc during the  when roman forces under general  captured the city of syracuse after a two year long  according to the popular account given by  archimedes was contemplating a  when the city was captured a roman soldier commanded him to come and meet general marcellus but he declined saying that he had to finish working on the problem the soldier was enraged by this and killed archimedes with his sword plutarch also gives a  account of the death of archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a roman soldier according to this story archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items general marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of archimedes as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed name death  marcellus called archimedes a geometrical mary jaeger archimedes and the roman imagination p 113 
the last words attributed to archimedes are do not disturb my circles a erence to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the roman soldier this quote is often given in  as  but there is no reliable evidence that archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by plutarch  writing in memorable doings and sayings in the 1st century ad gives the phrase as sed protecto manibus puluere noli inquit obsecro istum disturbare    but protecting the dust with his hands said i beg of you do not disturb this the phrase is also given in  as μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε  name death 
the tomb of archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof consisting of a  and a  of the same height and diameter archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases in 75ampnbspbc 137 years after his death the roman   was serving as  in  he had heard stories about the tomb of archimedes but none of the locals was able to give him the location eventually he found the tomb near the agrigentine gate in syracuse in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription  a tomb discovered in the courtyard of the hotel panorama in syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of archimedes but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown 
the standard versions of the life of archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of ancient rome the account of the siege of syracuse given by  in his universal history was written around seventy years after archimedes death and was used subsequently as a source by plutarch and  it sheds little light on archimedes as a person and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city 
the most widely known  about archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape according to  a  for a temple had been made for king hiero ii who had supplied the pure  to be used and archimedes was asked to determine whether some  had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith  archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its 
while taking a bath he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in and realized that this effect could be used to determine the  of the crown for practical purposes water is incompressible  so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume by dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced the density of the crown could be obtained this density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added archimedes then took to the streets naked so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress crying  heúrēka meaning i have found it the test was conducted successfully proving that silver had indeed been mixed in 
the story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of archimedes moreover the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement name inaccuracy  archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in  as  which he describes in his treatise on floating bodies this principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a  equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces  using this principle it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold erence sample then immersing the apparatus in water the difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly  considered it probable that this method is the same that archimedes followed since besides being very accurate it is based on demonstrations found by archimedes himself name galileo  in a 12th century text titled mappae clavicula there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used and thus solve the problem name kingcrownhttp  wwwjstororg stable 27690606 o a w dilke gnomon 62 bd h 8 1990 pp 697 699 published by verlag chbeck marcel berthelot   sur l histoire de la balance hydrostatique et de quelques autres appareils et procédés scientifiques annales de chimie et de physique série 6 23   1891 pp 475 485  the latin poem carmen de ponderibus et mensuris of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown and attributes the method to archimedes name kingcrown  
a large part of archimedes work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of syracuse the greek writer  described how king hiero ii commissioned archimedes to design a huge ship the  which could be used for luxury travel carrying supplies and as a naval warship the syracusia is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity  according to athenaeus it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations a  and a temple dedicated to the goddess  among its facilities since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull the  was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water archimedes machine was a device with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder it was turned by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a  body of water into irrigation canals the archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain the archimedes screw described in roman times by  may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the     the worlds first seagoing  with a  was the  which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of archimedes and his work on the screw 
the  is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of syracuse also known as the ship shaker the claw consisted of a crane like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended when the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it there have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw and in 2005 a television documentary entitled superweapons of the ancient world built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device  
archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a  to burn ships attacking

this purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the renaissance  rejected it as false while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to archimedes  it has been suggested that a large array of highly polished  or  shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship this would have used the principle of the  in a manner similar to a 
a test of the archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the greek scientist ioannis sakkas the experiment took place at the  naval base outside  on this occasion 70 mirrors were used each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet 15 by 1ampnbspm the mirrors were pointed at a plywood  of a roman warship at a distance of around 160ampnbspfeet 50ampnbspm when the mirrors were focused accurately the ship burst into flames within a few seconds the plywood ship had a coating of  paint which may have aided combustion  a coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era
in october 2005 a group of students from the  carried out an experiment with 127 one foot 30ampnbspcm square mirror tiles focused on a  wooden ship at a range of around 100ampnbspfeet 30ampnbspm flames broke out on a patch of the ship but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes it was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions the mit group repeated the experiment for the television show  using a wooden fishing boat in  as the target again some charring occurred along with a small amount of flame in order to catch fire wood needs to reach its  which is around 300ampnbsp°c 570ampnbsp°f http  wwwengineeringtoolboxcom fuels ignition temperatures d_171html fuels and chemicalsampnbsp– auto ignition temperatures 
when mythbusters broadcast the result of the san francisco experiment in january 2006 the claim was placed in the category of busted or failed because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur it was also pointed out that since syracuse faces the sea towards the east the roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors mythbusters also pointed out that conventional weaponry such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances name death ray 
in december 2010 mythbusters again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled presidents challenge several experiments were carried out including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a  of a roman sailing ship 400ampnbspfeet 120ampnbspm away in all of the experiments the sail failed to reach the 210ampnbsp°c 410ampnbsp°f required to catch fire and the verdict was again busted the show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding  or distracting the crew of the ship name death ray2 
while archimedes did not invent the  he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work on the equilibrium of planes earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the  of the followers of  and are sometimes attributed to  name lever rorres  name lever clagett  according to  archimedes work on levers caused him to remark give me a place to stand on and i will move the earth quoted by  in synagoge book viii  plutarch describes how archimedes designed   systems allowing sailors to use the principle of age to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move  archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the  and with inventing the  during the  the odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled 
 106–43ampnbspbc mentions archimedes briefly in his   which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129ampnbspbc after the capture of syracuse c 212ampnbspbc general  is said to have taken back to rome two mechanisms constructed by archimedes and used as aids in astronomy which showed the motion of the sun moon and five planets cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by  and  the dialogue says that marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from syracuse and donated the other to the temple of virtue in rome marcellus mechanism was demonstrated according to cicero by  to  who described it thus
this is a description of a  or   stated that archimedes had written a manuscript now lost on the construction of these mechanisms entitled  modern research in this area has been focused on the  another device built ampnbspbc that was probably designed for the same purpose  constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of   this was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times but the discovery of the antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient greeks  
 
while he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics  wrote he placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no erence to the vulgar needs of life 
archimedes was able to use s in a way that is similar to modern  through proof by contradiction  he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy while specifying the limits within which the answer lay this technique is known as the  and he employed it to approximate the value of π in  he did this by drawing a larger  outside a  and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step as the number of sides increases it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle after four such steps when the polygons had 96 sides each he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3 approximately 31429 and 3 approximately 31408 consistent with its actual value of approximately 31416  he also proved that the  of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the  of the  of the circle πrsup2 sup in  archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude this is the  of real numbers 
in measurement of a circle archimedes gives the value of the  of 3 as lying between  approximately 17320261 and  approximately 17320512 the actual value is approximately 17320508 making this a very accurate estimate he introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it this aspect of the work of archimedes caused  to remark that he was as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his resultsquoted in heath t l works of archimedes dover publications isbn 0 486 42084 1  it is possible that he used an  procedure to calculate these values

in  archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain in doing so he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted he wrote there are some king gelo gelo ii son of  who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude and i mean by the sand not only that which exists about syracuse and the rest of sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited to solve the problem archimedes devised a system of counting based on the  the word is from the greek  murias for the number 10000 he proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads 100 million and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8  or 8

the first book is in fifteen propositions with seven  while the second book is in ten propositions in this work archimedes explains the  stating magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights
archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and  of various geometric figures including s s and s name works 
 
this is a short work consisting of three propositions it is written in the form of a correspondence with dositheus of pelusium who was a student of  in proposition ii archimedes gives an  of the value of pi  showing that it is greater than  and less than 
 
this work of 28 propositions is also addressed to dositheus the treatise defines what is now called the  it is the  of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant  equivalently in    it can be described by the equation

in this treatise addressed to dositheus archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud namely the relationship between a  and a d  of the same height and  the volume is sup3 sup for the sphere and 2sup3 sup for the cylinder the surface area is 4sup2 sup for the sphere and 6sup2 sup for the cylinder including its two bases where  is the radius of the sphere and cylinder the sphere has a volume  that of the circumscribed cylinder similarly the sphere has an area   that of the cylinder including the bases a sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of archimedes at his request
 
this is a work in 32 propositions addressed to dositheus in this treatise archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of  of  spheres and paraboloids
  two volumes
in the first part of this treatise archimedes spells out the law of  of fluids and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity this may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary greek astronomers such as  that the earth is round the fluids described by archimedes are not  since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape
in the second part he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids this was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships hulls some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water similar to the way that icebergs float  of buoyancy is given in the work stated as follows 
 
in this work of 24 propositions addressed to dositheus archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a  and a straight line is 4 3 multiplied by the area of a  with equal base and height he achieves this by calculating the value of a  that sums to infinity with the  
 
this is a  similar to a  and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the  archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a  research published by dr reviel netz of  in 2003 argued that archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square dr netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17152 ways  the number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and lection have been excluded  the puzzle represents an example of an early problem in 
the origin of the puzzles name is unclear and it has been suggested that it is taken from the  word for throat or gullet stomachos    ers to the puzzle as ostomachion a greek compound word formed from the roots of  osteon bone and  machēampnbsp– fight the puzzle is also known as the loculus of archimedes or archimedes box 
 
this work was discovered by  in a greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines in the herzog august library in  germany in 1773 it is addressed to eratosthenes and the mathematicians in alexandria archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the herd of the sun by solving a number of simultaneous s there is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be s this version of the problem was first solved by a amthorkrumbiegel b and amthor a das problema bovinum des archimedes historisch literarische abteilung der zeitschrift für mathematik und physik 25 1880 pp 121–136 153–171  in 1880 and the answer is a very large number approximately 7760271 
 
in this treatise archimedes counts the number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe this book mentions the  theory of the  proposed by  as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the earth and the distance between various celestial bodies by using a system of numbers based on powers of the  archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation the introductory letter states that archimedes father was an astronomer named phidias the sand reckoner or psammites is the only surviving work in which archimedes discusses his views on astronomy 
 
this treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the  in 1906 in this work archimedes uses  and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor so he also used the  to derive the results as with the cattle problem the method of mechanical theorems was written in the form of a letter to eratosthenes in

alternative medicine complementary medicine holistic medicine natural medicine unorthodox medicine fringe medicine unconventional medicine and  medicine may be used interchangeably as having the same meaning  in some contexts name bombardieri2000  name shuval2012  name freedman2011  but may have different meanings in other contexts for example unorthodox medicine may er to biomedicine that is different from what is commonly practiced and fringe medicine may er to biomedicine that is based on  which may be scientifically valid but is not mainstream
the meaning of the term alternative in the expression alternative medicine is not that it is an actual effective alternative to  although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness name atramm    stated that alternative medicine is a new name for snake oil theres medicine that works and medicine that doesnt work name kolata   loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not eg the use of the expressions western medicine and eastern medicine to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the asiatic east and the european west rather than that the difference is between  and treatments which dont work name atramm

the expression  or integrated medicine is used in two different ways one use ers to a belief that medicine based on science can be integrated with practices that are not another use ers only to a combination of alternative medical treatments with conventional treatments that have some scientific proof of efficacy in which case it is identical with cam name bmj_may  holistic medicine or holistic health is an alternative medicine practice which claim to treat the whole person and not just the illness itself
 and  er to prescientific practices of a culture not to what is traditionally practiced in cultures where medical science dominates  typically ers to prescientific traditional medicines of asia  when erring to modern practice typically ers to  and not to alternative medicines practiced in the west europe and the americas western medicine biomedicine          and  are sometimes used interchangeably as having the same meaning when contrasted with alternative medicine but these terms may have different meanings in some contexts eg some practices in medical science are not supported by rigorous scientific testing so medical science is not strictly identical with science based medicine and standard medical care may er to  when contrasted with other biomedicine that is less used or less recommended name ezzo2001 
prominent members of the science name  dawkins2003a  name  offit2013  and biomedical science community name angell1998  assert that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine that the expressions conventional medicine alternative medicine complementary medicine integrative medicine  and holistic medicine do not er to anything at all name angell1998  name  dawkins2003a  name  offit2013  name fontanarosa1998  their criticisms of trying to make such artificial definitions include theres no such thing as conventional or alternative or complementary or integrative or holistic medicine theres only medicine that works and medicine that doesnt name angell1998  name  dawkins2003a  name  offit2013  by definition alternative medicine has either not been proved to work or been proved not to work you know what they call alternative medicine thats been proved to work medicine name helmuth  there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work once a treatment has been tested rigorously it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset if it is found to be reasonably safe and effective it will be accepted name angell1998  and there is no alternative medicine there is only scientifically proven evidence based medicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine for which scientific evidence is lacking name fontanarosa1998 
others in both the biomedical and cam communities point out that cam cannot be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes and because the boundaries between cam and biomedicine overlap are porous and change the expression complementary and alternative medicine cam resists easy definition because the health systems and practices to which it ers are diffuse and its boundaries are poorly defined name  cam_sointu_nissen_eisenberg 
healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin theoretical basis   and in their relationship to the medical mainstream some alternative therapies including  and  have antique origins in east or south asia and are entirely alternative medical systemsbr    others such as homeopathy and chiropractic have origins in europe or the united states and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some such as  and chiropractic employ manipulative physical methods of treatment others such as  and  are based on s treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another name  nissen2013  thus chiropractic is not considered alternative in denmark and likewise  is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the united states name  nissen2013 
one common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as other than conventional medicine for example the widely erenced  descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the  of the  states that it is a group of diverse medical and health care systems practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine name nccih1  for conventional medical practitioners it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative
some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare name saks1992  this can er to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to  sympathetic coverage in the  or inclusion in the standard  name saks1992  in 1993 the  one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine stated that it erred to those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses name  bma_1993_1st  in a us context an influential definition coined in 1993 by the harvard based physician name  artus2007  david m eisenberg name  eisenberg_bio  characterized alternative medicine as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in us hospitalsbr    these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and cam introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training name  hol_kopelman_wieland_astin_pelletier  alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of  and increasingly  are willing to provide reimbursement for cam therapies in 1999 77% of us hospitals reported using some form of cam therapy this proportion had risen to 377% by 2008 name  salomonsen_aha 
an expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the us office for alternative medicine oam name  wieland2011  devised a  name  wieland2011  of alternative medicine as a broad domain of healing resourcesampnbsp other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period name  cam_rmc1997  this definition has been widely adopted by cam researchers name  wieland2011  cited by official government bodies such as the uk department of health name  ukdoh_cam  attributed as the definition used by the  name  zollchancoulrobeadamartu  and with some modification was perred in the 2005 consensus report of the  complementary and alternative medicine in the united states
the 1995 oam conference definition an expansion of eisenbergs 1993 formulation is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies name hufford2004  its proponents hold that it thus avoids  about differing forms of medical knowledge and while it is an essentially political definition this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream  is solely due to political forces name hufford2004   according to this definition alternative and  can only be differentiated with erence to what is intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture name kopelman2004  however there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and s nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity name kopelman2004  if the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population name kopelman2004 
 definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven unvalidated or ineffective and support of theories which have no recognized scientific basis these definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when used independently or in place of  they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine but which are not based on  gathered with the  name nccih1  name nsf_2002  name angell1998  name  nci_pdq_cam  name borkan2012  name kong2005  exemplifying this perspective a 1998 editorial co authored by  a former editor of the  argued that
 it is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work once a treatment has been tested rigorously it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset if it is found to be reasonably safe and effective it will be accepted but assertions speculation and testimonials do not substitute for evidence alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments name angell1998 
this line of division has been subject to criticism however as not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit  name ezzo2001  and it is also unlikely in most instances that conventional therapies if proven to be ineffective would ever be classified as cam name  wieland2011 
public information websites maintained by the governments of the us and of the uk make a distinction between alternative medicine and complementary medicine but mention that these two overlap the national center for complementary and integrative health nccih of the national institutes of health nih a part of the  states that alternative medicine ers to using a non mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine and that complementary medicine generally ers to using a non mainstream approach together with conventional medicine and comments that the boundaries between complementary and conventional medicine overlap and change with time name nccih1 
the  website nhs choices owned by the  adopting the terminology of nccih states that when a treatment is used alongside conventional treatments to help a patient cope with a health condition and not as an alternative to conventional treatment this use of treatments can be called complementary medicine but when a treatment is used instead of conventional medicine with the intention of treating or curing a health condition the use can be called alternative medicine name  nhs_choices_cam 
similarly the public information website maintained by the  nhmrc of the commonwealth of australia uses the acronym cam for a wide range of health care practices therapies procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine in the australian context this is stated to include acupuncture aromatherapy chiropractic homeopathy massage meditation and relaxation therapies naturopathy osteopathy lexology traditional chinese medicine and the use of vitamin supplements name  nhmrc_cam 
the  council for alternative medicine sundhedsstyrelsens råd for alternativ behandling srab an independent institution under the national board of health danish sundhedsstyrelsen uses the term alternative medicine for
 treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals

much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent complete medical systems these were developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods each system was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre scientific western medicine or with each others systems examples are  and the  of 
other alternative medicine practices such as  were developed in western europe and in opposition to western medicine at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of  which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water but homeopathy with its remedies made of water was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time which included use of s and  often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death name chbhama 
other alternative practices such as  and  were developed in the united states at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories but the biomedical model was not yet totally dominant practices such as chiropractic and osteopathic each considered to be irregular practices by the western medical establishment also opposed each other both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing and licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field without the original nonscientific practices and theories osteopathic medicine is now considered the same as biomedicine

dating from the 1970s medical professionals sociologists anthropologists and other commentators noted the increasing visibility of a wide variety of health practices that had neither derived directly from nor been verified by  name bivins2011  since that time those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field name bivins2011  a variety of terms have been used including heterodox irregular fringe and alternative medicine while others particularly medical commentators have been satisfied to label them as instances of quackery name bivins2011  the most persistent term has been alternative medicine but its use is problematic as it assumes a value laden dichotomy between a medical fringe implicitly of borderline acceptability at best and a privileged medical orthodoxy associated with validated medico scientific norms name jutte2001  the use of the category of alternative medicine has also been criticized as it cannot be studied as an independent entity but must be understood in terms of a regionally and temporally specific medical orthodoxy name  deblecourt1999  its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists name jutte1999  as with near synonymous expressions such as unorthodox complementary marginal or quackery these linguistic devices have served in the context of processes of professionalisation and market competition to establish the authority of official medicine and police the boundary between it and its unconventional rivals name jutte2001 
an early instance of the influence of this modern or western  scientific medicine outside europe and north america is  name  bullock1980 
from a historical perspective the emergence of alternative medicine if not the term itself is typically dated to the 19th century name  porter_ramsey_loudon  this is despite the fact that there are variants of western non conventional medicine that arose in the late eighteenth century or earlier and some non western medical traditions currently considered alternative in the west and elsewhere which boast extended historical pedigrees name jutte2001  alternative medical systems however can only be said to exist when there is an identifiable regularized and authoritative standard medical practice such as arose in the west during the nineteenth century to which they can function as an alternative
during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of europe and name  brunton_brown  as the nineteenth century progressed most western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semi protected medical markets name  pickstone2006  it is at this point that an official medicine created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of  emerges as a recognizable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable name  ramsey1999 
as part of this process professional adherents of mainstream medicine in countries such as germany france and britain increasingly invoked the scientific basis of their discipline as a means of engendering internal professional unity and of external differentiation in the face of sustained market competition from homeopaths naturopaths mesmerists and other nonconventional medical practitioners finally achieving a degree of imperfect dominance through alliance with the state and the passage of regulatory legislation name jutte2001  name jutte1999  in the us the  based in baltimore maryland opened in 1893with  and  among the founding physicians and was the first medical school devoted to teaching german scientific medicine name  silverman2011 
buttressed by the increased authority arising from significant advances in the medical sciences of the late 19th century onwards—including the development and application of the  by the chemist  and the surgeon  of  co founded by  in 1885 appointed professor of  at the  and of the use of s s—the 1910  called upon  to follow the model set by the johns hopkins school of medicine and adhere to mainstream science in their teaching and research this was in a belief mentioned in the reports introduction that the preliminary and professional training then prevailing in medical schools should be ormed in view of the new means for diagnosing and combating disease being made available to physicians and surgeons by the sciences on which medicine depended name  hiatt2003 
among putative medical practices available at the time which later became known as alternative medicine were homeopathy founded in germany in the early 19c and chiropractic founded in north america in the late 19c these conflicted in principle with the developments in medical science upon which the flexner orms were based and they have not become compatible with further advances of medical science such as listed in  1900–1999 and 2000–present nor have ayurveda acupuncture or other kinds of alternative medicine
at the same time  was being developed as a specialist branch of western medicine in research establishments such as  founded in 1898 by   founded in 1899 by  and  instituted in 1912 a distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems an example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in india including ayurveda submitted by  and others in 1923 this stated that the first question the committee considered was to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not name  usman1925  name  madras1984 
by the later twentieth century the term alternative medicine entered public discourse name  bma_cant_saks  but it was not always being used with the same meaning by all parties  remarked in 1998 that in the best kind of medical practice all proposed treatments must be tested objectively and that in the end there will only be treatments that pass and those that do not those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not he asked can there be any reasonable alternative name  relman1998  but also in 1998 the then   name  historymakers_hhs_satcher_bio  issued public information about eight common alternative treatments including acupuncture holistic and massage together with information about common diseases and conditions on nutrition diet and lifestyle changes and about helping consumers to decipher fraud and quackery and to find healthcare centers and doctors who practiced alternative medicine name  new_millennium

criticisms have come from individuals such as wallace sampson in an article in annals of the new york academy of sciences june 1995 name atramm   sampson argued that proponents of alternative medicine often used terminology which was loose or ambiguous to create the appearance that a choice between alternative effective treatments existed when it did not or that there was effectiveness or scientific validity when it did not exist or to suggest that a dichotomy existed when it did not or to suggest that consistency with science existed when it might not that the term alternative was to suggest that a patient had a choice between effective treatments when there was not that use of the word conventional or mainstream was to suggest that the difference between alternative medicine and science based medicine was the prevalence of use rather than lack of a scientific basis of alternative medicine as compared to conventional or mainstream science based medicine that use of the term complementary or integrative was to suggest that purported supernatural energies of alternative medicine could complement or be integrated into science based medicine integrative medicine or integrated medicine is used to er to the belief that medicine based on science would be improved by integration with alternative medical treatments practices that are not and is substantially similar in use to the term complementary and alternative medicine name bmj_may

complementary and alternative medicine cam has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems modalities and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period cam includes all such practices and ideas self defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well being boundaries within cam and between the cam domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed name  wieland2011

many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects which can be fatal 
one of the commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine cam is the manner in which is regulated there have been significant developments in how cams should be assessed prior to re sale in the united kingdom and the european union eu in the last 2 years despite this it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws name  colquhoun2012   there is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection from false claims toxicity and advertising with freedom to choose remedies
advocates of cam suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect name  connelly2012  some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over the counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose such as paracetamol name  malcolm2012 
 
forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine examples include immuno augmentation therapy shark cartilage bioresonance therapy oxygen and ozone therapies insulin potentiation therapy some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs radiation therapy or anesthetics during surgery among other problems name cassilethdeng2004  an anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by associate professor alastair maclennan of adelaide university australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking natural potions to build up her strength before the operation including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death name hills1999

and lastly  theres the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off and theyre disappointed and they move on to the next one and theyre disappointed and disillusioned and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult because you may not get compliance because theyve seen the failure so often in the past name  swanabc 
 
conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired  whereas alternative treatments in general are not subjected to such testing at all any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side effects attempts to ute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the  fallacy ie that which is natural cannot be harmful specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies  
an exception to the normal thinking regarding side effects is  since 1938 the  fda has regulated homeopathic products in several significantly different ways from other drugs name stehlin  homeopathic preparations termed remedies are extremely dilute often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active and possibly toxic ingredient is likely to remain they are thus considered safe on that count but their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs name stehlin 
 
those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious possibly life threatening illness name  navarro2006  for this reason critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous according to mental health journalist scott lilienfeld in 2002 unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments and ers to this as  individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful in short even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes name lilienfeld2002 
between 2001 and 2003 four children died in australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic homeopathic or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies name  hughes2010 
 
there have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in  these alternative cancer cures have often been described as unproven suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown however many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good quality clinical trials and they have been shown to be ineffectivethe label unproven is inappropriate for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven name vickers 
 has stated
  any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition there will never be an alternative cancer cure why because if something looked halfway promising then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it and if there is anything to it it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly all curative alternative cancer cures are based on false claims are bogus and i would say even criminal name miller 
funding for research into effectiveness of alternative treatments comes from a variety of public and private sources in the usa one conduit for funding and information is the national center for complementary and integrative medicine nccih other governments have various levels of funding the dutch government funded cam research between 1986 and 2003 but formally ended it in 2006 name  renkens2009 
physicians who practice complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available complementary therapies patients often express interest in mind body complementary therapies because they offer a non drug approach to treating some health conditions name  sobel2000  some mind body techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy were once considered complementary medicine but are now a part of conventional medicine in the united states name  webmd2011 
against alternative medicine it has been argued that in addition to the social cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth one of the most critical is the placebo effect which is a well established observation in medicine name  van_deventer2008   related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe name beyerstein   es that help maintain self esteem and promote harmonious social functioning name beyerstein   and the  fallacy name beyerstein  
cams popularity may be related to other factors which  mentioned in an interview in 
blockquotewhy is it so popular then ernst blames the providers customers and the doctors whose neglect he says has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped people are told lies there are 40 million websites and 399 million tell lies sometimes outrageous lies they mislead cancer patients who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives at the same time people are gullible it needs gullibility for the industry to succeed it doesnt make me popular with the public but its the truth name con  blockquote
in a paper published in october 2010 entitled the publics enthusiasm for complementary and alternative medicine amounts to a critique of mainstream medicine ernst described these views in greater detail and concluded
blockquotecam is popular an analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor providers of cam tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals in turn this implies that much of the popularity of cam is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare we should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients name  ernst2010  blockquote
a study published in 1998 indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments name astin1998  approximately 44 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine the research found that those having used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was not a meaningful factor in the choice but rather the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so largely because they find these healthcare alternatives to be more congruent with their own values beliefs and philosophical orientations toward health and life in particular subjects reported a holistic orientation to health a transformational experience that changed their worldview identification with a number of groups committed to environmentalism feminism psychology and or spirituality and personal growth or that they were suffering from a variety of common and minor ailments – notable ones being anxiety back problems and chronic pain
authors have speculated on the socio cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them in lieu of conventional medicine there are several socio cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of  among the public at large and a concomitant increase in  attitudes and   name beyerstein   related to this are vigorous  name  weber  of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics name beyerstein2001  name beyerstein 
there is also an increase in  toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies mistrust of traditional authority figures such as the physician and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments name beyerstein2001  many patients lack access to contemporary medicine due to a lack of private or public  which leads them to seek out lower cost alternative medicine name  barnes2004  medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market name weber 
patients can also be averse to the painful unpleasant and sometimes dangerous  of biomedical treatments treatments for severe diseases such as  and  infection have well known significant side effects even low risk medications such as  can have potential to cause life threatening  reactions in a very few individuals also many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach in all of these cases patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments name beyerstein2001  name beyerstein 
schofield and others in a systematic review published in 2011 make ten recommendations which they think may increase the effectiveness of consultations in a conventional here oncology setting such as ask questions about cam use at critical points in the illness trajectory respond to the persons emotional state and provide balanced evidence based advice they suggest that this approach may address  concerns surrounding cam use and encourage informed decision making about cam and ultimately improve outcomes for patients name  schofield2010

in  an archimedean solid is a highly symmetric semi regular  composed of two or more types of s meeting in identical  they are distinct from the s which are composed of only one type of polygon meeting in identical vertices and from the s whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices
identical vertices are usually taken to mean that for any two vertices there must be an  of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other sometimes it is instead only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other this difference in definitions controls whether the  pseudo rhombicuboctahedron is considered an archimedean solid or a  it is the unique convex polyhedron that has regular polygons meeting in the same way at each vertex but that does not have a global symmetry taking every vertex to every other vertex based on its existence  has suggested a terminological distinction in which an archimedean solid is defined as having the same vertex figure at each vertex including the elongated square gyrobicupola while a  is defined as having each vertex symmetric to each other vertex excluding the 
 and s whose s are the s are generally not considered to be archimedean solids despite meeting the above definition with this restriction there are only finitely many archimedean solids all but the elongated square gyrobicupola can be made via s from the platonic solids with   and 
the archimedean solids take their name from  who discussed them in a now lost work  ers to it stating that archimedes listed 13 polyhedra name g09  during the  s and s valued pure forms and rediscovered all of these forms this search was almost entirely completed around 1620 by field j rediscovering the archimedean polyhedra piero della francesca luca pacioli leonardo da vinci albrecht dürer daniele barbaro and johannes kepler archive for history of exact sciences 50 1997 227  who defined   and the non convex solids known as the 
kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola pseudorhombicuboctahedron at least he once stated that there were 14 archimedean solids however his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedrons existence was made in 1905 by  name g09 
there are 13 archimedean solids not counting the  15 if the s of two  see below are counted separately

some definitions of  include one more figure the  or pseudo rhombicuboctahedron pampnbsp85 
the number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex 
the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are  and are called 
the  of the archimedean solids are called the s  together with the s and  these are the  solids with regular vertices
the snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as  as they come in a left handed latin levomorph or laevomorph form and right handed latin dextromorph form when something comes in multiple forms which are each others three dimensional  these forms may be called enantiomorphs  this nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain s
the different archimedean and platonic solids can be related to each other using a handful of general constructions  starting with a platonic solid  involves cutting away of corners  to preserve symmetry the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners  depending on how much is truncated see table below different platonic and archimedean and other solids can be created  or  involves moving each face away from the center by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the platonic solid and taking the convex hull  expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces thus breaking the rectangles corresponding to edges into triangles  the last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges  ignoring scaling expansion can also be viewed as truncation of corners and edges but with a particular ratio between corner and edge truncation

note the duality between the cube and the octahedron and between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron  also in part due to self duality of the tetrahedron only one archimedean solid has only tetrahedral symmetry

in  an n sided antiprism is a  composed of two parallel copies of some particular n sided  connected by an alternating band of s antiprisms are a subclass of the s
antiprisms are similar to s except the bases are twisted relative to each other and that the side faces are triangles rather than quadrilaterals
in the case of a regular n sided base one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180° n extra regularity is obtained by the line connecting the base centers being perpendicular to the base planes making it a right antiprism as faces it has the two  bases and connecting those bases 2n isosceles triangles
a  antiprism has apart from the base faces 2n equilateral triangles as faces as a class the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex uniform polyhedra as do the uniform prisms for  we have as degenerate case the regular  as a digonal antiprism and for  the non degenerate regular  as a triangular antiprism

uniform star antiprisms are named by their  bases {p q} and exist in prograde and retrograde crossed solutions crossed forms have intersecting s and are denoted by inverted fractions p p q instead of p q like 5 3 versus 5 2
in the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry
some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths so are not uniform polyhedra star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where p and q have common factors thus a 10 4 antiprism is the compound of two 5 2 star antiprisms

the natural history of africa encompasses some of the well known  of that 
 is the study and description of organisms and natural objects especially their origins evolution and interrelationships
the vegetation of  follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture the northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally which is tropical in the countries bordering the  there are groves of  and  trees evergreen s  trees and s intermixed with    and fragrant 
south of the  range the conditions alter  the zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness  characteristic of the  is the  which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence while in the semidesert regions the  from which gum arabic is obtained is abundant
the more humid regions have a richer vegetation dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts and in the west african equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper  and  interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias etc forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation in the coast regions the typical tree is the  which flourishes wherever the soil is of a  character
the dense s of west africa contain in addition to a great variety of s two   oil palm and  bamboo palm not found generally speaking in the savanna regions  or silk cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests which are the home of the india rubber producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees such as  chlorophora excelsa   khaya senegalensis  oldfieldia africana and  baphia nitida the climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or bush is extremely dense
in the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or  adanisonia digitata  hyphaene and s the  plant grows wild in such widely separated places as  and southern  the higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern  the  and 
in the swamp regions of north east africa  and associated plants including the soft wooded  flourish in immense quantities and little else is found in the way of vegetation south africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions tropical flora disappears and in the semi desert plains the fleshy leafless contorted species of s s s and other succulent plants make their appearance there are too valuable timber trees such as the  podocarpus elongatus  ocotea  or  pteroxylon utile and ironwood extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent of the grasses of africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the atlas range
the fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation  the open savannas are the home of large s especially s the  peculiar to africa   wild  and four species of  and of carnivores such as the    etc the  a genus restricted to africa is found only in the dense forests of the  basin s are confined to the atlas region  and es to north africa the  though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters is found both in the savannas and forest regions the latter being otherwise poor in large game though the special habitat of the  and  s and s with few exceptions are peculiar to africa the single humped  as a domestic animal is

the main structural lines of the continent show both the east to west direction characteristic at least in the eastern hemisphere of the more northern parts of the world and the north to south direction seen in the southern peninsulas  is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles the northern running from east to west and the southern from north to south
the average elevation of the continent approximates closely to  above sea level roughly near to the mean elevation of both  and  but considerably less than that of   in contrast with other continents it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground lands under  occupying an unusually small part of the surface while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of asia or south america but the area of land over  is also quite insignificant being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges so prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term inselberg landschaft island mountain landscape has been adopted in  to describe this kind of country thought to be in great part the result of wind action
as a general rule the higher tablelands lie to the east and south while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable apart from the lowlands and the  range the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus the dividing line somewhat concave to the north west running from the middle of the  to about 6 deg s on the west coast
africa can be divided into a number of geographic zones
the coastal plainsampnbsp— often fringed seawards by mangrove swampsampnbsp— never stretching far from the coast apart from the lower courses of streams recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers elsewhere the coastal lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces that constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus
the ampnbsp— orthographically distinct from the rest of the continent being unconnected with and separated from the south by a depressed and desert area the 
the high southern and eastern plateaus rarely falling below  have a mean elevation of about  the  as far as about 12° s is bounded east west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts on this account south africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them the largest of these level areas the  is a dry barren region and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the 
the south african plateau is connected towards  with probably a slightly greater average elevation and marked by some distinct features it is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges tablelands and depressions the most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the earths crust the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley occupied by  the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system
farther north the western depression known as the  is occupied for more than half its length by water forming the  of    and  the first named over  long and the longest freshwater lake in the world associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks the greatest of which occur on a  east of the eastern trough the eastern branch of the  contains much smaller lakes many of them  and without outlet the only one comparable to those of the western trough being  or basso norok
at no great distance east of this rift valley is    with its two peaks kibo and mawenzi the latter being  and the culminating point of the whole continentampnbsp— and  which is  hardly less important is the  over  which lies east of the western trough other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys some of the kirunga mfumbiro group north of lake kivu being still partially active this could cause most of the citys and states to be flooded with lava and ash
the third division of the higher region of africa is formed by the  a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent little of its surface falling below  while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m this block of country lies just west of the line of the great east african trough the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the red sea there is however in the centre a circular basin occupied by 
both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast the ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the red sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of  in the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower the most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the  adamawa etc where heights of  are reached exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the cameroon on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south west has a height of  while clarence peak in  the first of the line of islands rises to over  towards the extreme west the futa jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers but beyond this as far as the atlas chain the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting
the area between the east and west coast highlands which north of 17° n is mainly desert is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground one of which runs nearly centrally through north africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole the best marked of the basins so formed the  basin occupies a circular area bisected by the equator once probably the site of an inland sea
running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the 
the arid region the ampnbsp— the largest desert in the world covering ampnbsp— extends from the  to the red sea though generally of slight elevation it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to  bordered nw by the atlas range to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the  this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the nile that river see below pierces the desert without modifying its character the  the north westerly part of the continent between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places  broad from the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the sahara the greater part of that now desert region is indeed furrowed by old water channels

from the outer margin of the african plateaus a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands before breaking through the outer ranges the main drainage of the continent is to the north and west or towards the basin of the 
to the main african rivers belong nile the longest river of africa congo river with the highest water discharge on the continent and the niger which flows half of its length through the arid areas the largest lakes are the following lake victoria lake ukerewe lake chad in the centre of the continent lake tanganika lying between the democratic republic of congo burundi tanzania and zambia there is also the considerably large lake malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world  malawi there are also numerous water dams throughout the continent kariba on the river of zambezi asuan in egypt on the river of nile and the biggest dam of the continent lying completely in the republic of ghana is called akosombo on the volta river fobil 2003
the high lake plateau of the  region contains the headwaters of both the nile and the 
the upper nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the central african trough in the neighbourhood of the equator from there streams pour eastward into  the largest lake in africa covering over 26000 square m and to the west and north into  and  to the latter of these the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters issuing from there the nile flows northward and between the latitudes of 7 and 10 degrees north it traverses a vast marshy level where its course is liable to being blocked by floating vegetation after receiving the bahr el ghazal from the west and the   and  from the  the chief gathering ground of the flood water it separates the great desert with its fertile watershed and enters the mediterranean at a vast delta
the most remote head stream of the congo is the  which flows southwest into the marshy  from this lake issues the congo known in its upper course by various names flowing first south it afterwards turns north through  and descends to the forest clad basin of west equatorial africa traversing this in a majestic northward curve and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the atlantic ocean through the western highlands
north of the congo basin and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface is the basin of  – a flat shored shallow lake filled principally by the  coming from the southeast
west of this is the basin of the  the third major river of africa with its principal source in the far west it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the nile and congo and ultimately flows into the atlanticampnbsp— a fact that eluded european geographers for many centuries an important branch howeverampnbsp— the —flows from the southeast
these four river basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of north and west africaampnbsp— the remainder consists of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea
of the remaining rivers of the atlantic basin the  in the extreme south brings the drainage from the  on the opposite side of the continent while the kunene kwanza ogowe and sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb the  komoe bandama  and  the highlands of the western limb north of the senegal for over  of coast the arid region reaches to the atlantic farther north are the streams with comparatively short courses reaching the atlantic and mediterranean from the atlas mountains
of the rivers flowing to the  the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the  whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands the main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ s 24°22′ e at an elevation of  it flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward all the largest tributaries including the shire the outflow of  flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10° to 12° s in the southwest the zambezi system interlaces with that of the  or tioghe from which it at times receives surplus water the rest of the water of the taukhe known in its middle course as the  is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in  now dried up
farther south the  drains a portion of the interior plateau but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source the   and  principally drain the outer slopes of the african great lakes highlands
in the  region to the north the  and the  rivers begin in the  these rivers mainly flow southwards with the jubba emptying in the  the shebelle river reaches a point to the southwest after that it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the jubba river another large stream the  rising in the ethiopian mountains is lost in a saline depression near the gulf of aden
between the basins of the atlantic and indian oceans there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the ethiopian plateau directed chiefly into the lakes in the  the largest river is the  which fed by the rains of the ethiopian highlands carries down a large body of water into  the rivers of africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths or by cataracts at no great distance upstream but when these obstacles have been overcome the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters
the area of the congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the amazon while the african inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but asia where the corresponding area is 4000000 square miles 10 mm²
the principal lakes of africa are situated in the african great lakes plateau as a rule the lakes found within the great rift valley have steep sides and are very deep this is the case with the two largest of the type tanganyika and nyasa the latter with depths of 430 s 790 m
others however are shallow and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season such are  in a subsidiary depression north of nyasa and eiassi and manyara in the system of the great rift valley lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth the deepest sounding in  being under 50 fathoms 90 m
besides the african great lakes the principal lakes on the continent are  in the northern inland watershed  and  traversed by the head stream of the congo and  and ntomba mantumba within the great bend of that river all except possibly mweru are more or less shallow and lake chad appears to be drying up
divergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the african great lakes especially  which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea dating from a time when the whole central congo basin was under water others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence the former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type they include jellyfish molluscs prawns crabs etc

lying almost entirely within the tropics and equally to north and south of the equator africa does not show excessive variations of temperature name  africa geography 
great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of north africa removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean and here too the contrast between day and night and between summer and winter is greatest the rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point
farther south the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface especially in east africa where the range of temperature is wider than in the congo basin or on the guinea coast
in the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone the south of the continent being narrower than the north the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt
the most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall the wide heated plains of the sahara and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the kalahari in the south have an exceedingly scanty rainfall the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation in the inter tropical zone of summer precipitation the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after it is theore greatest of all near the equator where the sun is twice vertical and less in the direction of both tropics
the rainfall zones are however somewhat deflected from a due west to east direction the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast and those of the south northwards along the west within the equatorial zone certain areas especially on the shores of the gulf of guinea and in the upper nile basin have an intensified rainfall but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world the rainiest district in all africa is a strip of coastland west of  where there is a mean annual rainfall of about  as compared with a mean of  at  in  
the two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone where the sun is vertical at half yearly intervals become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics where the sun is overhead but once snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges and on the highest the climate is thoroughly alpine
the countries bordering the sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind full of fine particles of sand blowing from the desert towards the sea known in  as the  on the mediterranean as the  it is called on the guinea coast the  this wind is not invariably hot its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result similar dry winds blow from the  in the south on the eastern coast the monsoons of the indian ocean are regularly felt and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced
the climate of africa lends itself to certain environmental diseases the most serious of which are   and  malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in africa it is transmitted by a genus of mosquito  native to africa and can be contracted over and over again there is not yet a vaccine for malaria which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in africa recently the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria
yellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to africa unlike malaria it cannot be contracted more than once like chicken pox it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease name  africa geography 
sleeping sickness or african trypanosomiasis is a disease that usually affects animals but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well it is transmitted by the  and is found almost exclusively in sub saharan africa  this disease has had a significant impact on african development not because of its deadly nature like malaria but because it has prevented africans from pursuing agriculture as the sleeping sickness would kill their livestock name  africa geography

approval voting is a  used for s each voter may approve of ie select any number of candidates the winner is the most approved candidate
guy ottewell first described the system in 1977  and also by  who coined the term approval voting it was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist  and mathematician   the idea of approval was adopted by x hu and  in 2003   in studying  in organizations
approval voting can be considered a form of  with the range restricted to two values 0 and 1—or a form of  with grades restricted to good and poor approval voting can also be compared to  without the rule that discards ballots that vote for more than one candidate
by treating each candidate as a separate question do you approve of this person for the job approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one some or all candidates all votes count equally and everyone gets the same number of votes one vote per candidate either for or against final tallies show how many voters support each candidate and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support
approval voting ballots show for each office being contested a list of the candidates running for that seat next to each name is a checkbox or another similar way to mark yes or no for that candidate this check yes or no approach means approval voting provides one of the simplest ballots for a voter to understand
ballots on which the voter marked every candidate the same whether yes or no have no effect on the outcome of the election each ballot can theore be viewed as a small  that separates two groups of candidates those supported and those that are not each candidate approved is considered perred to any candidate not approved while the voters perences among approved candidates is unspecified and likewise the voters perences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified
approval voting has been adopted by the  1986  the   the institute of management sciences 1987 now the http  wwwinformsorg downloadfilephpi a1d0c6e83f027327d8461063f4ac58a6 informs bylaws p 7  the  1987  and the  1987  according to steven j brams and peter c fishburn the ieee board in 2002 rescinded its decision to use approval voting ieee executive director daniel j senese stated that approval voting was abandoned because few of our members were using it and it was felt that it was no longer needed

approval voting is vulnerable to  and   while it is immune to  and 
 occurs when a voter approves only candidate a instead of both a and b for the reason that voting for b can cause a to lose
 occurs when a voter approves an additional candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning
strategic approval voting differs from ranked choice voting methods where voters might reverse the perence order of two options strategic approval voting with more than two options involves the voter changing their approval threshold the voter decides which options to give the same rating despite having a strict perence order between them
approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those  that directly lect the true perences of a voter ie that do not report perences falsely name sinceredefbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 29   they also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voters  as being any vote that if it votes for one candidate it also votes for any more perred candidate  this definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly perred candidates the same ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote the definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally perred candidates differently  when there are two or more candidates every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from  two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates  when there are three or more candidates every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates
 
based on the definition above if there are four candidates a b c and d and a voter has a strict perence order perring a to b to c to d then the following are the voters possible sincere approval votes
vote for a b c and d
vote for a b and c
vote for a and b
vote for a
vote for no candidates
if the voter instead equally pers b and c while a is still the most perred candidate and d is the least perred candidate then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote
vote for a and c
the decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary approval cutoff all candidates perred to the cutoff are approved all candidates less perred are not approved and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily
a sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use  is a way to make that choice in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting rather than being an alternative to it name probstrat  this differs from other voting systems that typically have a unique sincere vote for a voter
when there are three or more candidates the winner of an approval voting election can change depending on which sincere votes are used in some cases approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates including a  and a  without the voter perences changing  to the extent that electing a condorcet winner and not electing a condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere strategic voting   in one sense conditions where this can happen are robust and are not isolated cases   on the other hand the variety of possible outcomes has also been portrayed as a virtue of approval voting representing the flexibility and responsiveness of approval voting not just to voter ordinal perences but cardinal utilities as well name unmitigated 
 
approval voting avoids the issue of multiple sincere votes in special cases when voters have dichotomous perences  for a voter with dichotomous perences approval voting is  also known as strategy freebrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 31   when all voters have dichotomous perences and vote the sincere strategy proof vote approval voting is guaranteed to elect the condorcet winner if one existsbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 38   however having dichotomous perences when there are three or more candidates is not typical  it is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous perences when there are more than a few voters name probstrat 
having dichotomous perences means that a voter has bi level perences for the candidates  all of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top level group is perred to any candidate in the bottom level groupbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser pp 16 17   a voter that has strict perences between three candidates—pers a to b and b to c—does not have dichotomous perences
being strategy proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote regardless of how others vote in approval voting the strategy proof vote if it exists is a sincere vote name sinceredef 
 
another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal perence model with an approval or acceptance threshold  an approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of  a voter can approve of more than one candidate and still per one approved candidate to another approved candidate  acceptance thresholds are similar  with such a threshold a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold name probstrat 
with threshold voting it is still possible to not elect the  and instead elect the  when they both exist  however according to steven brams this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting  without providing specifics he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the  and other social choice criteria name critstrats 
voting strategy under approval is guided by two competing features of approval voting  on the one hand approval voting fails the  so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more perred candidate  on the other hand approval voting satisfies the  so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win but can cause that candidate to lose to a less perred candidate  either way the voter can risk getting a less perred election winner  a voter can balance the risk benefit trade offs by considering the voters cardinal utilities particularly via the  and the probabilities of how others vote
a  described by  and weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating   this strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voters  subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large
an optimal approval vote always votes for the most perred candidate and not for the least perred candidate  however an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more perred candidate if there 4 candidates or moresmith warren http  wwwmathtempleedu ~wds homepage newgibbsatpdf completion of gibbard satterthwaite impossibility theorem range voting and voter honesty actually there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates and definitely none for 3 candidates the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown 
other strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations  for example
 vote for the candidates that have above average utility  this strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likelybrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 85 
 vote for any candidate that is more perred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more perred than the expected runner up  this strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities
vote for the most perred candidate only  this strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating
another strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates the candidates that have an above median utility when the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly the strategy maximizes the voters power or efficacy meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate winsbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 74 81 
optimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the  and can elect a    strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the  in some special circumstances  for example if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small probability statistically independent errors in recording the votes then the winner will be the condorcet winner if one existslaslier j f 2006 http  halshsarchives ouvertesfr docs 00 12 17 51 pdf stratapproval4pdf strategic approval voting in a large electorate idep working papers no 405 marseille france institut deconomie publique

in the first scenario voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely  as a result they vote for any candidate with an above average utility  most voters vote for only their first choice  only the knoxville faction also votes for its second choice chattanooga  as a result the winner is memphis the condorcet loser with chattanooga coming in second place
in the second scenario all of the voters expect that memphis is the likely winner that chattanooga is the likely runner up and that the pivot probability for a memphis chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair wise ties  as a result each voter votes for any candidate they per more than the leading candidate and also vote for the leading candidate if they per that candidate more than the expected runner up each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies
in the second scenario there is a three way tie for first place  this happens because the expected winner memphis was the condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first
only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner up match the expected winner and runner up  as a result this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario in the language of  this is an equilibrium  in this scenario the winner is also the condorcet winner
as this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method modelling voters with a dichotomous cutoff assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff while having meaningful cardinal perences this means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates or all candidates above the average approval which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out resulting in a system that does not satisfy iia they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval cutoff that they have decided this cutoff does not change regardless of which and how many candidates are running so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff the voter votes for all or none of the candidates despite perring some over others  while this extreme appears unrealistic it actually lects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of in this way there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff and would not simply vote for their top 3 or the above average candidates although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable
for example   in this scenario voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate

most of the mathematical criteria by which voting systems are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal perences in this case approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff see examples above depending on how this decision is made approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria
there is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered but the following are criteria that  many voting theorists accept and considered desirable
 —a voter may have any perence ordering among the alternatives
 —there does not exist a single voter whose perence for the alternatives always determines the outcome regardless of other voters perences
 —if every voter pers candidate a to all other candidates then a must be elected from 
 —if there exists a majority that ranks or rates a single candidate higher than all other candidates does that candidate always win
 —is it impossible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher or to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking him lower
 —if the electorate is divided in two and a choice wins in both parts does it always win overall
 —is voting honestly always better than not voting at all this is grouped with the distinct but similar consistency criterion in the table belowconsistency implies participation but not vice versa for example score voting complies with participation and consistency but median ratings satisfies participation and fails consistency 
 —if a candidate beats every other candidate in  does that candidate always win this implies the majority criterion above
 —if a candidate loses to every other candidate in pairwise comparison does that candidate always lose
 —is the outcome the same after adding or removing non winning candidates
 —is the outcome the same if candidates identical to existing candidates are added
 —if individual perences of each voter are inverted does the original winner never win

 approval voting can allow voters to cast a compromise vote without abandoning their favorite candidate as long as voters accept the potential of that compromise vote resulting in the defeat of their favorite plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a lesser of evils to win
 approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections as ballots are cast so that final tallies are immediately available after the election without any upgrades to equipment approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level
 if voters are sincere approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme if backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and bullet vote for that first choice they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere perences
 if voters are sincere candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so however a candidate may win a  race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups
 approval voting fails the  because a candidate who is perred by a majority of voters is not always elected in some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate perred by a mere majority if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority in other cases with elections having three or more candidates approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also perred by a majority if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective ie vote only for the extreme candidate leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented
 suppose a candidate is eliminated say for medical reasons between a primary election and the party convention with plurality voting voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates
 approval voting without write ins is easily reversed as  where a choice is disavowed as is already required in other measures in politics eg representative 
 unlike plurality voting approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one increasing the probability an alternative wins
 in contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who per their favorite candidate vastly over all others approval voting may revert to  some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their perred candidate than as compromise choices  and  allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts
approval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections  a simple way to do so is as block approval voting a simple variant on  where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win  this does not provide  and is subject to the  among other problems
other ways of extending approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised among these are  and   for determining a proportional assembly and minimax approval  for determining a consensus assembly where the least satisfied voter is satisfied the most
approval ballots can be of at least four semi distinct forms the simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand write the names of the candidates they support a more structured ballot lists all candidates and voters mark each candidate they support a more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each candidate list ballots can include spaces for write in candidates as well
{  border
  
  
  
  
  
 }
all four ballots are theoretically equivalent the more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices the yes no format can help to detect an undervote when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct the single bubble format is incapable of producing invalid ballots which might otherwise be rejected in counting
unless the second or fourth format is used fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot that is it does not make it appear inconsistent thus approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the chain of custody of ballots is secure

alfred jarry  8 september 1873 – 1 november 1907 was a french  writer who is best known for his play  1896jarry alfred “ubu roi” dover 2003  he also coined the term and philosophical concept of https  wwwbookbytecom textbooks pataphysics 9780810118775 0810118777 pataphysics   01 edition 
jarry was born in  france and his mother was from brotchie alastair alfred jarry a pataphysical life mit press 2013 isbn 978 0 262 01619 3  he was associated with the  movement his play  1896 is often cited as a forerunner of  and to the  and  movements of the 1920s and 1930s jarry wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles piguring the  he wrote plays novels poetry essays and speculative journalism his texts present us with pioneering work in the fields of  and 
at the lycée in  when he was 15 he led a group of boys who enjoyed poking fun at their well meaning but obese and incompetent physics teacher a man named hébert jarry and his classmate henri morin wrote a play they called les polonais and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends the main character père heb was a blunderer with a huge belly three teeth one of stone one of iron and one of wood a single retractable ear and a misshapen body in jarrys later work ubu roi père heb would develop into ubu one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in french literature
at 17 jarry passed his  and moved to paris to prepare for admission to the École normale supérieure though he was not admitted he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose poems a collection of his work les minutes de sable mémorial was published in 1893
that same year both his parents died leaving him a small inheritance which he quickly spent
jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol which he called my sacred herb or when erring to  the green goddess a story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour and possibly under its influence
when he was drafted into the army in 1894 his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline the sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5 foot frame—the army did not issue uniforms small enough—was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons his military experience eventually inspired his novel days and nights
jarry returned to paris and applied himself to writing drinking and the company of friends who appreciated his witty sweet tempered and unpredictable conversation this period is marked by his intense involvement with  in the publication of  a luxuriously produced art magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints  as an art movement was in full swing at this time and lymagier provided a nexus for many of its key contributors jarrys play  1895 drew on this movement for material this is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which jarry would soon become associated using the biblical  as a point of departure caesar antichrist presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which christ is resurrected not as an agent of  but as an agent of the  that seeks to dominate spirituality it is a unique narrative that effectively links the domination of the soul to contemporaneous advances in the field of  such as the 1894 excavation of the  an ancient artifact used for situating the  within  the character ubu roi first appears in this playcody gabriele sprinchorn everet the columbia encyclopedia of modern drama volume 1 columbia university press 2007 isbn 9780231144223 page 53 
the spring of 1896 saw the publication in paul forts review le livre dart of jarrys 5 act play  — the rewritten and expanded les polonais of his school days ubu rois savage humor and monstrous absurdity unlike anything thus far performed in french theater seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage however impetuous theater director aurélien marie lugné poe took the risk producing the play at his théâtre de lŒuvre
on opening night 10 december 1896 with traditionalists and the  in the audience king ubu played by firmin gémier stepped forward and intoned the opening word merdre often translated as pshit or shittr in english a quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued outraged cries booing and whistling by the offended parties countered by cheers and applause by the more degenerate contingent such interruptions continued through the evening at the time only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held and the play was not revived until after jarrys death
the play brought fame to the 23 year old jarry and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created gémier had modeled his portrayal of ubu on jarrys own staccato nasal vocal delivery which emphasized each syllable even the silent ones from then on jarry would always speak in this style he adopted ubus ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech for example he erred to himself using the  and called the wind that which blows and the bicycle he rode everywhere that which rolls
jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition the diminutive jarry could just manage to stand up in the place but guests had to bend or crouch jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver in response to a neighbors complaint that his target shooting endangered her children he replied if that should ever happen ma da me we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you
with  and  he co founded the  which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of ubu roihttps  wwwschubertiademusiccom details multiple_catalogsyes descbonnard+pierre+1867+ +1947%3b+terrasse+claude+1867+ +1923%3b+jarry+alfred+1873+ +1907 pada schubertiade music online 
living in worsening poverty neglecting his health and drinking excessively jarry went on to write the novel le surmâle  which is partly a satire on the  ideal of self transcendence
unpublished until after his death his fiction  gestes et opinions du docteur faustroll pataphysicien describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who born at age 63 travels through a hallucinatory paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of  pataphysics deals with the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one in pataphysics every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event
jarry once wrote expressing some of the bizarre logic of pataphysics if you let a coin fall and it falls the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion
in his final years he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in paris   and  sought him out in his truncated apartment  was fascinated with jarry  after jarrys death picasso acquired his revolver and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in paris he later bought many of his manuscripts as well as executing a fine drawing of him
jarry died in paris on 1 november 1907 of  aggravated by drug and alcohol use it is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick he was interred in the  near paris

amalric   1136 – 11 july 1174 was  from 1163 and  before his accession he was the second son of  and  and succeeded his older brother  during his reign jerusalem became more closely allied with the  and the two states launched an unsuccessful  meanwhile the muslim territories surrounding jerusalem began to be united under  and later  he was the father of three future rulers of jerusalem   and 
older scholarship mistook the two names amalric and aimery as variant spellings of the same name so these historians erroneously added numbers making amalric to be amalric i 1163–74 and king  1197–1205 to be amalric ii now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries a history of cyprus vol 2 cambridge university press 2010 1947 p 45 n 1 
amalric was born in 1136 to king fulk the former  who had married the heiress of the kingdom melisende daughter of king  after the death of fulk in a hunting accident in 1143 the throne passed jointly to melisende and amalrics older brother  who was still only 13 years old melisende did not step down when baldwin came of age two years later and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other in 1152 baldwin had himself crowned sole king and civil war broke out with melisende retaining  while baldwin held territory further north amalric who had been given the  as an  when he reached the age of majority in 1151 remained loyal to melisende in jerusalem and when baldwin invaded the south amalric was besieged in the  with his mother melisende was defeated in this struggle and baldwin ruled alone thereafter in 1153 baldwin captured the ian fortress of  which was then added to amalrics fief of jaffa see 
amalric married  in 1157 agnes daughter of  had lived in jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader  were lost in 1150  objected to the marriage on grounds of  as the two shared a great great grandfather  and it seems that they waited until fulchers death to marry agnes bore amalric three children  the future  both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right and alix who died in childhood
baldwin iii died on 10 february 1163 and the kingdom passed to amalric although there was some opposition among the nobility to agnes they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when baldwin iii was still capable of siring an heir but now the  used to endorse amalric as king unless his marriage to agnes was annulled the hostility to agnes it must be admitted may be exaggerated by the chronicler  whom she prevented from becoming  decades later as well as from williams continuators like  who hints at a slight on her moral character car telle nest que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de jherusalem there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as jerusalem nevertheless consanguinity was enough for the opposition amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife although agnes continued to hold the title countess of jaffa and ascalon and received a pension from that fiefs income agnes soon thereafter married  to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with amalric the church ruled that amalric and agnes children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession through her children agnes would exert much influence in jerusalem for almost 20 years
during baldwin iiis reign the county of edessa the first  established during the  was conquered by  the turkic emir of  zengi united aleppo  and other cities of northern syria and intended to impose his control on  in the south the  in 1148 had failed to conquer damascus which soon fell to zengis son  jerusalem also lost influence to byzantium in northern syria when the empire imposed its suzerainty over the  jerusalem thus turned its attention to egypt where the  was suffering from a series of young s and civil wars the crusaders had wanted to conquer egypt since the days of  who died during an expedition there the capture of ascalon by baldwin iii made the conquest of egypt more feasible
amalric led his first expedition into egypt in 1163 claiming that the fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of baldwin iii the vizier dirgham had recently overthrown the vizier  and marched out to meet amalric at  but was defeated and forced to retreat to  the egyptians then opened up the  dams and let the river flood hoping to prevent amalric from invading any further amalric returned home but shawar fled to the court of nur ad din who sent his general  to settle the dispute in 1164 in response dirgham sought help from amalric but shirkuh and shawar arrived before amalric could intervene and dirgham was killed shawar however feared that shirkuh would seize power for himself and he too looked to amalric for assistance amalric returned to egypt in 1164 and besieged shirkuh in bilbeis until shirkuh retreated to damascus
amalric could not follow up on his success in egypt because nur ad din was active in syria having taken  and  prisoner at the  during amalrics absence amalric rushed to take up the regency of antioch and tripoli and secured bohemunds ransom in 1165 raymond remained in captivity until 1173 the year 1166 was relatively quiet but amalric sent envoys to the  seeking an alliance and a byzantine wife and throughout the year had to deal with raids by nur ad din who captured 
in 1167 nur ad din sent shirkuh back to egypt and amalric once again followed him establishing a camp near  shawar again allied with amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph  himself shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the  after an indecisive battle amalric retreated to cairo and shirkuh marched north to capture  amalric followed and besieged shirkuh there aided by a pisan fleet from jerusalem   shirkuh negotiated for peace and alexandria was handed over to amalric however amalric could not remain there indefinitely and returned to jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute
after his return to jerusalem in 1167 amalric married  a great grandniece of   the negotiations had taken two years mostly because amalric insisted that manuel return  to jerusalem once amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry maria in  on august 29 1167 during this time the queen dowager baldwin iiis widow  eloped with her cousin  to  and  which had been in her possession reverted into the royal domain of jerusalem it was also around this time that  was promoted to  of tyre and was recruited by amalric to write a history of the kingdom
in 1168 amalric and manuel negotiated an alliance against egypt and william of tyre was among the ambassadors sent to  to finalize the treaty although amalric still had a peace treaty with shawar shawar was accused of attempting to ally with nur ad din and amalric invaded the  eagerly supported this invasion while the  used to have any part in it in october without waiting for any byzantine assistance and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return amalric invaded and seized bilbeis the inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved amalric then marched to cairo where shawar offered amalric two million pieces of gold meanwhile nur ad din sent shirkuh back to egypt as well and upon his arrival amalric retreated
in january 1169 shirkuh had shawar assassinated shirkuh became vizier although he himself died in march and was succeeded by his nephew  amalric became alarmed and sent   to seek help from the kings and nobles of europe but no assistance was forthcoming later that year however a byzantine fleet arrived and in october amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged  by sea and by land the siege was long and famine broke out in the christian camp the byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure and a truce was signed with saladin amalric returned home
now jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies in 1170 saladin invaded jerusalem and took the city of  severing jerusalems connection with the red sea saladin who was set up as vizier of egypt was declared sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last fatimid caliph saladins rise to sultan was an unexpected reprieve for jerusalem as nur ad din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal nevertheless in 1171 amalric visited constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of europe for a second time but again no help was received over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by saladin and nur ad din but also by the  in one episode the knights templar murdered some hashshashin envoys leading to further disputes between amalric and the templars
nur ad din died in 1174 upon which amalric immediately besieged banias on the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from  which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in jerusalem william of tyre explains that after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days he ordered physicians of the greek syrian and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy neither they nor latin doctors could help and he died on july 11 1174
maria comnena had borne amalric two daughters  who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen was born in 1172 and a stillborn child some time later on his deathbed amalric bequeathed  to maria and isabella both of whom would retire there the  child  succeeded his father and brought his mother agnes of courtenay now married to her fourth husband back to court
william was a good friend of amalric and described him in great detail he had a slight impediment in his speech not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence he was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech like his brother baldwin iii he was more of an academic than a warrior who studied law and languages in his leisure time he was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact he was second to no one in this respect he was probably responsible for  making all rear vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the haute cour amalric had an enormous curiosity and william was reportedly astonished to find amalric questioning during an illness the  of the body he especially enjoyed reading and being read to spending long hours listening to william read early drafts of his history he did not enjoy games or spectacles although he liked to hunt he was trusting of his officials perhaps too trusting and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him although he used to take any action against those who insulted him publicly
he was tall and fairly handsome he had sparkling eyes of medium size his nose like that of his brother was becomingly aquiline his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead a comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin he had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook he did not overeat or drink to excess but his corpulence grew in his later years decreasing his interest in military operations according to william he was excessively fat with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist
amalric was pious and attended mass every day although he also is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women despite his piety he taxed the clergy which they naturally opposed
as william says he was a man of wisdom and discretion fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom he is considered the last of the early  after whom there was no king able to save jerusalem from its eventual collapse within a few years emperor manuel died as well and saladin remained the only strong leader in the east

during its heyday art deco represented luxury glamour exuberance and faith in social and technological progress
the first use of the term art deco is sometimes attributed to architect  who penned a series of articles in his journal lesprit nouveau under the headline 1925 expo arts déco he was erring to the 1925  international exposition of modern decorative and industrial arts name benton 2003 16 
the term came into more general use in 1966 when a french exhibition celebrating the 1925 event was held under the title les années 25 art déco bauhaus stijl esprit nouveau  here the term was used to distinguish the new styles of french decorative crafts that had emerged since the  name benton 2003 16  the term art deco has since been applied to a wide variety of works produced during the  lentre deux guerres and even to those of the  in germany however art deco originated in france it has been argued that the term should be applied to french works and those produced in countries directly influenced by france 
art deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian  published the first book on the subject  name hillier1   hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites the times 2 november 1966 and an essay named les arts déco in  magazine november 1967 as examples of prior usage  in 1971 hillier organised an exhibition at the  which he details in his book about it the world of art deco name hillier4

ascii art is a  technique that uses s for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable from a total of 128  defined by the  standard from 1963 and ascii compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters beyond the 128 characters of standard    leave it as 7 bit for accuracy    the term is also loosely used to er to  ascii art can be created with any  and is often used with s most examples of ascii  require a  non proportional  as on a traditional  such as  for presentation
among the oldest known examples of ascii art are the

one of the main reasons ascii art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks also to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users bulk printers often used ascii art to print large banners making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk ascii art was also used in early e mail when images could not be embedded  ascii art can also be used for typesetting 
since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art the oldest known preserved example of typewriter art is a picture of a butterfly made in 1898 by flora stacey   primary site http  wwwgeocitiescom soho 7373 historyhtm#typewrite

the widespread usage of ascii art can be traced to the computer s of the late 1970s and early 1980s the limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images along with asciis use in communication however it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period an ascii comic is a form of webcomic which uses ascii text to create images in place of images in a regular comic ascii art is used with the text or dialog usually placed underneath
during the 1990s graphical browsing and   became increasingly popular leading to a decline in ascii art  despite this ascii art continued to survive through online s an acronym for multi user dungeon which are textual  s    and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed 
ascii and more importantly  were staples of the early technological era terminal systems relied on coherent presentation using color and control signals standard in the terminal protocols

so called block ascii or high ascii uses the extended characters of the 8 bit  which is a proprietary standard introduced by  in 1979 ansi standard x316 for the ibm pc dos and ms dos operating systems block asciis were widely used on the pc during the 1990s until the internet replaced bbses as the main communication platform until then block asciis dominated the  name asciistyleshttp  wwwroysaccom roy sac_styles_of_underground_text_arthtml the three styles of the underground ascii art scene article 01 2006 roy  http  wwwroysaccom roysaccom  name ddarthistoryhttp  cdtextfilescom darkdomain www html history art_scenehtml an abbreviated history of the underground computer art scene by napalm 11 10 1998 the history of art and technology

there is some debate between ascii and block ascii artist with hardcore ascii artists maintaining that block ascii art is in fact not  because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ascii standard on the other hand block ascii artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set then it is to be called ascii regardless if the character set is proprietary or not  original sentence was entirely ungrammatical i hope this one gets the proper meaning across  
microsoft windows does not support the  x316 one can view block asciis with a text editor using the font  but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist with a special ascii ansi viewer such as acidview for windows see ascii and ansi art viewers one can see block ascii and ansi files properly an example that  in appearance is part of this article alternatively one could look at the file using the type command in the command prompt
 
in the art scene one popular ascii style that used the 7 bit standard ascii character set was the so called oldskool style it is also called amiga style due to its origin and widespread use on the  computers the style uses primarily the characters tt_ \ +  tt the oldskool art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures

the amiga ascii scene surfaced in 1992 seven years after the introduction of the commodore  the commodore 64 petscii scene did not make the transition to the commodore amiga as the c64 demo and warez scenes did among the first amiga ascii art groups were art epsilon design upper class unreal later known as dezign this means that the text art scene on the amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the pc the amiga artists also did not call their ascii art style oldskool that term was introduced on the pc when and by whom is unknown and lost in history
the amiga style ascii artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file which included all the artwork usually requested with some design parts in between as opposed to the pc art scene where the art work was released as a  with separate text files for each piece furthermore the releases were usually called ascii collections and not art packs like on the ibm pc

the east coast comprises three or four traditionally and linguistically distinct regions each of which possessing english varieties distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse  the  the  centering on philadelphia and baltimore and the  after the  the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the eastern us led to dialect mixing and leveling  so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the ern  the  and  is usually regarded as the southern western extent of new england speech which has its roots in the speech of the puritans from  who settled in the 
the  generally divides a group of northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the coastal southern dialect area in between these two rivers several local variations exist chief among them the one that prevails in and around  and northern  which developed on a dutch  after the english conquered new amsterdam the main features of coastal southern speech can be traced to the speech of the english from the  who settled in virginia after leaving england at the time of the 
a distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between  and the united states centered on the  region but only on the american side linguists call this region the  as defined by its unique —occurring in the same region whose standard midwestern speech was the basis for  in the mid 20th century though prior to this recent vowel shift those not from this area frequently confuse it with the north midland dialect treated below erring to both plus areas to the immediate west of the great lakes region all collectively as  a common but vaguely delineated term for what is now the central or north central united states the so called  dialect is also prevalent in the cultural  and is characterized by influences from the german and scandinavian settlers of the region like yah for yes pronounced similarly to ja in german norwegian and swedish in parts of  and  another dialect known as  is also spoken
between the traditional american north and south is what linguists have long called the midland this geographically overlaps with some states situated in the lower midwest west of the  begins the broad zone of modern day  speech this is divided into two discrete subdivisions the north midland that begins north of the  valley area and the south midland speech which to the american ear has some slight trace of a  sometimes the former region is designated simply midland and the latter is labelled as highland southern the north midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related western dialect which contains  as well as  although in the immediate  area some older speakers do not possess the  and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which lects a historical mid atlantic heritage
the south midland or highland southern dialect follows the  in a generally southwesterly direction moves across  and  west of the  and peters out in  it is a version of the midland speech that has assimilated some coastal southern forms outsiders often mistakenly believe south midland speech and coastal south speech to be the same
although no longer region specificcf trudgill p42   which remains prevalent among s has a close relationship to southern varieties of american english and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many americans
the island state of hawaii though primarily english speaking is also home to a  known commonly as 
dialect development in the united states has further been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as             etc which imposed their linguistic marks on the surrounding areas
compared with  north american english trudgill p 2 is a collective term used for the varieties of the english language that are spoken in both the united states and   is more homogeneous and any accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as  some distinctive accents can be found on the  for example in eastern  new york city philadelphia and baltimore partly because these areas were in close contact with  and imitated prestigious varieties of english at a time when these were undergoing changestrudgill pp 46–47  in addition many speech communities on the east coast have existed in their present locations for centuries while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing united states and developed a far more general linguistic pattern
studies on historical usage of english in the united states and the united kingdom suggest that spoken american english did not simply evolve from period british english but rather retained many archaic features contemporary  has since lost  most north american speech is  because in the 17th century when english was brought to the americas most english in england was rhotic rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of   and   in most varieties of north american english the sound corresponding to the letter r is a   or   rather than a trill or tap as often heard for example in the english accents of scotland or india a unique bunched tongue variant of the approximant r sound is also associated with the united states and seems particularly noticeable in the midwest and southa handbook of varieties of english bernd kortmann amp edgar w schneider walter de gruyter 2004 p 317  the loss of the r sound after a vowel for example causing spar to sound like spa known as non rhoticity is confined in the united states mostly to the accents of  the   and the  nowadays the vowel consonant cluster found in bird work hurt learn etc usually retains its r pronunciation even in otherwise non rhotic accents on the other hand dropping of syllable final r may sometimes happen in natively rhotic dialects if r is located in unaccented syllables wherein the next syllable or word begins in a consonant for example many north americans drop the first r in particular in england the lost r was often changed into   giving rise to a new class of falling s furthermore the er sound of fur or butter is realized in ame as a al  stressed  or unstressed  as represented in the  this does not happen in the non rhotic varieties of north american speech
some other english changes in which most north american dialects do not participate
 the realization of intervocalic  as a glottal stop  as in  for butter the only environment in which t glottalization is standard in american english is before syllabic  as in button 
on the other hand north american english has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of english speech
 the  making father and bother rhyme this change is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in north american english exceptions are in northeastern  such as the     and many  such as the  name wells    wells 1982 245–47   labov et al 2006 p 171 
 the merger of  and  in many areas this is the so called  where cot and caught are s this change has occurred in eastern new england boston area in  and surrounding areas and from the  westward
 for speakers who do not merge caught and cot the replacement of the cot vowel with the caught vowel in many cases before s as in cloth off which is found in some old fashioned varieties of rp as well as before  as in strong long usually in gone often in on and irregularly before  log hog dog fog which is not found in british english at all
 the from rum merger consisting of the replacement of the lot vowel with the strut vowel in most utterances of the words was of from what and in many utterances of the words everybody nobody somebody anybody the word because has either  or  this is directly due to influence of the according to merriam webster collegiate dictionary eleventh edition for speakers who merge caught and cot  is to be understood as the vowel they have in both caught and cot  want has normally  or  sometimes    
  before intervocalic  which vowels are affected varies between dialects but the   and  mergers are found in many american english dialects americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of ampmdashsuch as those in  and ampmdashsometimes monophthongizing towards  and  or  towards  and  respectively causing pronunciations like  for pair pear and  for peer pier  also  is often reduced to  so that cure pure and mature may all end with the sound  thus rhyming with blur and sir the word sure is also part of this rhyming set as commonly pronounced

  in environments that vary widely from accent to accent with most american speakers for whom the phoneme  operates under a somewhat continuous system  has both a tense and a lax  with a kind of continuum of possible sounds between those two extremes rather than a definitive split in these accents  is overall realized before s as more tense approximately  while other environments are more lax approximately the standard  for example note the vowel sound in  for mass  but  for man in some american accents though specifically those from   and   and  are entirely separate or split phonemes for example in planet  vs plan it  this is often called the mid atlantic  system note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed british broad a the phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern new england boston area who  to  the so called  before  alone or when preceded by a  nasal
  of intervocalic  and  to   before unstressed vowels as in butter  party  and syllabic  bottle  as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel what else  whatever  thus for most speakers pairs such as ladder latter metal medal and coating coding are pronounced the same except with the stressed  see below
  of  many speakers split the sound  based on its presence before either a voiceless or voiced consonant so that in writer it is pronounced  but in rider it is pronounced  this is a form of  but unlike more extreme forms of that process does not affect  in many areas and idiolects a phonemic distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant eg  for writer as opposed to  for rider

l velarization englands typical distinction between a clear l ie  and a dark l ie  or sometimes even  is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of american english it may even be altogether absent  instead most us speakers pronounce all l sounds with a tendency to be dark meaning with some degree of   the only notable exceptions to this are in some spanish influenced us english varieties such as  which typically shows a clear l in s and in older   of the us where l is clear in an  environment between sa handbook of varieties of english bernd kortmann amp edgar w schneider walter de gruyter 2004 p 319

the vowel  in unstressed syllables generally merges with   so roses is pronounced like rosas
some mergers found in most varieties of both american and british english include

 making pairs like wine whine wet whet wales whales wear where etc s in most cases eliminating  the  many older varieties of southern and western american english still keep these distinct but the merger appears to be spreading
north america has given the english  many thousands of words meanings and phrases several thousand are now used in english as spoken internationally
the process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora fauna and topography from the   examples of such names are    and  from   other native american loanwords such as  or  describe articles in common use among native americans the languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the american vocabulary for instance    and pit of a fruit from     from http  germanaboutcom library blvoc_gerloanhtm aboutcomampnbsp–   portage carrying of boats or goods and probably  from    and  from     
among the earliest and most notable regular english additions to the american vocabulary dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century are terms describing the features of the north american landscape for instance run branch fork    neck of the woods barrens  notch knob riffle s watergap cutoff   and  already existing words such as    and in later use  received new meanings that were unknown in england
other noteworthy american s are found among loanwords for example   french   via louisiana french  canadian french but used also in louisiana with a different meaning    spanish vlei skate  dutch 
the word  used in england to er to wheat or any cereal came to denote the plant  the most important crop in the us originally named  by the earliest settlers wheat rye barley oats etc came to be collectively erred to as  other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by  not only a building for hay and grain storage but also for housing livestock and team not just the horses but also the vehicle along with them as well as in various periods the terms      and 
 later applied to a  derives from  most spanish contributions came after the  with the opening of the west among these are other than toponyms  from chaparreras      examples of english additions from the  era are bad man maverick chuck food and  from the  came such idioms as hit pay dirt or strike it rich the word blizzard probably originated in the west a couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb belittle and the noun bid both first used in writing by 
with the new continent developed new forms of dwelling and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts land office  outlands waterfront the verbs locate and relocate betterment addition subdivision types of property   in the 18th century   tenement house   in the 19th century project     multi family in the 20th century and parts thereof  breezeway  dooryard   trim  stoop from dutch family room den and in recent years   walkout basement
ever since the  a great number of terms connected with the us political institutions have entered the language examples are run ie for office gubernatorial   after the  repeater  a  term used originally in banking  and  some of these are internationally used for example    
 
the development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words phrases and idioms typical examples are the vocabulary of ing see further at  and ation terminology ranging from names of roads from dirt roads and back roads to s and s to road infrastructure    and from automotive terminology to  for example in the sentence riding the subway downtown such american introductions as commuter from commutation ticket  to board a vehicle to park double park and parallel park a car  or the noun terminal have long been used in all dialects of englisha few of these are now chiefly found or have been more productive outside of the us for example jump to drive past a traffic signal block meaning building and center central point in a town or main area for a particular activity cf oxford english dictionary

already existing english words—such as   dry goods  —underwent shifts in meaning some—such as  student  the verbs can as in canned goods ship fix carry enroll as in school run as in run a business release and haul—were given new significations while others such as  have retained meanings that disappeared in england from the world of business and finance came       from sports terminology came jargon aside monday morning quarterback cheap shot game plan  in the  out of  off base hit and run and  from  gamblers coined    bottom dollar raw deal pass the buck ace in the hole freeze out showdown miners coined  bonanza peter out pan out and the verb prospect from the noun and railroadmen are to be credited with make the  sidetrack head on and the verb railroad a number of americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to north america    many automotive terms fall in this category although many do not        to exhaust
in addition to the above mentioned loans from french spanish mexican spanish dutch and native american languages other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration notably from   schmooze tush and — and culinary terms like frankfurter franks liverwurst sauerkraut       musical terminology   etc and apparently  fresh impudent and what gives such constructions as are you coming with and i like to dance for i like dancing may also be the result of german or yiddish influence 2004 new dialect formation the inevitability of colonial englishes

linguist  created a survey polling english speakers across the united states about the specific words they use for a variety of given definitionsvaux bert and scott golder 2003 the harvard dialect survey cambridge ma harvard university linguistics department  this 2003 study concludes that
for a long sandwich that contains s lettuce and so on the most common term throughout the country perred by 77% of the participants is the word sub ie  the  shows the greatest variety of terms for this idea in one single region largely counting for the 5% of the survey who per the term hero nearly 7% which is even more prevalent in the pittsburgh and philadelphia metropolitan areas including all of new jersey as well as eastern pennsylvania who per hoagie and just less that 3% also notably prevalent throughout new england except maine who per grinder 
the us is largely divided about the generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage nearly 53% of the surveyed sample say soda particularly in the northeast   the far  and some of  over 25% say pop particularly around the  including the  and the western regions along the canadian border over 12% say coke which is also trademarked for a  particularly scattered throughout the  urban coastal california speakers use all three terms though especially soda speakers of the  generally use soda or popkatz joshua 2013 http  www4ncsuedu ~jakatz2 files dialectposterpng beyond soda pop or coke north carolina state university 
the most common words to address a group of two or more people in the second  are the phrase you guys at almost 43% particularly throughout the northeast and great lakes region along with simply you at nearly 13% yall is perred by 14% particularly in the south but reaching somewhat into the northern regions as well youse is largely confined to the new york and philadelphia metropolitan areas at just over half of 1%
the most common term for generic rubber soled shoes worn for athletic activities is sneakers as said by 46% throughout the country but particularly in the northeast 41% particularly outside of the northeast say tennis shoes several much rarer other terms may also be used in various regions of the country
nearly 68% of american english speakers make no distinction between  and  or simply never use the term supper
64% of american speakers say where are you at to mean how are you coming along this also incorporates the 34% who use where are you at in any context for example to even mean where are you physically located right now
small  are known by 40% of polled speakers as crawfish 32% as crayfish and 19% as crawdads within no particular regional boundaries though crayfish seems fairly uncommon in the south
the most common nicknames for grandparents are grandpa grampa and grandma gramma
nearly all american english speakers call the  a fily or lightning bug with nearly 40% using the two terms interchangeably
american english and  bre often differ at the levels of phonology phonetics vocabulary and to a much lesser extent grammar and orthography
the first large american dictionary  was written by  in 1828 codifying several of these spellings
differences in grammar are relatively minor and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility these include different use of some  formal rather than notional agreement with s different perences for the past forms of a few verbs for example ame bre learned learnt burned burnt snuck sneaked dove dived although the purportedly british forms can occasionally be seen in american english writing as well different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts for example ame in school bre at school  when it means to be a student   and whether or not a definite article is used in very few cases ame to the hospital bre to hospital contrast however ame actress elizabeth taylor bre the actress elizabeth taylor often these differences are a matter of relative perences rather than absolute rules and most are not stable since the two varieties are constantly influencing each otheralgeo john 2006 british or american english cambridge cambridge university press isbn 0 521 37993 8  and american english is not a standardized set of dialects
differences in  are also minor the main differences are that american english usually uses spellings such as flavor for british flavour fiber for fibre defense for defence analyze for analyse catalog for catalogue and traveling for travelling noah webster popularized such spellings in america but he did not invent most of them rather he chose already existing options  on such grounds as simplicity analogy or etymologyalgeo john the effects of the revolution on language in a companion to the american revolution john wiley amp sons 2008 p599  other differences are due to the  tastes of 19th century  for example they perred programme for program manoeuvre for maneuver cheque for check etcpeters pam 2004 the cambridge guide to english usage cambridge cambridge university press isbn 0 521 62181 x pp 34 and 511  ame almost always uses  ize in words like realize bre pers  ise but also uses  ize see 
there are a few differences in punctuation rules british english is more tolerant of run on sentences called comma splices in american english and american english requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which british rules would place them outside american english also favors the double quotation mark over single name apa 
ame sometimes favors words that are  more complex whereas bre uses clipped forms such as ame transportation and bre transport or where the british form is a  such as ame burglarize and bre burgle from burglar however while individuals usually use one or the other both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems
british english also differ from american english in that some british words are pronounced with silent letters than are normally heard in ame such as the silent c in schedule

albert goodwill spalding september 2 1849 – september 9 1915 was an american   and executive in the early years of professional  and the co founder of  sporting goods company he played major league baseball between 1871 and 1878 a popular myth is that spalding became the first well known player to use a fielding glove in 1877 because such gloves were among the items sold at his sporting goods store field gloves were regularly used in the mid 1870s http  wwwnprorg templates story storyphpstoryid 1413207 
after his retirement as a player spalding remained active with the  as president and part owner in the 1880s he took players on the first world tour of baseball with  spalding organized the  he later called for the commission that investigated the origins of baseball and credited  with creating the game he also wrote the first set of official baseball rules
having played baseball throughout his youth spalding first played competitively with the  pioneers a youth team which he joined in 1865 after pitching his team to a 26–2 victory over a local mens amateur team the mercantiles he was approached at the age of 15 by another the forest citys for whom he played for two years name starr  in the autumn of 1867 he accepted a 40 per week contract nominally as a clerk but really to play professionally for the chicago excelsiors not an uncommon arrangement used to circumvent the rules of the time which forbade the hiring of professional players following the formation of baseballs first professional organization the  which became known as the national association the association or na in 1871 spalding joined the  precursor club to the modern  and was highly successful  206 games and losing only 53 as a pitcher and  323 as a hitter
 principal owner of the  did not like the loose organization of the national association and the gambling element that influenced it so he decided to create a new organization which he dubbed the  of baseball clubs to aid him in this venture hulbert enlisted the help of spalding playing to the pitchers desire to return to his midwestern roots and challenging spaldings integrity hulbert convinced spalding to sign a contract to play for the white stockings now known as the  in 1876 spalding then coaxed teammates   and  as well as  players  and  to sign with chicago this was all done under complete secrecy during the playing season because players were all free agents in those days and they did not want their current club and especially the fans to know they were leaving to play elsewhere the next year news of the signings by the boston and philadelphia players leaked to the press before the season ended and all of them faced verbal abuse and physical threats from the fans of those cities
he was the premier pitcher of the 1870s leading the league in victories for each of his six full seasons as a professional name   fame   during each of those years he was his teams only pitcher name pbs  in 1876 spalding won 47 games as the prime pitcher for the white stockings and led them to win the first ever national league  by a wide margin name   fame  
in 1877 spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand people had used gloves previously but never had a star like spalding used one spalding had an ulterior motive for doing so he now owned a sporting goods store which sold baseball gloves and wearing one himself was good advertising for his business
spalding retired from playing baseball in 1878 at the age of 27 although he continued as president and part owner of the white stockings and a major influence on the national league spaldings 796 career winning percentage from an era when teams played about once or twice a week is the highest ever achieved by a baseball pitcher
in the months after signing for chicago hulbert and spalding organized the national league by enlisting the four major teams in the east and the three other top teams in what was then considered to be the west joining chicago initially were the leading teams from   and  the owners of these western clubs accompanied hulbert and spalding to new york where they secretly met with owners from new york city   and  each signed the leagues constitution and the national league was officially born spalding was thus involved in the transformation of baseball from a game of gentlemen athletes into a business and a professional sport name   starr   although the national association held on for a few more seasons it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball gradually it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country
in 1905 after  wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the british sports of  and  spalding called for a  to find out the real source of baseball the commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters after three years of searching on december 30 1907 spalding received a letter that erroneously declared baseball to be the invention of  the commission though was biased as spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the english sport of rounders just before the commission in a letter to sportswriter  spalding noted our good old american game of baseball must have an american dad the project later called the mills commission concluded that base ball had its origins in the united states and the first scheme for playing baseball according to the best evidence available to date was devised by abner doubleday at  in 1839
receiving the archives of henry chadwick in 1908 spalding combined these records with his own memories and biases to write  published 1911 which despite its flaws was probably the first scholarly account of the  name   pbs  
in 1874 while spalding was playing and organizing the league spalding and his brother walter began a sporting goods store in chicago which grew rapidly 14 stores by 1901 and expanded into a manufacturer and distributor of all kinds of sporting equipment the company became synonymous with sporting goods name   starr   and is still a going concern
spalding published the first official rules guide for baseball in it he stated that only spalding balls could be used previously the quality of the balls used had been subpar spalding also founded the baseball guide which at the time was the most widely read baseball publication
in 1888–1889 spalding took a group of major league players around the world to promote baseball and  this was the first ever world baseball tour name   fame   playing across the western us the tour made stops in hawaii although no game was played new zealand australia  egypt italy france and england the tour returned to grand receptions in new york philadelphia and chicago the tour included future rs cap anson and  while the players were on the tour the national league instituted new rules regarding player pay that led to a revolt of players led by ward who started the  the following season 1890 the league lasted one year partially due to the anti competitive tactics of spalding to limit its success  the tour and formation of the players league is depicted in the 2015 movie deadballhttp  wwwimdbcom title tt4531902 _ fn_al_tt_2 
in 1900 spalding was appointed by  as the usas commissioner at that years  name   pbs  
spalding had been a prominent member of the theosophical society under   in 1900 spalding moved to  with his newly acquired second wife elizabeth name   starr   and became a prominent member and supporter of the  community  which was being developed on  by  he built an estate in the  area of point loma where he lived with elizabeth for the rest of his life the spaldings raised race horses and collected chinese fine furniture and art
the spaldings had an extensive library which included many volumes on theosophy art and literature in 1907–09 he was the driving force behind the development of a paved road known as the point loma boulevard from downtown san diego to point loma and  the road also provided good access to lomaland it later provided the basis for   he proposed the project supervised it on behalf of the city and paid a portion of the cost out of his own pocket he joined with  and other civic minded businessmen to purchase the site of the original  which they developed as a historic park and eventually donated to the city of san diego name marston  he ran unsuccessfully for the  in 1910 name   marston   he helped to organize the 1915  serving as second vice president

acquire is a  designed by  name hg  the game was originally published in 1962 by  as a part of their  in most versions the theme of the game is investing in  chains in the 1990s  edition the hotel chains were replaced by generic corporations though the actual gameplay was unchanged the game is currently published by hasbro under the  brand and the companies are once again hotel chains
the object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains when a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain at the end of the game all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money
the components of the game have varied over the years in particular the tiles have been made from wood plastic and cardboard in various editions of the game in the current 2008 version the tiles are cardboard the following components are included in all versions
 game board with 108 spaces arranged in a 12 by 9 array
 108 tiles corresponding to the squares in the array
 7 markers one for each of the hotel chains american continental festival imperial luxor or sackson in the 2008 version tower and worldwide
 25 shares of stock for each of the seven hotel chains
 a supply of play money in denominations of 100 500 1000 and 5000
 6 charts listing the prices of shares of the chains
the array on the game board is arranged with lettered rows a through i and numbered columns 1 through 12 the 108 tiles correspond to each of the squares 5e 10b and so forth
acquire is a game for three to six players though earlier editions included special rules for two players standard tournament games are played with four players
at the beginning of the game each player receives 6000 in cash each player draws a tile and places it on the board the player whose tile is in the topmost row closest to row a goes first if more than one player selects a tile in that row then the player whose tile is in the leftmost column closest to 1 goes first all players place these tiles on the board then starting with the first player each player draws six tiles
a turn consists of three steps
# placing a tile
# buying stock
# drawing a replacement tile
tile placement falls in one of four categories the tile placed could be an orphan adjacent to no other tile on the board the tile could create a new chain of tiles and the player who placed it on the board would have the opportunity to found a new chain the tile could increase the length of an existing chain already on the board or the tile could link two chains causing a merger of two or more chains since there are only seven hotel chains in the game placing a tile that would create an eighth chain is not permitted
when a player founds a chain he receives one free share of stock in that chain if however there are no shares left when the chain is founded then the founding player does not receive the free share
chains are deemed safe if they have 11 or more links placing a tile that would cause such a chain to be acquired by a larger chain is also not permitted
after a player places a tile and the results of that placement have been handled he may purchase up to three shares of stock a player may only purchase shares of stock in chains that have already been founded the price of a share depends on the size of the chain according to a chart that lists prices according to size a player may purchase shares in one two or three existing chains assuming at least three chains are currently in play in any combination up to a total of three shares
finally the player replaces the tile he played ensuring that he has six tiles at the end of his turn
a chain is a conglomeration of tiles that are linked to each other orthogonally but not diagonally for example adjacent to square 5f are squares 4f 6f 5e and 5g but not 6e or 4g if there is a tile in 5f then placing either tile 4f or 5g would result in founding a new hotel chain a chain grows when a player increases the length of a chain suppose a chain consists of squares 8d 8e and 8f playing tile 9f would add to the length of the chain playing tile 9c would not
chains merge when a player places the tile that eliminates the empty space between them suppose there is a chain at 1a 2a 3a and 4a along with another chain at 6a and 7a placing tile 5a would cause these two chains to merge when a merger occurs the larger hotel chain always acquires the smaller hotel chain that is the hotel chain with more tiles will continue to exist and now grows to include the smaller hotel chain after bonuses have been calculated according to the steps outlined below if a tile is placed between two hotel chains of the same size the individual player who places the tile decides which hotel chain remains on the board and which is acquired in this situation there are a number of strategic reasons why an individual player might select one hotel chain over another to be the one that remains on the board however often it is most advantageous for the player selecting to choose to let the more expensive chains remain on the board and trade in their stock of the less expensive chain at the 2 to 1 ratio described below
the merger is the mechanism by which the players compete mergers yield bonuses for the two shareholders who hold respectively the largest and second largest interests in a chain mergers also give each player who holds any interest at all in a chain a chance to sell his stock or to trade it in for shares of the acquiring chain a merger takes place in three steps
# bonuses for majority and minority shareholders each player counts his or her stock in the acquired chain the player with the largest number of shares is the majority shareholder and the player with the second largest number of shares is the minority shareholder if two players tie for majority they will share both shareholder bonuses if two players tie for minority they will share the minority shareholder bonusbrsuppose festival is the chain being acquired alex owns 10 shares betty owns 8 and carla owns 6 alex is the majority shareholder and betty is the minority shareholderbrsuppose now that worldwide is the chain being acquired alex owns 8 shares betty owns 8 shares and carla owns 7 alex and betty would share the majority and minority bonuses and carla would get no bonus if instead betty and carla both owned 7 shares then alex would keep the majority bonus for herself while betty and carla would split the minority bonus
# sell trade or hold shares starting with the player who caused the merger to happen each player may either sell his shares in the acquired chain trade in two shares of the acquired chain for one share of the acquiring chain or hold on to his shares of the acquired chain shares are sold at the same price as the current cost of one share of stock in the acquired chain a player may trade in as many shares as he owns but may not trade in one share of the acquired chain for half a share of the acquiring chain if a player holds onto his stock he runs the risk that the acquired chain may not reemerge before the game ends if that happens then he will be holding worthless stock at the end of the game
# defunct chain the acquired chain then becomes defunct it is eligible to be founded again if another player founds a chain again in a later turn
if placing a tile causes three or four chains to merge then the merger steps are handled between the largest and second largest chain then with the third largest chain and finally with the smallest chain
any player may declare the game over at any time during his turn if either of two conditions is true one chain has 41 or more tiles or there is at least one chain on the board and every chain on the board has 11 or more tiles upon declaring the game over the player is allowed to complete his turn including buying stock ending the game is optional   if he believes it is to his advantage not to end the game he may rain from doing so once the game ends the minority and majority bonuses are paid to the minority and majority holders in each of the remaining chains each player sells his or her shares of stock in each of the remaining chains and the player with the most money wins because ending the game is optional and a player may not realize that he can end it it is unethical to say good game or in any other way indicate that the game could be ended until after a player actually has ended the game
these conditions can be used to handle unusual situations
# replacing permanently unplayable tiles   per 1999 rules players can replace permanently unplayable tile tiles that would merge safe corporations at the end of their turn you may continue to replace unplayable tiles including new unplayable tiles that you draw until you have six playable tiles or the tile stock is empty

australian english ause aue auseng en aucodeen au code is the  for australian english as defined by s see  and  and s see   is a major variety of the  and is used throughout  although english has no official status in the  australian english is the countrys  official language and is the 
australian english began to diverge from  after the founding of the  in 1788 and was recognised as being different from british english by 1820 it arose from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of  dialectal regions of the  and quickly developed into a distinct variety of english name clasmqeduau 
australian english differs from other varieties of english in      and 
the earliest form of australian english was first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the colony of  this first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation the australian born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the british isles in particular from  and  name moore 2008 69 
the native born children of the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them and with it expressed  even when new settlers arrived this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech
a quarter of the convicts were irish many had been arrested in ireland and some in great britain many if not most of the irish convicts spoke either no english at all or spoke it poorly and rarely there were other significant populations of convicts from non english speaking part of britain such as the  and 
records from the early 19th century show the distinct dialect that had surfaced in the colonies since  in 1788 name clasmqeduau  with s 1827 book two years in new south wales describing the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native born colonists different from that of their parents and with a strong  influence name moore 2008 69   writes that australian english may be thought of as a kind of fossilised cockney of the dickensian era 
the first of the  in the 1850s began a large wave of  during which about two per cent of the population of the united kingdom emigrated to the colonies of  and   according to linguist bruce moore the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the australian accent was from south east england name moore 2008 69 
some elements of  have been —mainly as names for places flora and fauna for example  and local culture many such are localised and do not form part of general australian use while others such as kangaroo boomerang budgerigar wallaby and so on have become international other examples are  and hard yakka the former is used as a high pitched call for attracting attention pronounced  which travels long distances cooee is also a notional distance if hes within cooee well spot him hard yakka means hard work and is derived from yakka from the  yagara language once spoken in the brisbane region
also of aboriginal origin is the word bung from the sydney  english and ultimately from the sydney aboriginal language meaning dead with some extension to broken or useless many towns or suburbs of australia have also been influenced or named after aboriginal words the best known example is the capital canberra named after a local language word meaning meeting place 
among the changes starting in the 19th century was the introduction of words spellings terms and usages from  the words imported included some later considered to be typically australian such as bushwhacker and squatter 
  
this american influence continued with the popularity of american films and the influx of american military personnel in  seen in the enduring persistence of such terms as okay you guys and gee name bell 
the primary way in which australian english is distinctive from other varieties of english is through its unique pronunciation it shares most similarity with other  accents in particular trudgill peter and jean hannah 2002 international english a guide to the varieties of standard english 4th ed london arnold isbn 0 340 80834 9 p 4  like most dialects of english it is distinguished primarily by its vowel  
the vowels of australian english can be divided according to length the long vowels which include s and s mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of  rp as well as its centring diphthongs the short vowels consisting only of monophthongs correspond to the rp lax vowels  there exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving australian english  which is unusual amongst the various dialects of english though not unknown elsewhere such as in regional south eastern dialects of the uk and eastern seaboard dialects in the us  as with general american and new zealand english the  is complete in australian english unstressed  sometimes written as  or  is merged into   unless it is followed by a velar consonant

australian english is  in other words the  sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant however a  can occur when a word that has a final r in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel an  may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have r in the spelling in certain environments namely after the long vowel  and after word final 
there is some degree of allophonic variation in the s as with north american english  is a feature of australian english prevocalic  and  surface as the   after s other than   m as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group for many speakers  and  in the combinations   and   are also palatalised thus   and   as australian  is only very slightly retroflex the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth in the same position as for  it is also somewhat rounded to say r the way australians do you need to say w at the same time where older english  and  have fallen together as  the  is complete in australian english
 occurs after          and   other cases of  and  along with  and  have  to    and  respectively for many speakers   is generally retained in other s
in common with  and  the phoneme  is pronounced as a dark velarised l in all positions unlike other dialects such as  and  where a light l ie a non velarised l is used in many positions
differences in stress weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between australian english and other forms of english which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility
the affixes  ary  ery  ory  bury  berry and  mony seen in words such as necessary mulberry and matrimony can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa although some words like necessary are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel older generations of australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel
words ending in unstressed  ile derived from latin adjectives ending in  ilis are pronounced with a full vowel  so that fertile rhymes with fur tile rather than turtle
in addition miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of english in relation to seemingly random words for example as with american english the vowel in yoghurt is pronounced as  long o rather than  short o and vitamin is pronounced with  long i in the first syllable rather than  short i as with british english advertisement is pronounced with  and buoy is pronounced as  rather than  two examples of miscellaneous pronunciations which contrast with both standard american and british usages are data which is pronounced with  dah as opposed to  day and maroon pronounced with  own as opposed to  oon
academic research has shown that the most notable variation within australian english is largely  this is mostly evident in phonology which is divided into three sociocultural varieties broad general and cultivated 
a limited range of s is strongly regional in nature consequently the geographical background of individuals can be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular australian states or territories and in some cases even smaller regions
in addition some australians speak  derived from australian english such as   and 
the broad general and cultivated accents form a continuum that lects minute variations in the australian accent they can lect the  education and urban or rural background of speakers though such indicators are not always reliablehttp  wwwinternationalmqeduau globe defaultaspxid 244ampeditionid 162 australias unique and evolving sound edition 34 2007 23 august 2007 – the macquarie globe  according to linguists the general australian variant emerged some time before 1900bruce moore australian oxford dictionary and felicity cox macquarie university interviewed in sounds of aus television documentary 2007 director david swann writer lawrie zion princess pictures broadcaster abc television  recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the broad variant along with the near extinction of the cultivated australian accent   the growth and dominance of general australian accents perhaps lects its prominence on radio and television during the late 20th century
 is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of australia and are said to vary along a continuum from forms close to standard australian english to more non standard forms there are distinctive features of accent grammar words and meanings as well as language use
the ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in australian english that are spoken by the  groups which are of non english speaking background  a massive immigration from asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the australian context  these ethnocultural varieties contain features of general australian english as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non english language features such as the  and 
although australian english is relatively homogeneous some regional variations are notable the dialects of english spoken in       and the  differ slightly from each other differences exist both in terms of vocabulary and phonology
most regional differences come down to word usage for example swimming clothes are known as cossies or swimmers in new south wales togs in queensland and bathers in victoria western australia and south australia  what is erred to as a stroller in most of australia is called a pusher in victoria and usually a pram in western australia name pauline bryant 1985pauline bryant 1985 regional variation in the australian english lexicon australian journal of linguistics 51 55 66  perence for synonymous words also differs between states for example garbage ie garbage bin garbage truck dominates over rubbish in new south wales and queensland while rubbish is more popular in victoria western australia and south australia name pauline bryant 1985  the word footy generally ers to the most popular  in the particular state or territory that is  in new south wales and queensland and  elsewhere beer glasses are also  in different states distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative eh also spelled ay or aye which is particularly associated with queensland
there are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words the extent to which the  has taken hold is one example this phonological development is more advanced in south australia which had a different settlement chronology and type than other parts of the country which resulted in a prolonged british english influence that outlasted that of the other colonies words such as dance advance plant graph example and answer are pronounced far more frequently with the older  as in mad outside of south australia but with  as in father within south australia name pauline bryant 1985   is also more common in south australia than other states  in western australian and queensland english the vowels in near and square are typically realised as centring diphthongs nee ya whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs  a feature common in victorian english is  whereby a victorian pronunciation of ellen may sound like alan to speakers from other states there is also regional variation in  before  as in school and pool typically pronounced as  in queensland and new south wales but  in south australia and western australia
australian english has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect and have been written on extensively with the  widely regarded as the national standard incorporating numerous australian termsthe macquarie dictionary fourth edition the macquarie library pty ltd 2005 
internationally well known examples of australian terminology include  meaning a remote sparsely populated area  meaning either a native forest or a country area in general and gday a greeting dinkum or fair dinkum means true or is that true among other things depending on context and inflectionhttp  wwwanueduau andc pubs ozwords november_98 indexhtml frederick ludowyk 1998 aussie words the dinkum oil on dinkum where does it come from 0zwords australian national dictionary centre access date 5 november 2007   the derivative dinky di means true or devoted a dinky di aussie is a true australian
 such as  as well as  such as  contain many historical australian words and phrases that are understood by australians even though some are not in common usage today
australian english in common with several british english dialects for example    and  uses the word  many words used by australians were at one time used in england but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there
for example creek in australia as in north america means a stream or small river whereas in the uk it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea paddock in australia means field whereas in the uk it means a small enclosure for livestock bush or scrub in australia as in north america means a wooded area whereas in england they are commonly used only in proper names such as  and 
 such as not bad not much and youre not wrong are also used as are s which are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity some common examples are arvo afternoon barbie barbecue  cigarette break aussie australian and pressie present gift this may also be done with peoples names to create s other english speaking countries create  for example gazza from gary or smitty from john smith the use of the suffix  o originates in irish gaelic irish ó which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in australian english
in informal speech incomplete comparisons are sometimes used such as sweet as as in that car is sweet as full fully or heaps may precede a word to act as an intensifier as in the waves at the beach were heaps good this was more common in regional australia and south australia but has been in common usage in urban australia for decades the suffix  ly is sometimes omitted in broader australian english for instance really good can become real good
australias switch to the  in the 1970s changed the countrys vocabulary of measurement from imperial towards metric measures 
where  australians sometimes favour a usage different from both varieties as with footpath for us sidewalk uk pavement capsicum for us bell pepper uk green red pepper or  for us comforter uk duvet in other instances it either shares a term with american english as with  uk lorry or  uk aubergine or with british english as with  us cell phone or  us hood
a non exhaustive selection of common british english terms not commonly used in australian english include australian usage in brackets artic articulated lorry semi trailer aubergine eggplant bank holiday public holiday bedsit one bedroom apartment bin lorry garbage rubbish truck cagoule raincoat candy floss fairy floss cash machine automatic teller machine atm child minder babysitter clingfilm glad wrap cling wrap courgette zucchini crisps chips potato chips doddle bludge dungarees overalls dustbin garbage rubbish bin dustcart garbage rubbish truck duvet doona elastoplast plaster band aid estate car station wagon fairy cake cupcake patty cake flannel face washer wash cloth free phone toll free football soccer high street main street hoover vacuum cleaner ice lolly ice block icy pole kitchen roll paper towel lavatory toilet lorry truck off licence bottle shop pavement footpath red green pepper capsicum pillar box mail box plimsoll sandshoe pushchair pram stroller saloon sedan sweets lollies utility room laundry wellington boots gumboots
a non exhaustive list of american english terms not commonly found in australian english include acclimate acclimatise aluminum aluminium bangs fringe bell pepper capsicum bellhop hotel porter broil grill burglarize burgle busboy included under the broader term of waiter candy lollies cell phone mobile phone cilantro coriander comforter doona cookie biscuit counter clockwise anticlockwise diaper nappy drywall plasterboard emergency brake handbrake faucet tap flashlight torch gasoline petrol hood bonnet jell o jelly jelly jam math maths pacifier dummy parking lot car park popsicle ice block icy pole railway ties sleepers rear view mirror rear vision mirror row house terrace house scallion spring onion stickshift manual transmission streetcar tram takeout takeaway trash can garbage rubbish bin trunk boot turn signal indicator blinker vacation holiday windshield windscreen
terms shared by british and american english but not so commonly found in australian english include abroad overseas  ice box esky  ute  bushfire
australian english is particularly divergent from other varieties with respect to geographical terminology due to the countrys unique geography this is particularly true when comparing with british english due to that countrys dramatically different geography british geographical terms not in common use in australia include coppice cleared bushland dell valley fen swamp heath shrubland meadow grassy plain moor swampland spinney shrubland stream creek woods bush and village even the smallest settlements in australia are called towns or stations
in addition a number of words in australian english have different meanings to those ascribed in other varieties of english clothing related examples are notable pants in australian english er to british english trousers but in british english er to australian english underpants vest in australian english ers to british english waistcoat but in british english ers to australian english singlet thong in both american and british english ers to underwear otherwise known as a  while in australian english it ers to british and american english flip flop footwear there are numerous other examples including biscuit which ers in australian and british english to american english cookie or cracker but to a savoury cake in american english another notable example that has emerged due to immigration patterns is the use of the noun asian which in australian and american english commonly ers to people of n heritage british english oriental as opposed to british english in which it commonly ers to people of n descent
as with american english but unlike british english collective nouns are almost always singular in construction eg the government was unable to decide as opposed to the government were unable to decide
in common with british english the past tense and past participles of the verbs learn spell and smell are often irregular learnt spelt smelt
shant and the use of should as in i should be happy if common in upper register british english are almost never encountered in australian or north american english
while prepositions before days may be omitted in american english ie she resigned thursday they must be retained in australian english as in british english she resigned on thursday ranges of dates use to ie monday to friday as with british english rather than monday through friday in american english
river generally follows the name of the river in question as in north america ie darling river rather than the british convention of coming before the name eg river thames note in south australia however the british convention applies—for example the river murray or the river torrens
when saying or writing out numbers and is inserted before the tens and units ie one hundred and sixty two as with british practice however australians like americans are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1200 as twelve hundred rather than one thousand two hundred
as with american english on the weekend and studied medicine are used rather than the british at the weekend and read medicine

as in most english speaking countries there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar the  is used by some  and some other organisations as a standard for australian english spelling the style manual for authors editors and printers the cambridge guide to australian english usage and the australian guide to legal citation are prominent style guides
australian spelling is closer to  than  as with british spelling the u is retained in words such as colour honour labour and favour  while the macquarie dictionary lists the  our ending and follows it with the  or ending as an acceptable variant the latter is rarely found in actual use today australian print media including digital media today strongly favour  our endings a notable exception to this rule is the  which adopted the american spelling in 1912 as a result of  or spellings comparative popularity at that time consistent with british spellings  re rather than  er is the only listed variant in australian dictionaries in words such as theatre centre and manoeuvre unlike british english which is split between  ise and  ize in words such as organise and realise with  ize favoured by the  and  ise listed as a variant  ize is rare in australian english and designated as a variant by the macquarie dictionary ae and oe are often maintained in words such as manoeuvre paedophilia and foetus excepting those listed below however the macquarie dictionary lists forms with e eg pedophilia fetus as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within australian english towards using only e individual words where the perred spelling is listed by the macquarie dictionary as being different from the british spellings include program in all contexts as opposed to programme inquire and derivatives inquired inquiry etc as opposed to enquire and derivatives analog as opposed to digital as opposed to analogue livable as opposed to liveable guerilla as opposed to guerrilla yoghurt as opposed to yogurt verandah as opposed to veranda burqa as opposed to burka and pastie food as opposed to pasty name fourth edition 2005the macquarie dictionary fourth edition  the macquarie library pty ltd 2005  name macquariedictionarycomauhttp  wwwmacquariedictionarycomau  name oxforddictionariescomhttp  oxforddictionariescom  unspaced prepositions such as onto anytime alright and anymore are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts name fourth edition 2005the macquarie dictionary fourth edition  the macquarie library pty ltd 2005  name macquariedictionarycomau  name oxforddictionariescom 
different spellings have existed throughout australias history a pamphlet entitled the so called american spelling published in sydney some time in the 19th century argued that there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the u in such words as honor labor etc name   ljnijothe so called american spelling its consistency examined pre 1901 pamphlet sydney e j forbes quoted by annie potts in http  wwwbikwilcom vintage19 websters dictionaryhtml this article  the pamphlet also claimed that the tendency of people in australasia is to excise the u and one of the sydney morning papers habitually does this while the other generally follows the older form what are today regarded as american spellings were popular in australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the victorian department of education endorsing them into the 1970s and  newspaper until the 1990s this influence can be seen in the spelling of the  and also in some place names such as  the  has been attributed with re establishing the dominance of the british spellings in the 1920s and 1930shttp  wwwparadisecorgau blog 2008 01 webster in australia   for a short time during the late 20th century s 1969 spelling orm proposal  gained some support in australia in 1975 the  adopted sr1 as a policyhttp  wwwenglishspellingsocietyorg journals j2 jimmiesonphp spelling reform 1   and nothing else simplified spelling society newsletter  sr1 calls for the short  sound as in bet to be spelt with e for example friend→frend head→hed

an ambush is a long established  in which  take advantage of concealment and the  to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions such as among dense  or behind tops ambushes have been used consistently throughout history from  to 
the use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game   
more recently an ambush often might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale such as over a  ambushes appear many times in  military history one outstanding example from ancient times is the  river hannibal encamped within striking distance of the romans with the trebia river between them and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment near the battle zone he had noticed says polybius a place between the two camps flat indeed and treeless but well adapted for an ambuscade as it was traversed by a water course with steep banks densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy 
when the roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear the result was slaughter and defeat for the romans nevertheless the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force although most of the legions were lost about 10000 romans cut their way through to safety maintaining  this ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a  is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation see ranger erence below
another famous ambush was that sprung by germanic warchief  against the romans at  this particular ambush was to have an impact on the course of western history the germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush they took cover in difficult forested terrain allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection they had the element of surprise and this was also aided by the defection of arminius from roman ranks prior to the battle they sprang the attack when the romans were most vulnerable when they had left their fortified camp and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm 
the germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly using a massive series of short rapid vicious charges against the length of the whole roman line with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place the germans also made use of blocking obstacles erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder roman movement along the route of the killing zone the result was mass slaughter of the romans and the destruction of 3 legions the germanic victory caused a limit on roman expansion in the west ultimately it established the rhine as the boundary of the roman empire for the next four hundred years until the decline of the roman influence in the west the roman empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer germania beyond the rhine
according to muslim tradition islamic prophet muhammad made use of ambush tactics in his military campaigns his first such use was during the  in the kharrar caravan raid sa`d ibn abi waqqas was ordered to lead a raid against the  his group consisted of about twenty muhajirs this raid was done about a month after the previous sad with his soldiers set up an ambush in the valley of  on the road to mecca and waited to raid a returning meccan caravan from syria but the caravan had already passed and the muslims returned to medina without any loot name mubarakpuri the sealed nectar p 127mubarakpuri the sealed nectar free version p 127  name haykal 1976 
arab tribes during muhammads era also made use of ambush tactics  one example retold in muslim tradition is said to have taken place during the  the banu thalabah tribe were already aware of the impending attack so they lay in wait for the muslims and when muhammad ibn maslama arrived at the sitethe banu thalabah with 100 men ambushed them while the muslims were making preparation to sleep and after a brief resistance killed all of muhammad ibn maslama’s men muhammad ibn maslama pretended to be dead a muslim who happened to pass that way found him and assisted him to return to  the raid was unsuccessful name mubarakpuri  
in modern warfare an ambush is most often employed by ground troops up to  size against enemy targets which may be other ground troops or possibly vehicles however in some situations especially when deep behind enemy lines the actual attack will be carried out by a platoon a  sized unit will be deployed to support the attack group setting up and maintaining a forward patrol harbour from which the attacking force will deploy and to which they will retire after the attack
ambushes are complex multi phase operations and are theore usually planned in some detail first a suitable killing zone is identified  this is the place where the ambush will be laid it is generally a place where enemy units are expected to pass and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment execution and extraction phases of the ambush patrol a path along a wooded valley floor would be a typical example
ambush can be described geometrically as
 linear when a number of firing units are equally distant from the linear 
 l shaped when a short leg of firing units are placed to  fire the length of the sides of the linear kill zone
 v shaped when the firing units are distant from the kill zone at the end where the enemy enters so the firing units lay down bands of intersecting and interlocking fire this ambush is normally triggered only when the enemy is well into the kill zone the intersecting bands of fire prevent any attempt of moving out of the kill zonehttp  wwwglobalsecurityorg military library policy army fm 7 85 ch6htm fm 7 85 chapter 6 special light infantry operations   bot generated title    
ambush criteria the terrain for the ambush had to meet strict criteria
 provide concealment to prevent detection from the ground or air
 enable ambush force to deploy encircle and divide the enemy
 allow for heavy weapons emplacements to provide sustained fire
 enable the ambush force to set up observation posts for early detection of the enemy
 permit the secret movement of troops to the ambush position and the dispersal of troops during withdrawal
one important feature of the ambush was that the target units should pile up after being attacked thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the  and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy the terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force or which offered some protection to the target was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre registered for mortars
ambush units the nva vc ambush formations consisted of
 lead blocking element
 main assault element
 rear blocking element
 observation posts
 command post
other elements might also be included if the situation demanded such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement
command posts when deploying into an ambush site the nva first occupied several observation posts placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using its strength and firepower as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander usually one main op and several secondary ops were established runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the ops and the main command post the ops were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options frequently the ops were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security the command post was situated in a central location often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site
recon methods recon elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300–500 meters away sometimes a leapfrogging recon technique was used surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other as the enemy drew close to the first it fell back behind the last recon team leaving an advance group in its place this one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap and the cycle rotated this method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points and allowed the recon groups to cover one another name rand corprand corp insurgent organization and operations a case study of the viet cong in the delta 1964–1966 santa monica august 1967

an abzyme from  and  also called catmab from catalytic monoclonal antibody and most often called catalytic antibody is a  with   abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptans but some natural abzymes can be found in normal humans anti vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies and in patients with  such as  where they can bind to and hydrolyze  to date abzymes display only weak modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical usehttp  courseschemindianaedu c582 documents hilvertabsreview_000pdf   they are however subjects of considerable academic interest  studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms enzyme structure and function catalysis and the immune system itself
enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state of a chemical reaction thereby enabling the formation of an otherwise less favorable molecular intermediate between the reactants and the products   if an antibody is developed to bind to a molecule thats structurally and electronically similar to the transition state of a given chemical reaction the developed antibody will bind to and stabilize the transition state just like a natural enzyme lowering the activation energy of the reaction and thus catalyzing the reaction by raising an antibody to bind to a stable transition state analog a new and unique type of enzyme is produced
so far all catalytic antibodies produced have displayed only modest weak catalytic activity the reasons for low catalytic activity for these molecules have been widely discussed possibilities indicate that factors beyond the binding site may play an important in particular through protein dynamics   some abzymes have been engineered to use metal ions and other s to improve their catalytic activityhttp  www2southeasternedu academics faculty dnorwood oldseminars spring04 seminarnicholaspdf http  wwwhighbeamcom doc 1g1 9343909html 
the possibility of catalyzing a reaction by means of an antibody which binds the transition state was first suggested by  in 1969http  wwwdschunivtriesteit ~benedetti antibody_catalysishtm   in 1994  and  received the prestigious  for developing catalytic antibodies for many reactions and popularizing their study into a significant sub field of enzymologyhttp  www2lblgov science articles archive peter schultz wolf prizehtml 
in a june 2008 issue of the journal autoimmunity review  name physorg  researchers s planque sudhir paul phd and yasuhiro nishiyama phd of the university of texas medical school at houston announced that they have engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the   binding site this is the one part of the   outer coating that does not change because it is the attachment point to  the key cell in cell mediated immunity once infected by hiv patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat  the antibodies are ineffective because of the virus ability to change their coats rapidly because this protein gp120 is necessary for hiv to attach it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the hiv variant population
the abzyme does more than bind to the site it catalytically destroys the site rendering the virus inert and then can attack other hiv viruses a single abzyme molecule can destroy thousands of hiv viruses

in  adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly into a multitude of new forms particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available creates new challenges or opens new environmental niches  name schluter2000  starting with a recent single ancestor this process results in the  and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits with which they can exploit a range of divergent environments name schluter2000  
adaptive radiation a characteristic example of  can be graphically illustrated as a bush or  of coexisting species on the 
 name levin 21   are a particularly interesting example of an adaptive radiationhttp  www87homepagevillanovaedu toddjackman anolis parallelhtml parallel adaptive radiations   caribbean anoline lizards tood jackman villanova university retrieved 10 september 2013   the hawaiian islands are very isolated and contribute numerous examples of adaptive radiation  an exceptional example of adaptive radiation would be the avian species of the hawaiian honeycreepers  via natural selection these birds adapted rapidly and converged based on the different environments of the hawaiian islands 
much research has been done on adaptive radiation due to its dramatic effects on the diversity of a population  however more research is needed especially to fully understand the many factors affecting adaptive radiation  both empirical and theoretical approaches are helpful though each has its disadvantages  in order to procure the largest amount of data empirical and theoretical approaches must be unitedgavrilets s amp losos j b 2009 adaptive radiation contrasting theory with 
data science 3235915 732 737 
 
four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation name schluter2000  
# a common ancestry of component species specifically a recent ancestry note that this is not the same as a  in which all descendants of a common ancestor are included
# a phenotype environment correlation a significant association between environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to exploit those environments
# trait utility the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in their corresponding environments
# rapid speciation presence of one or more bursts in the emergence of new species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is underway
the evolution of a novel feature may permit a clade to diversify by making new areas of morphospace accessible a classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth this trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on evolution of this character has thus increased the number of s available to mammals the trait arose a number of times in different groups during the  and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation name jernvall1996  birds find other ways to provide for each other ie the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore initiating an adaptive radiation 
other examples include  gestation for n mammals or  in  name levin 21  
adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain the colonizing population may diversify rapidly taking advantage of all possible niches
in  an isolated lake which formed recently in the african rift valley over 300 species of  fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15000 years
adaptive radiations commonly follow s following an extinction many niches are left vacant a classic example of this is the replacement of the non avian dinosaurs with mammals at the  and of s by bivalves at the 
one famous example where adaptive radiation is seen is with   it has been observed by many evolutionary biologists that fragmented landscapes oftentimes are a prime location for adaptive radiation to occur  the differences in geography throughout disjointed landscapes such as islands are believed to promote such diversification  darwin’s finches occupy the fragmented landscape of the galapagos islands and are diversified into many different species which differ in ecology song and morphology specifically the size and shapes of their beaks  the first obvious explanation for these differences is allopatric speciation speciation that occurs when populations of the same species become isolated geographically and evolve separately  because the finches are divided amongst the islands the birds have been evolving separately for several million years  however this does not account for the fact that many of the species occur in sympatry with seven or more species inhabiting the same island name petren k 2005petren k grant p r grant b r amp keller l f 2005 comparative landscape genetics and the adaptive radiation of darwins finches the role of peripheral isolation molecular ecology 1410 2943 2957   this raises the question as to why these species split when living in the same environment with all the same resources  petren grant grant and keller proposed that the speciation of the finches occurred in two parts an initial easily observable allopatric event followed by a less clear sympatric event this sympatric event which occurred second was adaptive radiation name petren k 2005   this occurred largely to promote specialization upon each island  one major morphological difference among species sharing one island is beak size and shape  adaptive radiation led to the evolution of different beaks which could access different food and resources  those with short beaks are better adapted to eating seeds on the ground those with thin sharp beaks eat insects and those with long beaks use their beaks to probe for food inside cacti  with these specializations seven or more species of finches are able to inhabit the same environments without competition or lack of resources killing several off  in other words these morphological differences in beak size and shape brought about by adaptive radiation allow the island diversification to persist
another famous example is the  fishes in lakes of the east african rift  the lakes in this area are believed to support and sustain about 2000 different species of these fish each with different ecological and morphological characteristics such as body sizelosos jonathan b adaptive radiation ecological opportunity and evolutionary determinism the american naturalist 1756 2010 623 39 web 28 oct 2014   like the galapagos islands these lakes form a fragmented landscape that isolates the cichlid fish from one another allowing them and many of the organisms they live with to evolve separately  the diversity of the lakes is in fact quite extraordinary because the adaptive radiations here are sometimes so young  one thing that has interested scientists about the cichlid fish case is the possibility of convergent evolution or the evolution of analogous structures independently driven by similar environmental selection pressures  however quantitative studies on the convergent evolution of the cichlid fish are limitedlosos jonathan b adaptive radiation ecological opportunity and evolutionary determinism the american naturalist 1756 2010 623 39 web 28 oct 2014 
another example of an adaptive radiation would be an  species of the hawaiian islands  the s are a large highly diverse species which have been part of a vast adaptive radiation that began as the hawaiian islands started to form  the honeycreeper species was shaped by island formation and natural selection  the mechanism by which this adaptive radiation occurred can be described as  via the peripheral isolate model  each time a new island formed a dispersal event would occur which would result in new community structures on each island new selection pressures forced the adaptive radiation of the hawaiian honeycreepers as they needed to exploit new resources from the different environments of each island   it has been determined that many of the similar morphologies and behaviors of the hawaiian honeycreepers located on distant islands are due to convergence of analogous traits caused by similar environments 
though the most famously recognized cases of adaptive radiation have occurred in animals such as darwin’s finches or the cichlid fish adaptive radiation certainly occurs in plant species as well  the most famous example of adaptive radiation in plants is quite possibly the hawaiian silverswords  the hawaiian  consists of twenty eight species of hawaiian plants which range from trees to shrubs to vines  this is exceptional diversification as can be seen through the significant morphological differences between each species of the hawaiian silverswordsbaldwin bruce g and michael j sanderson age and rate of diversification of the hawaiian silversword alliance compositae proceedings of the national academy of sciences 9516 1998 9402 9406   with some species it’s virtually impossible to distinguish visually that they were ever part of one species to begin with these radiations occurred millions of years ago but through studies over the past few decades it has been suggested that the rate of speciation and diversification was extremely high  these high rates as well as the fragmented landscape of the hawaiian islands are key characteristics which point directly to adaptive radiation
 lizards have been radiating widely in many different environments including central and south america as well as the west indies and experience great diversity of species just as the finches cichlid fish and silverswords  studies have been done to determine whether radiations occur similarly for these lizards on the mainland as they do on the caribbean islands or if differences can be observed in how they speciated  it has been observed that in fact the radiations are very different and ecological and morphological characteristics that these lizards developed as part of their speciation on the islands and on the mainland are uniqueirschick duncan j et al a comparison of evolutionary radiations in mainland and caribbean anolis lizards ecology 787 1997 2191 2203   they have clearly evolved differently to the environments they inhabit  the environmental pressures on the anolis lizards are not the same on the mainland as they are on the islands  there is a significantly larger amount of predators preying on the anolis lizards on the mainland  this is but one environmental difference  other factors play a role in what sort of adaptive radiation will develop  among the caribbean islands a larger perch diameter correlates with longer forelimbs larger body mass longer tails and longer hind limbs  however on the mainland a larger perch diameter correlates with shorter tails  this shows that these lizards adapted differently to their environment depending on whether they were located on the mainland or the islands  these differing characteristics reconfirm that most of the adaptive radiation between the mainland and the islands occurred independently  on the islands specifically species have adapted to certain “microhabitats” in which they require different morphological traits to survive  irschick 1997 divides these microhabitats into six groups “trunk–ground trunk–crown grass–bush crown–giant twig and trunk”  different groups of lizards would acquire traits for one of these particular areas that made them more specialized for survival in this microhabitat and not so much in others  adaptive radiation allows species to acquire the traits they need to survive in these microhabitats and reduce competition to allow the survival of a greater number of organisms as seen in many of the examples before

agarose gel electrophoresis is a method of  used in   genetics and clinical chemistry to separate a mixed population of dna or proteins in a matrix of  the proteins may be separated by charge and or size  agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent and the  and  fragments by length  biomolecules are separated by applying an  to move the charged molecules through an  matrix and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrixsambrook j russel dw 2001 molecular cloning a laboratory manual 3rd ed cold spring harbor laboratory press cold spring harbor ny 
agarose gels are easy to cast and are particularly suitable for separating dna of size range most often encountered in laboratories which accounts for the popularity of its use the separated dna may be viewed with stain most commonly under uv light and the dna fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease most agarose gels used are between 07   2% dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer
agarose gel is a three dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass  the 3 d structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can theore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state the melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature depending on the sources agarose gel has a gelling temperature of 35 42ampnbsp°c and a melting temperature of 85 95ampnbsp°c low melting and low gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available
agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength that made it particularly suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of dna and large protein molecules the pore size of a 1% gel has been estimated from 100ampnbspnm to 200 500ampnbspnm name zimm  name viovy  and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as 015% to form a slab for gel electrophoresis name serwer  low concentration gels 01   02% however are fragile and theore hard to handle agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for dna but has a greater range of separation and is theore used for dna fragments of usually 50 20000 bp in size the limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb but resolution of over 6 mb is possible with  pfge  it can also be used to separate large proteins and it is the perred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than 5 10ampnbspnm a 09% agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of  name serwer 
the agarose polymer contains charged groups in particular  and  name lonza   these negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of dna in a process called  eeo and can theore retard the movement of dna and cause blurring of bands higher concentration gel would have higher electroosmotic flow low eeo agarose is theore generally perred for use in agarose  but high eeo agarose may be used for other purposes the lower sulphate content of low eeo agarose particularly low melting point lmp agarose is also beneficial in cases where the dna extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures such as  and   zero eeo agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged group and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions 
a number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids the dimension of the gel pores gel concentration size of dna being electrophoresed the voltage used the ionic strength of the buffer and the concentration of intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis 
smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules in gel and double stranded dna moves at a rate that is inversely proportional to the logsub10 sub of the number of base pairs this relationship however breaks down with very large dna fragments and separation of very large dna fragments requires the use of  pfge
for standard agarose gel electrophoresis larger molecules are resolved better using a low concentration gel while smaller molecules separate better at high concentration gel high concentrations gel however requires longer run times sometimes days
the movement of the dna may be affected by the  of the dna molecule for example  usually moves faster than relaxed dna because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact in a normal plasmid dna preparation multiple forms of dna may be present  gel electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show the negatively supercoiled form as the main band while nicked dna open circular form and the relaxed closed circular form appears as minor bands the rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions name sambrook1  and the mobility of larger circular dna may be more strongly affected than linear dna by the pore size of the gel 
ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular dna can change the charge length as well as the superhelicity of the dna molecule theore its presence in gel during electrophoresis can affect its movement agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular dna with different supercoiling topology 
dna damage due to increased ing will also reduce electrophoretic dna migration in a dose dependent way  
the rate of migration of the dna is proportional to the voltage applied ie the higher the voltage the faster the dna moves the resolution of large dna fragments however is lower at high voltage the mobility of dna may also change in an unsteady field   in a field that is periodically reversed the mobility of dna of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency name zimm   this phenomenon can result in band inversion in field inversion gel electrophoresis fige whereby larger dna fragments move faster than smaller ones
 smiley gels   this edge effect is caused when the voltage applied is too high for the gel concentration used  
 overloading of dna   overloading of dna slows down the migration of dna fragments
 contamination   presence of impurities such as salts or proteins can affect the movement of the dna
the negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the dna towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis however the migration of dna molecules in solution in the absence of a gel matrix is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis name zimm  name old amp primrose   the gel matrix is theore responsible for the separation of dna by size during electrophoresis and a number of models exist to explain the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix a widely accepted one is the ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve a globular protein or a  dna moves through the interconnected pores and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix and the molecules of different sizes can theore be separated in this sieving process name zimm  
the ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule for dna molecules of size greater than 1 kb a  model or its variants is most commonly used this model assumes that the dna can crawl in a snake like fashion hence reptation through the pores as an elongated molecule a biased reptation model applies at higher electric field strength whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction and pulls the rest of the molecule along name microfluidics   real time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules however showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis with the dna showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball or becoming hooked into a u shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres  
the details of an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment may vary depending on methods but most follow a general procedure
the gel is prepared by dissolving the agarose powder in an appropriate buffer such as tae or tbe to be used in electrophoresis   the agarose is dispersed in the buffer before heating it to near boiling point but avoid boiling the melted agarose is allowed to cool sufficiently before pouring the solution into a cast as the cast may warp or crack if the agarose solution is too hot a comb is placed in the cast to create wells for loading sample and the gel should be completely set before use
the concentration of gel affects the resolution of dna separation for a standard agarose gel electrophoresis a 08% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb dna fragments while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 02–1kb fragments 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis   the concentration is measured in weight of agarose over volume of buffer used g ml high percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly while low percentage gels 01 02% are fragile and not easy to handle low melting point lmp agarose gels are also more fragile than normal agarose gel  low melting point agarose may be used on its own or simultaneously with standard agarose for the separation and isolation of dna  pfge and fige are often done with high percentage agarose gels
once the gel has set the comb is removed leaving wells where dna samples can be loaded loading buffer is mixed with the dna sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells the loading buffer contains a dense compound which may be glycerol sucrose or  that raises the density of the sample so that the dna sample may sink to the bottom of the well if the dna sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation it may float out of the well the loading buffer also include colored dyes such as  and  used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis the dna samples are loaded using a 
agarose gel electrophoresis is most commonly done horizontally in a submarine mode whereby the slab gel is completely submerged in buffer during electrophoresis it is also possible but less common to perform the electrophoresis vertically as well as horizontally with the gel raised on agarose legs using an appropriate apparatus   the buffer used in the gel is the same as the running buffer in the electrophoresis tank which is why electrophoresis in the submarine mode is possible with agarose gel
for optimal resolution of dna greater than 2kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis 5 to 8 v cm is recommended the distance in cm ers to the distance between electrodes theore this recommended voltage would be 5 to 8 multiplied by the distance between the electrodes in cm name sambrook1    voltage may also be limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if it is run at high voltage for a prolonged period especially if the gel used is lmp agarose gel too high a voltage may also reduce resolution as well as causing band streaking for large dna molecules too low a voltage may lead to broadening of band for small dna fragments due to dispersion and diffusion 
since dna is not visible in natural light the progress of the electrophoresis is monitored using colored dyes xylene cyanol light blue color comigrates large dna fragments while bromophenol blue dark blue comigrates with the smaller fragments less commonly used dyes include  and  which migrate ahead of bromophenol blue a  is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the dna fragments note however that the size of a circular dna like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by  alternatively a supercoiled dna marker may be used
dna as well as rna are normally visualized by staining with  which intercalates into the major grooves of the dna and fluoresces under uv light the ethidium bromide may be added to the agarose solution before it gels or the dna gel may be stained later after electrophoresis destaining of the gel is not necessary but may produce better images other methods of staining are available examples are      sulphate and   sybr green gelred and other similar commercial products are sold as safer alternatives to ethidium bromide as it has been shown to be  in  although the  of ethidium bromide has not actually been established sybr green requires the use of a blue light transilluminator dna stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a uv transilluminator which is an advantage however it may not produce a strong band
when stained with ethidium bromide the gel is viewed with an  uv transilluminator standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302 312 nm uv b however exposure of dna to uv radiation for as little as 45 seconds can produce damage to dna and affect subsequent procedures for example reducing the efficiency of  in vitro  and    exposure of the dna to uv radiation theore should be limited using a higher wavelength of 365ampnbspnm uv a range causes less damage to the dna but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images while the longer wavelength should be used when it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time
the transilluminator apparatus may also contain image capture devices such as a digital or polaroid camera that allow an image of the gel to be taken or printed
the separated dna bands are often used for further procedures and a dna band may be cut out of the gel as a slice dissolved and purified the gels may also be used for blotting techniques
in general the ideal buffer should have good conductivity produce less heat and have a long life  there are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis common ones for nucleic acids include  tae and  tbe many other buffers have been proposed eg  lb which is almost never used based on pubmed citations iso electric histidine pk matched goods buffers etc in most cases the purported rationale is lower current less heat and or matched ion mobilities which leads to longer buffer life tris phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if dna extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction borate is problematic borate can polymerize and or interact with cis diols such as those found in rna tae has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger dna this means a lower voltage and more time but a better product lb is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp however with its low conductivity a much higher voltage could be used up to 35 v cm which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis as low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium 1 mm lithium boratebrody jr kern se 2004 history and principles of conductive media for standard dna electrophoresis anal biochem 33311 13 pmid 15351274 http  wwwccahschulaacth molmed dna%20electro%27s%20conductive%20mediapdf pdf   the buffers used contain edta to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function

agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis samples are also easily recovered after the experiment is finished the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a rigerator
electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce ph changes due to the electric field which is important because the charge of dna and rna depends on ph but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution further different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other for morphological or other reasons

an allele  or  or allel is one of a number of alternative forms of the same  or same  name collins  name basic glossary on genetic epidemiology  sometimes different alleles can result in different observable s such as different  however most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation
most s have two sets of s that is they are   these chromosomes are erred to as s diploid organisms have one copy of each  and theore one allele on each chromosome if both alleles are the same they and the organism are  with respect to that gene if the alleles are different they and the organism are  with respect to that gene
the word allele is a short form of allelomorph other form which was used in the early days of  to describe variant forms of a  detected as different  it derives from the greek pix ἀλλήλ allel meaning reciprocal or each other which itself is related to the greek adjective ἄλλος allos cognate with latin alius meaning other
in many cases genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as  or  according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the heterozygote most resembles where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes the allele involved is said to be  to the other which is said to be  to the former name essential genetics a genomics perspective  the degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci this type of interaction was first formally described by  however many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by  and 
the term  allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in wild populations of organisms such as fruit flies  such a wild type allele was historically regarded as dominant common and normal in contrast to  alleles regarded as recessive rare and frequently deleterious it was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the wild type allele at most gene loci and that any alternative mutant allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of affected individuals often as  and more frequently in heterozygous form in  for the mutant allele it is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic with multiple alleles whose frequencies vary from population to population and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences
a population or  of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each  among various individuals allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles  present or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population a  is a gene variant that lacks the genes normal function because it either is not expressed or the expressed protein is inactive
for example at the gene locus for the    s in humans name  name onlinemendelianinheritanceinman  classical genetics recognizes three alleles isupa sup isupb sup and i that determine compatibility of s any individual has one of six possible s isupa supisupa sup isupa supi isupb supisupb sup isupb supi isupa supisupb sup and ii that produce one of four possible s type a produced by isupa supisupa sup homozygous and isupa supi heterozygous genotypes type b produced by isupb supisupb sup homozygous and isupb supi heterozygous genotypes type ab produced by isupa supisupb sup heterozygous genotype and type o produced by ii homozygous genotype it is now known that each of the a b and o alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different dna sequences that produce proteins with identical properties more than 70 alleles are known at the abo locus name sequence variation at the human abo locus  an individual with type a blood may be an ao heterozygote an aa homozygote or an aa heterozygote with two different a alleles
the frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes see  for a simple model with two alleles
 mathp + q 1 \  math
 mathp^2 + 2pq + q^2 1 \ math
where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the alternative allele which necessarily sum to unity then psup2 sup is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele 2pq is the fraction of heterozygotes and qsup2 sup is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele if the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is psup2 sup + 2pq and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is qsup2 sup
with three alleles
 mathp + q + r   1 \  math and
 mathp^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr   1 \ math
in the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus the number of possible genotypes g with a number of alleles a is given by the expression
 mathg  \frac{aa+1}{2}  math
a number of  are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single gene trait recessive genetic disorders include     pku and  other disorders are also due to recessive alleles but because the gene locus is located on the x chromosome so that males have only one copy that is they are  they are more frequent in males than in females examples include red green  and 
other disorders such as  occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele

antimicrobial resistance amr is when  are less treatable with one or more  medications used to treat or prevent  name who2014  there are three main ways by which resistance can occur by natural resistance in certain types of bacteria by genetic  or by one species acquiring resistance from another  resistance can happen spontaneously owing to random mutations to a buildup of resistance over time or to  name about antimicrobial resistance  although the latter two pathways are the most important resistant microbes become increasingly difficult to treat requiring alternative medications or higher doses both of which may be more costly or  microbes which are resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called  mdr in the press these organisms are often erred to as superbugs name cdcgetsmart  antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly problematic issue that leads to millions of deaths every year name who 2014  a few infections become completely untreatable due to resistance all classes of microbes develop resistance fungi  resistance es  resistance   resistance   resistance of those categories bacterial antibiotic resistance poses the largest threat to 
   prevention   
antibiotics should only be used when needed and only when prescribed by health professionals name swedish  when antibiotics are being prescribed the prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration the right patient the right drug the right dose the right route and the right time  narrow spectrum antibiotics should be used rather than broad spectrum antibiotics when possible to effectively and accurately target specific organisms name nps2013  cultures should be taken before treatment when indicated and treatment potentially changed based on the susceptibility report name cdc mission   for people who will be self administering these medications in the home setting emphasis must be placed on education about proper use of the drug in practice health care providers should try to minimize spread of resistant infections by using proper sanitations techniques including  or disinfecting between each patient and should encourage the same of the patient visitors and family members name cdc mission 
   epidemiology  
the rising trend in drug resistance can be attributed to three primary areas use of antibiotics in the human population use of antibiotics in the animal population and the spread of resistant strains between human or non human sources name about antimicrobial resistance  any use of antibiotics can increase  in a population of bacteria causing vulnerable bacteria to die thereby increasing the relative numbers of resistant bacteria and allowing for further growth as resistance to antibiotics becomes more common there is greater need for alternative treatments call for new antibiotic therapies have been issued but there is continuing decline in the number of  approved drugs  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has developed a monitoring program for the top 18 drug resistant threats in the united states categorized by level of concern examples of common types of drug resistant bacteria include  mrsa  vrsa  esbl  vre  mrab

a  who report released april 2014 stated this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone of any age in any country antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health name whointhttp  wwwwhoint mediacentre news releases 2014 amr report en  whos first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious worldwide threat to public health retrieved 2014 05 02  there have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat including a proposal for an  on antimicrobial resistance  antibiotic resistance is not properly mapped across the world but the countries that are affected the most are poorer countries with already weaker healthcare systems name swedish 
the who defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganisms resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism name who2014 
a person cannot become resistant to antibiotics resistance is a property of the microbe not a person or other organism infected by a microbe 
bacteria with resistance to antibiotics predate medical use of antibiotics by humans  however widespread antibiotic use has made more bacteria resistant through the process of  
reasons for the widespread use of antibiotics include
increasing global availability over time since the 1950s
uncontrolled sale in many low or middle income countries where they can be obtained over the counter without a prescription potentially resulting in antibiotics being used when not indicated name lid13the lancet infectious diseases commission http  wwwprincetonedu pei news s1473309913703189 mainpdf antibiotic resistance—the need for global solutions lancet infect dis 201313 1057–98  this may result in emergence of resistance in any remaining  bacteria
 feed at low doses for growth promotion is an accepted practice in many industrialized countries and is known to lead to increased levels of resistance  name mathew  releasing large quantities of antibiotics into the environment during pharmaceutical manufacturing through inadequate wastewater treatment increases the risk that antibiotic resistant strains will develop and spread   it is uncertain whether antibacterials in soaps and other products contribute to antibiotic resistance but they are discouraged for other reasons  
increasing bacterial resistance is linked with the volume of antibiotic prescribed as well as missing doses when taking antibiotics name pechère jc 2001 s170–3  inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has been attributed to a number of causes including people insisting on antibiotics physicians prescribing them as they feel they do not have time to explain why they are not necessary and physicians not knowing when to prescribe antibiotics or being overly cautious for medical and or legal reasons name arn2005 
up to half of antibiotics used in humans are unnecessary and inappropriate name about antimicrobial resistance  for example a third of people believe that antibiotics are effective for the   and the common cold is the most common reason antibiotics are prescribed  even though antibiotics are useless against viruses a single regimen of antibiotics even in compliant individuals leads to a greater risk of resistant organisms to that antibiotic in the person for a month to possibly a year  
antibiotic resistance increases with duration of treatment theore as long as an effective minimum is kept shorter courses of antibiotics are likely to decrease rates of resistance reduce cost and have better outcomes with fewer complications name nps2013  short course regimens exist for     suspected lung infections in intense care wards  so called   middle ear infections sinusitis and throat infections  and penetrating gut injuries   in some situations a short course may not cure the infection as well as a long course  a  editorial recommended that antibiotics can often be safely stopped 72ampnbsphours after symptoms resolve  because individuals may feel better before the infection is eradicated doctors must provide instructions to them so they know when it is safe to stop taking a prescription some researchers advocate doctors using a very short course of antibiotics reevaluating the patient after a few days and stopping treatment if there are no clinical signs of infectionmarc bonten md eijkman winkler institute for medical microbiology utrecht the netherland   http  hicsigwikiasidnetau images 4 41 should_you_stop_an_antibiotic_course_early_if_you_feel_better_r_evertspdf infectious diseases and inflammation 
certain  result in resistance more than others increased rates of mrsa infections are seen when using  s and    cephalosporins and particularly quinolones and  are more likely to produce colonisation with   
factors within the intensive care unit setting such as mechanical ventilation and multiple underlying diseases also appear to contribute to bacterial resistance  poor hand hygiene by hospital staff has been associated with the spread of resistant organisms  and an increase in hand washing compliance results in decreased rates 
improper use of antibiotics can often be attributed to the presence of  in particular regions socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy the efficacy of treatment programs for drug resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violencefarmer paul e bruce nizeye sara stulac and salmaan keshavjee 2006 structural violence and clinical medicine plos medicine 1686–1691 url  
the  concluded that inappropriate use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is an underlying contributor to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant germs and that the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited the  has added to the terrestrial animal health code a series of guidelines with recommendations to its members for the creation and harmonization of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programs  monitoring of the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry  and recommendations to ensure the proper and prudent use of antibiotic substances another guideline is to implement methodologies that help to establish associated risk factors and assess the risk of antibiotic resistance 
eighty percent of antibiotics sold in the united states are used on livestock the majority of these antibiotics are given to animals that are otherwise healthy rather it is normal practice to mix antibiotics with livestock food to promote healthier living conditions and to encourage animal growth  the use of antibiotics in animals is to a large degree involved in the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganismshttp  wwwncbinlmnihgov books nbk97126  the resistance phenomenon in microbes and infectious disease vectors implications for human health and strategies for containment workshop summary institute of medicine us forum on emerging infections knobler sl lemon sm najafi m et al editors washington dc national academies press us 2003  antibiotics are used in food with the intention of not only preventing controlling and treating diseases but also to promote growth name about antimicrobial resistance  antibiotic use in animals can be classified into therapeutic prophylactic metaphylactic and growth promotion uses of antibiotics   all four patterns select for bacterial resistance since antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process but the non therapeutic uses expose larger number of animals and theore of bacteria for more extended periods and at lower doses they theore greatly increase the cross section for the evolution of resistance
  since the last third of the 20th century antibiotics have been used extensively  in  in 2013 80% of antibiotics used in the us were used in animals and only 20% in humans in 1997 half were used in humans and half in animals name therealnews 2014 05 18  some antibiotics are not used and not considered significant for use in humans because they either lack efficacy or purpose in humans such as s in ruminants  or because the drug has gone out of use in humans others are used in both animals and humans including penicillin and some forms of tetracyclinethe editorial board of the  may 10 2014 http  wwwnytimescom 2014 05 11 opinion sunday the rise of antibiotic resistancehtml opinionamp_r 0 the rise of antibiotic resistance  historically regulation of antibiotic use in food animals has been limited to limiting drug residues in meat egg and milk products rather than by direct concern over the development of antibiotic resistance this mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine where in general researchers and doctors were more concerned about effective but non toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance
in 2001 the  estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the us are given to food animals for example chickens pigs and cattle in the absence of disease name therealnews 2014 05 18   the amounts given are termed sub therapeutic ie insufficient to combat disease despite no diagnosis of disease the administration of these drugs most of which are not significant to human medicine results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated it is theorized that sub therapeutic dosages kills some but not all of the bacterial organisms in the animal — likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic resistanthttp  wwwncbinlmnihgov books nbk114485  antibiotic resistance   linking human and animal health improving food safety through a one health approach workshop summary wegener henrik c washington dc national academies press us 2012  studies have shown however that in essence the overall population levels of bacteria are unchanged only the mix of bacteria is affected the actual mechanism by which sub therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promoters is thus unclear some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub clinical infections which would be cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed thereby allowing the creatures to thrive no convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory and the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives the mechanism of growth promotion is theore probably something other than killing off the bad bugs
antibiotics are used in us animal feed to promote animal productivity name mathew   in particular poultry feed and water is a common route of administration of drugs due to higher overall costs when drugs are administered by handling animals individually
in research studies occasional animal to human spread of antibiotic resistant organisms has been demonstrated resistant bacteria can be transmitted from animals to humans in three ways by consuming s milk meat eggs etc from close or direct contact with animals or other humans or through the environment  in the first pathway  methods can help eliminate decrease or prevent the growth of bacteria in some food classes evidence for the transfer of macrolide resistant microorganisms from animals to humans has been scant and most evidence shows that pathogens of concern in human populations originated in humans and are maintained there with rare cases of transference to humans name pmid15151237  name pmid18643826

antibiotic resistance is a growing problem among humans and wildlife in terrestrial or aquatic environments in this respect the spread and contamination of the environment especially through hot spots such as hospital wastewater and untreated urban wastewater is a growing and serious public health problem  antibiotics have been polluting the environment since their introduction through human waste medication farming animals and the pharmaceutical industry name martinez j l 2012 pp 151  171martinez j l amp olivares j 2012 envrironmental pollution by antibiotic resistance genes in p l keen amp m h montforts antimicrobial resistance in the environment pp 151  171 hoboken nj john wiley amp sons  along with antibiotic waste resistant bacteria follow thus introducing antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment as bacteria replicate quickly the resistant bacteria that enter the environment replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide in addition bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer theore even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment antibiotic resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure name martinez j l 2012 pp 151  171

excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance since the beginning of the antibiotic era antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease name andersson2011  overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance the main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses including viral infections like the common cold in an analysis of drug prescriptions 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection both viral in origin were given prescriptions for antibiotics name gilberg2003  these prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria
in a recent years  teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal use of antimicrobials  the goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance
there have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur a system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance
on march 27 2015 the white house released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria the task force for combating antibiotic resistant bacteria developed the national action plan for combating antibiotic resistant bacteria with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the us in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives this plan outlines steps taken by the federal government over the next give years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic resistant infections maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market and to help to develop future diagnostics antibiotics and vaccines name whitehousegov 
the action plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care public health veterinary medicine agriculture food safety and research and manufacturing these goals as listed by the white house are as follows 
 slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections
 strengthen national one health surveillance efforts to combat resistance
 advance development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria
 accelerate basic and applied research and development for new antibiotics other therapeutics and vaccines
 improve international collaboration and capacities for antibiotic resistance prevention surveillance control and antibiotic research and development
by following are goals set to meet by 2020 name whitehousegov 
 establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
 reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
 establishment of state antibiotic resistance ar prevention programs in all 50 states 
 elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food producing animals
the world health organization has promoted the first world antibiotic awareness week running from 16–22 november 2015 the aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance it also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance 
 
microorganisms do not develop resistance to s because a vaccine enhances the bodys immune system whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the bodys normal defenses furthermore if the use of vaccines increase there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs  however new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may  for example an updated  is needed each year
while theoretically promising antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy because of immunological variation between staphylococcus species and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway 
 
alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration

create a robust standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections  the network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy
establish a special medical use smu pathway for fda to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible
provide economic incentives especially for development of new classes of antibiotics to offset the steep rampd costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics

in 1997 european union health ministers voted to ban  and four additional antibiotics used to promote animal growth in 1999  in 2006 a ban on the use of antibiotics in european feed with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds became effective  in scandinavia there is evidence that the ban has led to a lower  of antibiotic resistance in nonhazardous animal bacterial populations  as of 2004 several european countries established a decline of antimicrobial resistance in humans through limiting the usage antimicrobials in agriculture and food industries without jeopardizing animal health or economic cost 
 
the  usda and the  fda collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals name gao 
the fda first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains in livestock the long established practice of permitting otc sales of antibiotics including penicillin and other drugs to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states
in 2000 the fda announced their intention to revoke approval of  use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistant  infections in humans legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006 name nelson 2007  fluroquinolones have been banned from extra label use in food animals in the usa since 2007 however they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals
during 2007 two federal bills s 549  and hr 962  aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic antibiotics in us food animal production the senate bill introduced by sen  died the house bill introduced by rep  died after being erred to committee
in march 2012 the  ruling in an action brought by the  and others ordered the fda to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock that violated fda regulations name mpfda  on april 11 2012 the fda announced a voluntary program to phase out unsupervised use of drugs as feed additives and convert approved over the counter uses for antibiotics to prescription use only requiring veterinarian supervision of their use and a prescription name nytprescription  name fdafaq  in december 2013 the fda announced the commencement of these steps to phase out the use of antibiotics for the purposes of promoting livestock growth name therealnews 2014 05 18  
growing us consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to greater availability of antibiotic free animal products  for example chicken producer perdue removed all human antibiotics from its feed and launched products labeled “antibiotic free” under the harvestland brand in 2007 consumer response was positive and in 2014 perdue also phased out ionophores from its hatchery and began using the “antibiotic free” labels on its harvestland simply smart and perfect portions products 
the four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are
#drug inactivation or modification for example enzymatic deactivation of  in some penicillin resistant bacteria through the production of  most commonly the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis name criswell daniel 2004criswell daniel the evolution of antibiotic resistance institute for creation research np 2004 web 28 oct 2014 
#alteration of target site for example alteration of —the binding target site of penicillins—in  and other penicillin resistant bacteria another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins these proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis the mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell which in turn changes its conformational shape this allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis 
#alteration of metabolic pathway for example some  resistant bacteria do not require  paba an important precursor for the synthesis of  and  in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides instead like mammalian cells they turn to using pormed folic acid
#reduced drug accumulation by decreasing drug  or increasing active  pumping out of the drugs across the cell surface  these specialized pumps can be found within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species and are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage these efflux pumps are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibioticri aminov ri mackie evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance genes microbiology letters 8 may 2007  
antibiotic resistance can be a result of 
  and also of unlinked point mutations in the   at a rate of about 1 in 10sup8 sup per chromosomal replication mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant a mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether research has shown the bacterial protein lexa may play a key role in the acquisition of bacterial mutations giving resistance to quinolones and rifampicin dna damage induces the sos gene repressor lexa to undergo autoproteolytic activity this includes the transcription of genes encoding pol ii pol iv and pol v which are three nonessential dna polymerases that are required for mutation in response to dna damage  the antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce they then pass this trait to their offspring which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony although these chromosomal mutations may seem to benefit the bacteria by providing antibiotic resistance they also confer a cost of fitness for example a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but it will also slow the process of protein synthesis name criswell daniel 2004  additionally a particular study specifically compared the overall fitness of antibiotic resistant strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium to their drug sensitive revertants they observed a reduced overall fitness in the antibiotic resistant strains especially in growth ratebr levin v perrot nina walker compensatory mutations antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria genetics march 1 2000 vol 154 no 3 985–997 
there are three known mechanisms of  resistance some types of  pumps can act to decrease intracellular  concentration  in gram negative bacteria plasmid mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to  protecting it from the action of quinolones finally mutations at key sites in dna gyrase or  can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones decreasing the drugs effectiveness 
antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols sometimes used as a  to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of dna that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest a recent study demonstrated that the extent of  among staphylococcus is much greater than previously expected—and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence and beyond genes residing within the  
for a long time it has been thought that for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic it must be in a large population however recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance we know now that small populations of ecoli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate the development of antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations and this is also true for the human body researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four snp mutations in the genome of ecoli produced by the gradient of antibiotic these mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance
 
 colloquially known as staph aureus or a staph infection is one of the major resistant pathogens found on the  and the  of around a third of the population it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure it was one of the earlier bacteria in which  resistance was found—in 1947 just four years after the drug started being mass produced  was then the antibiotic of choice but has since been replaced by  due to significant kidney toxicity  mrsa was first detected in britain in 1961 and is now quite common in hospitals mrsa was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of  in the  in 1999 up from 4% in 1991 half of all s aureus infections in the  are resistant to penicillin methicillin  and 
this left  as the only effective agent available at the time however strains with intermediate 4–8ampnbspμg ml levels of resistance termed glycopeptide intermediate staphylococcus aureus gisa or vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus visa began appearing in the late 1990s the first identified case was in japan in 1996 and strains have since been found in hospitals in england france and the us the first documented strain with complete 16ampnbspμg ml resistance to vancomycin termed  vrsa appeared in the united states in 2002  however in 2011 a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity

in   or  or its secreted form   in simpler terms an antigen is any substance that causes an immune system to produce antibodies against it  each antibody is specifically selected after binding to a certain antigen because of  in the antibody s
in summary an antigen is a  that binds to ag specific receptors but cannot induce an immune response in the body by itself name referencea  the term originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody it expanded to er to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment that can be recognized by highly variable antigen receptors  or  of the adaptive immune system
the antigen may originate from within the body self antigen or from the external environment non self the immune system usually does not react to self antigens under normal  conditions due to  of  in the  and is supposed to identify and attack only non self invaders from the outside world or modified harmful substances present in the body under

at the molecular level an antigen can be characterized by its ability to bind to an antibodys  different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific s present on the antigen surface  is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope in order to induce an immune response it has to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a   antigens are usually s and s and less frequently s this includes parts coats capsules cell walls flagella fimbrae and toxins of  es and other s s and s are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides non microbial non self antigens can include pollen egg white and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells s are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form which are intentionally administered to induce the memory function of  toward the antigens of the pathogen invading the recipient
 coined the term  in german antikörper in his  at the end of 19th century  in 1899  1874–1939 named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies substances immunogenes ou antigenes antigenic or immunogenic substances he originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies just as  is a precursor of an enzyme but by 1903 he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies antibodies and wrote that the word antigen is a contraction of antisomatogen  immunkörperbildner the oxford english dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be antibody gen name lindenmann 
  – the distinct surface features of an antigen its antigenic determinant antigenic molecules normally large biological polymers usually present surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies any such feature constitutes an epitope most antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies each of which is specific to one of the antigens epitopes using the lock and key metaphor the antigen can be seen as a string of keys epitopes each of which matches a different lock antibody different antibody  each have distinctly formed s
  – a substance capable of causing an  the detrimental reaction may result after exposure via ingestion inhalation injection or contact with skin

  binding protein – proteins such as   and  that are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen binding site while antigens are the target of antibodies immunoglobulin binding proteins attack antibodies 
 t dependent antigen – antigens that require the assistance of t cells to induce the formation of specific antibodies
 t independent antigen –  usually that stimulate b cells directly
 immunodominant antigens – antigens that dominate over all others from a  in their ability to produce an immune response t cell responses typically are directed against a relatively few immunodominant epitopes although in some cases eg infection with the  pathogen  it is dispersed over a relatively large number of parasite antigens 
antigens can be classified according to their source
exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside for example by   or  the immune systems response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical by  or  exogenous antigens are taken into the s apcs and processed into fragments apcs then present the fragments to  sup+ sup by the use of  molecules on their surface some t cells are specific for the peptidemhc complex they become activated and start to secrete s substances that activate  ctl antibody secreting   and other particles
some antigens start out as exogenous and later become endogenous for example intracellular viruses intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell
endogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal cell  or because of viral or intracellular bacterial  the fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with  molecules if activated  recognize them the t cells secrete various s that cause the  or  of the infected cell in order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self proteins the cytotoxic cells self reactive t cells are deleted as a result of  negative selection endogenous antigens include  heterologous  and  or  homologous antigens
an  is usually a normal protein or protein complex and sometimes dna or rna that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific  these antigens should not be under normal conditions the target of the immune system but their associated t cells are not deleted and instead attack
neoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome as compared with nonmutated self antigens neoantigens are of relevance to tumor control as the quality of the t cell pool that is available for these antigens is not affected by central t cell tolerance technology to systematically analyze t cell reactivity against neoantigens became available only recently name ss15

autosomal genetic disorders can arise due to a number of causes some of the most common being  in parental germ cells or  of deleterious alleles from parents autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an  or recessive fashion name 0   these disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency name 0   autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child as the child only needs to inherit one copy of the deleterious  to manifest the disease autosomal recessive diseases however require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers also known as s for the condition
autosomal  can also result in disease conditions aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus fetuses with aneuploidy of gene rich chromosomes—such as —never survive to term name 1  and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene poor chromosomes—such as — are still miscarried over 23% of the time  possessing a single copy of an autosome known as a monosomy is nearly always incompatible with life though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth having three copies of an autosome known as a trisomy is far more compatible with life however a common example is  which is caused by possessing three copies of  instead of the usual two name 1  
partial aneuploidy can also occur as a result of  during meiosis  deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial monosomies while duplications can cause partial trisomies if the duplication or deletion is large enough it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases ranging from  to    unlike single gene disorders diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper  not nonfunctional gene product

al qaedas management philosophy has been described as centralization of decision and decentralization of executional hammadi khalid the inside story of al qaida part 4 al quds al arabi march 22 2005  it is thought that al qaedas leadership following the  has become geographically isolated leading to the emergence of decentralized leadership of regional groups using the al qaeda brand  
many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al qaedas leadership although bin laden still held considerable ideological sway over some  before his death experts argue that al qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another  a psychiatrist and former central intelligence agency cia officer said that al qaeda is now just a loose label for a movement that seems to target the west there is no umbrella organisation we like to create a mythical entity called al qaeda in our minds but that is not the reality we are dealing with name ft threat 
this view mirrors the account given by osama bin laden in his october 2001 interview with 
blockquote this matter isnt about any specific person and is not about the al qaidah organization we are the children of an islamic nation with prophet muhammad as its leader our lord is one and all the true believers mumineen are brothers so the situation isnt like the west portrays it that there is an organization with a specific name such as al qaidah and so on that particular name is very old it was born without any intention from us brother abu ubaida created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious arrogant brutal terrorizing soviet empire so this place was called the base al qaidah as in a training base so this name grew and became we arent separated from this nation we are the children of a nation and we are an inseparable part of it and from those public  which spread from the far east from the philippines to indonesia to malaysia to india to pakistan reaching mauritania and so we discuss the conscience of this nation name islamicawakening  blockquote
others however see al qaeda as an integrated network that is strongly led from the pakistani tribal areas and has a powerful strategic purpose  a terrorism expert at  said it amazes me that people dont think there is a clear adversary out there and that our adversary does not have a strategic approach name ft threat

 in the late 1990s there was a publicly known media committee which ran the now defunct newspaper nashrat al akhbar newscast and handled 
 in 2005 al qaeda formed  a media production house to supply its video and audio materials
when asked about the possibility of al qaedas connection to the  in 2005   said al qaeda is not an organization al qaeda is a way of working but this has the hallmark of that approach al qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training to provide expertise and i think that is what has occurred here name foxnewsblair 
on august 13 2005 however  newspaper quoting police and  investigations reported that the july 7 bombers had acted independently of an al qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad 
what exactly al qaeda is or was remains in dispute certainly it has been obliged to evolve and adapt in the aftermath of 9 11 and the launch of the war on terror
nasser al bahri who was osama bin ladens bodyguard for four years in the run up to 9 11 gives a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time in his memoiral bahri nasser guarding bin laden my life in al qaeda p185 thin man press london isbn 9780956247360  he describes its formal administrative structure and vast arsenal as well as day to day life as a member
however author and journalist  argues that the idea of al qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an american invention curtis contends the name al qaeda was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin laden and the four men accused of the  in east africa
blockquotethe reality was that bin laden and ayman al zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy but there was no organization these were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin laden for funding and assistance he was not their commander there is also no evidence that bin laden used the term al qaeda to er to the name of a group until after september 11 attacks when he realized that this was the term the americans had given it name the power of nightmareshttps  archiveorg details thepowerofnightmares the power of nightmares bbc documentary  blockquote
as a matter of law the  needed to show that bin laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him  under the  also known as the rico statutes the name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of  who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin laden  questions about the reliability of al fadls testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty and because he was delivering it as part of a  agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack us military establishments name first informant   sam schmidt one of his defense lawyers said
blockquotethere were selective portions of al fadls testimony that i believe was false to help support the picture that he helped the americans join together i think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was it made al qaeda the new mafia or the new communists it made them identifiable as a group and theore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin laden name the power of nightmares  blockquote
the number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training and are capable of commanding insurgent forces is largely unknown documents captured in the raid on bin laden compound in 2011 show that the core al qaeda membership in 2002 was 170http  wwwtelegraphcouk news worldnews northamerica usa 9243503 secret osama bin laden files reveal al qaeda membershiphtml secret osama bin laden files reveal al qaeda membership the telegraph accessed 26 july 2013  in 2006 it was estimated that al qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries name cassidy   it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders 
according to the award winning 2004 bbc documentary  al qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin laden and a small clique of close associates the lack of any significant numbers of convicted al qaeda members despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al qaeda existed

# provoke the united states and the west into invading a muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on us soil that results in massive civilian casualties
# incite local resistance to occupying forces
# expand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the us and its allies in a long war of attrition
# convert al qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control and via these franchises incite attacks against the us and countries allied with the us until they withdraw from the conflict as happened with the  but which did not have the same effect with the 
# the us economy will finally collapse by the year 2020 under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places making the worldwide economic system which is dependent on the us also collapse leading to global political instability which in turn leads to a global jihad led by al qaeda and a   will then be installed across the world following the collapse of the us and the rest of the western world countries
atwan also noted regarding the collapse of the us if this sounds far fetched it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the  name atwan 
according to  a jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with al zarqawi al qaedas strategy plan consists of 7 phases and is similar to the plan described in al qaedas strategy to the year 2020 
# the awakening this phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003 the goal of the phase is to provoke the united states to attack a muslim country by executing an attack on us soil that kills many civilians
# opening eyes this phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006 the goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al qaeda group into a movement iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states
# arising and standing up was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010 in this phase al qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on syria hussein believed that other countries in the  were also in danger
# in the fourth phase al qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the arabian peninsula the main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and  targeting the us economy and military infrastructure
# the fifth phase is the declaration of an islamic caliphate which was projected between 2013 and 2016 in this phase al qaeda expected the resistance from israel to be heavily reduced
# the sixth phase is described as the declaration of an islamic army and a fight between believers and non believers also called total confrontation
# definitive victory the seventh and last phase is projected to be completed by 2020 the world will be beaten down by the islamic army according to the 7 phase strategy the war isnt projected to last longer than 2 years

bin laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with  journalist  in october 2001
blockquotethe name al qaeda was established a long time ago by mere chance the late  established the training camps for our  against russias terrorism we used to call the training camp al qaeda the name stayed  blockquote
it has been argued that two documents seized from the  office of the  prove that the name was not simply adopted by the mujahid movement and that a group called al qaeda was established in august 1988 both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group and contain the term al qaeda wright indirectly quotes one of the documents based on an exhibit from the tareek osama document presented in span class plainlinkshttp  fl1findlawcom newsfindlawcom hdocs docs bif usarnaout10603profpdf united states v enaam m arnaout span 
former british foreign secretary  wrote that the word al qaeda should be translated as the database and originally erred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with cia help to defeat the russians  in april 2002 the group assumed the name qaidat al jihad which means the base of jihad according to  this was apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of egypts  egyptian islamist jihad or eij group led by  with the groups bin laden brought under his control after his return to afghanistan in the mid 1990shttp  weeklyahramorgeg 2003 619 op13htm after mombassa  january 2–8 2003 issue no 619 retrieved september 3 2006 
the radical  movement in general and al qaeda in particular developed during the  and  of the last three decades of the 20th century along with less extreme movements the  against the pro soviet government december 1979 to february 1989 developed the  movement of which al qaeda was the most prominent example 
some have argued that without the writings of islamic author and thinker  al qaeda would not have existed  qutb preached that because of the lack of  law the muslim world was no longer muslim having reverted to pre islamic ignorance known as 
to restore islam he said a vanguard movement of righteous muslims was needed to establish true  implement sharia and rid the muslim world of any non muslim influences such as concepts like socialism and nationalism enemies of islam in qutbs view included treacherous orientalists  and world jewry who plotted conspiracies and wickedly opposed islam
in the words of  a close college friend of bin laden blockquoteislam is different from any other religion its a way of life we khalifa and bin laden were trying to understand what islam has to say about how we eat who we marry how we talk we read sayyid qutb he was the one who most affected our generation  blockquote
qutb had an even greater influence on bin ladens mentor and another leading member of al qaeda  ayman al zawahiri zawahiris uncle and maternal family patriarch mafouz azzam was qutbs student then protégé then personal lawyer and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see qutb before his execution young ayman al zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle mahfouz about the purity of qutbs character and the torment he had endured in prisonmafouz azzam cited in   zawahiri paid homage to qutb in his work knights under the prophets banner 
one of the most powerful of qutbs ideas was that many who said they were muslims were not rather they were s that not only gave jihadists a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another muslim but made it a religious obligation to execute these self professed muslims these alleged apostates included leaders of muslim countries since they failed to enforce sharia law 
 writes that
 has described five distinct phases in the development of al qaeda beginnings in the late 1980s a wilderness period in 1990–96 its heyday in 1996–2001 a network period from 2001 to 2005 and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to today 
the origins of al qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the  december 1979 – february 1989 name cooley  the us viewed the conflict in afghanistan with the afghan s and allied soviet troops on one side and the native afghan mujahideen some of whom were radical islamic militants on the other as a blatant case of soviet expansionism and aggression a cia program called  channeled funds through pakistans  agency to the afghan mujahideen who were fighting the soviet occupation name 1986 1992 cia and british recruit and train militants worldwide to help fight afghan war 
at the same time a growing number of arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the  facilitated by international muslim organizations particularly the  name maktab al khidamat globalsecurity  which was funded by the saudi arabia government as well as by individual muslims particularly saudi businessmen who were approached by bin laden together these sources donated some 600ampnbspmillion a year to jihad 
in 1984  mak or the services office a muslim organization founded to raise and channel funds and recruit foreign mujahideen for the war against the soviets in afghanistan was established in peshawar pakistan by bin laden and  a palestinian islamic scholar and member of the  mak organized  in peshawar near the afghan border and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the afghan war front bin laden became a major financier of the mujahideen spending his own money and using his connections with the saudi royal family and the petro billionaires of the gulf to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds quotes taken from  and  
from 1986 mak began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the us the hub of which was the  at the farouq mosque on s atlantic avenue among notable figures at the brooklyn center were double agent  whom fbi special agent jack cloonan called bin ladens first trainerhttp  wwwpbsorg wgbh pages frontline      torture interviews cloonanhtml cloonan frontline interview pbs july 13 2005  and blind sheikh  a leading recruiter of mujahideen for afghanistan al qaeda evolved from mak

the soviet union finally withdrew from afghanistan in 1989 to the surprise of many s communist afghan government hung on for three more years before being overrun by elements of the mujahideen with mujahideen leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance chaos ensued with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill defined territories leaving the country devastated
toward the end of the  mission in afghanistan some mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include islamist struggles in other parts of the world such as israel and  a number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed to further those aspirations
one of these was the organization that would eventually be called al qaeda formed by bin laden with an initial meeting held on august 11 1988 name guardianobserverhistory  name the osama bin laden i know 
notes of a meeting of bin laden and others on august 20 1988 indicate al qaeda was a formal group by that time basically an organized islamic faction its goal is to lift the word of god to make his religion victorious a list of requirements for membership itemized the following listening ability good manners obedience and making a pledge  to follow ones superiors

according to wright the groups real name wasnt used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret  his research suggests that al qaeda was formed at an august 11 1988 meeting between several senior leaders of egyptian islamic jihad  and bin laden where it was agreed to join bin ladens money with the expertise of the islamic jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the soviets withdrew from afghanistan name rebellionwright 
bin laden wished to establish non military operations in other parts of the world azzam in contrast wanted to remain focused on military campaigns after azzam was assassinated in 1989 the mak split with a significant number joining bin ladens organization
in november 1989  a former special forces sergeant stationed at  north carolina left military service and moved to california he traveled to afghanistan and pakistan and became deeply involved with bin ladens plans 
a year later on november 8 1990 the fbi raided the new jersey home of ali mohammeds associate  discovering a great deal of evidence of terrorist plots including plans to blow up new york city skyscrapers  nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993  in 1991 ali mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin ladens relocation to sudan 
following the soviet unions withdrawal from afghanistan in february 1989 bin laden returned to saudi arabia the  in august 1990 had put the kingdom and its ruling  at risk the worlds most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of iraqi forces in kuwait and saddams call to pan arab islamism could potentially rally internal dissent
in the face of a seemingly massive iraqi military presence saudi arabias own forces were well armed but far outnumbered bin laden offered the services of his mujahideen to  to protect saudi arabia from the iraqi army the saudi monarch used bin ladens offer opting instead to allow us and allied forces to deploy troops into saudi territory 
the deployment angered bin laden as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the land of the two mosques  and  profaned sacred soil after speaking publicly against the saudi government for harboring american troops he was banished and forced to live in exile in sudan
from around 1992 to 1996 al qaeda and bin laden based themselves in sudan at the invitation of islamist theoretician  the move followed an islamist coup détat in sudan led by colonel  who professed a commitment to reordering muslim political values during this time bin laden assisted the sudanese government bought or set up various business enterprises and established camps where insurgents trained
a key turning point for bin laden further pitting him against the sauds occurred in 1993 when saudi arabia gave support for the  which set a path for peace between israel and  
zawahiri and the eij who served as the core of al qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the egyptian government had bad luck in sudan in 1993 a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful eij attempt on the life of the egyptian prime minister  egyptian public opinion turned against islamist bombings and the police arrested 280 of al jihads members and executed 6 
due to bin ladens continuous verbal assault on king fahd of saudi arabia on march 5 1994 fahd sent an emissary to sudan demanding bin ladens passport bin ladens saudi citizenship was also revoked his family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend 7ampnbspmillion  today a year and his saudi assets were frozen  name osama bin laden a chronology of his political life  his family publicly disowned him there is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and or the saudi government name context of shortlly after april 1994 
in june 1995 an even more ill fated  led to the expulsion of eij and in may 1996 of bin laden by the sudanese government

after the soviet withdrawal afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various mujahideen groups
throughout the 1990s a new force began to emerge the origins of the  literally students lay in the children of afghanistan many of them orphaned by the war and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of islamic schools s either in  or in the ugee camps on the afghan pakistani border

many of the mujahideen who later joined the taliban fought alongside afghan warlord s harkat i inqilabi group at the time of the russian invasion this group also enjoyed the loyalty of most afghan arab fighters
the continuing internecine strife between various factions and accompanying lawlessness following the soviet withdrawal enabled the growing and well disciplined taliban to expand their control over territory in afghanistan and it came to establish an enclave which it called the  in 1994 it captured the regional center of kandahar and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter conquered the capital city  in september 1996
after the sudanese made it clear in may 1996 that bin laden would never be welcome to return taliban controlled afghanistan—with previously established connections between the groups administered with a shared militancy  and largely isolated from american political influence and military power—provided a perfect location for al qaeda to relocate its headquarters al qaeda enjoyed the talibans protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their ministry of defense although only pakistan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates recognized the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan
while in afghanistan the taliban government tasked al qaeda with the training of  an elite part of the talibans army from 1997–2001 the brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters many veterans from the soviet invasion and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen in november 2001 as  had toppled the taliban government many brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed and those that survived were thought to head into pakistan along with bin laden

around 1994 the salafi groups waging  in bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline as they grew less and less aggressive groups such as eij began to drift away from the salafi cause in europe al qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist  in bosnia in late 1995
at the same time al qaeda ideologues instructed the networks recruiters to look for  muslims who believed that extremist jihad must be fought on a global level the concept of a global salafi jihad had been around since at least the early 1980s several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non muslims out of every muslim land at the same time and with maximum carnage this was however a fundamentally defensive strategy
al qaeda sought to open the offensive phase of the global salafi jihad  bosnian islamists in 2006 called for solidarity with islamic causes around the world supporting the insurgents in kashmir and iraq as well as the groups fighting for a palestinian state 
in 1996 al qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered islamic lands bin laden issued a fatwa binding religious edict  which amounted to a public declaration of war against the us and its allies and began to ocus al qaedas resources on large scale propagandist strikes
on february 23 1998 bin laden and ayman al zawahiri a leader of egyptian islamic jihad along with three other islamist leaders co signed and issued a fatwa calling on muslims to kill americans and their allies where they can when they cansummary taken from bin ladens may 26 1998 interview with american journalist  most recently broadcast in the documentary age of terror part 4 with translations checked by barry purkis archive researcher  under the banner of the  they declared

neither bin laden nor al zawahiri possessed the traditional islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa however they rejected the authority of the contemporary  which they saw as the paid servants of  rulers and took it upon themselves by issuing fatwas bin laden and his followers are acting out a kind of self appointment as alim they are asserting their rights as interpreters of islamic law  former russian  agent  who was later killed said that the fsb trained al zawahiri in a camp in  eight months before the 1998 fatwa

al qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks four of them in its jihad against america in each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities
al qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks and very rarely makes wire transfers 
on december 29 1992 al qaedas first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in  yemen the first target was the movenpick hotel and the second was the parking lot of the goldmohur hotel
the bombings were an attempt to eliminate american soldiers on their way to somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort  internally al qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the americans away but in the us the attack was barely noticed
no americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether and they went on to somalia as scheduled however two people were killed in the bombing an australian tourist and a yemeni hotel worker seven others mostly yemenis were severely injured name wright174  two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al qaedas members  to justify the killings according to islamic law salim erred to a famous fatwa appointed by  a 13th century scholar much admired by wahhabis which sanctioned resistance by any means during the mongol invasions

messages issued by bin laden after september 11 2001 praised the attacks and explained their motivation while denying any involvement  bin laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and islamist muslims such as the general perception that the us was actively oppressing muslims 
bin laden asserted that america was massacring muslims in    and iraq and that muslims should retain the right to attack in reprisal he also claimed the 9 11 attacks were not targeted at people but americas icons of military and economic power despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning where most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating massive amount of human casualtieshamid miir osama claims he has nukes if us uses n arms it will get the same response dawn the internet edition november 10 2001

in december 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin laden was posted directly to a website rather than sending a copy to  as he had done in the past
al qaeda turned to the internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited rather than risk the possibility of al jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the   bin ladens december 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech lasting over an hour

bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local afghans willing to fight  that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for american funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non american muslim sources that americans could not have trained mujahideen because pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in pakistan and none in afghanistan and that the afghan arabs were almost invariably militant islamists lexively hostile to westerners whether or not the westerners were helping the muslim afghans
according to bergen known for conducting the first television interview with bin laden in 1997 the idea that the cia funded bin laden or trained bin laden is a folk myth theres no evidence of this bin laden had his own money he was anti american and he was operating secretly and independently the real story here is the cia didnt really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him  but bergen conceded that in one strange incident the cia appeared to give visa help to mujahideen recruiter

alessandro volta also drew admiration from  for his invention and was invited to the  to demonstrate his invention to the members of the institute volta enjoyed a certain amount of closeness with the emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him name archivebook  alessandro volta held the chair of experimental physics at the  for nearly 40 years and was widely idolised by his students name archivebook 
despite his professional success volta tended to be a person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years at this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in 1827 from a series of illnesses which began in 1823 name archivebook  the  unit of  is named in his honour as the 
volta was born in  a town in present day northern  near the  border on 18 february 1745 in 1794 volta married an aristocratic lady also from como teresa peregrini with whom he raised three sons zanino flaminio and luigi his own father filippo volta was of noble lineage his mother donna maddalena came from the family of the inzaghis name alessandrovoltainfo_february_18_2015c 
in 1774 he became a professor of physics at the royal school in como a year later he improved and popularised the  a device that produced  his promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the swedish experimenter  p73 joh carl wilcke 1762 ytterligare rön och försök om contraira electriciteterne vid laddningen och därtil hörande delar additional findings and experiments on the opposing electric charges that are created during charging and parts related thereto kongliga svenska vetenskaps academiens handlingar proceedings of the royal swedish science academy vol 23 pages https  booksgooglecom booksid hhrjaaaacaajamplpg pa210ampots z7ronaculsamppg pa202#v onepageampqampf false 206 229 245–266  in 1777 he travelled through switzerland there he befriended

volta also studied what we now call electrical  developing separate means to study both electrical potential v  and charge q  and discovering that for a given object they are proportional name williams2014  this is called voltas law of capacitance and it was for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the  name williams2014 
in 1779 he became a professor of experimental physics at the  a chair that he occupied for almost 40 years name archivebook 
 an italian physicist discovered something he named animal electricity when two different metals were connected in series with a frogs leg and to one another volta realised that the frogs leg served as both a conductor of electricity what we would now call an  and as a detector of electricity he replaced the frogs leg with brine soaked paper and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies
in this way he discovered the  and the law that the  emf of a  consisting of a pair of metal s separated by electrolyte is the difference between their two electrode potentials thus two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf this may be called voltas law of the electrochemical series
in 1800 as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by galvani volta invented the  an early  which produced a steady electric current name routledge  volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was  and  initially he experimented with individual cells in series each cell being a wine goblet filled with  into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped the voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine
in announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile volta paid tribute to the influences of   and  
the battery made by volta is credited as the first electrochemical cell it consists of two electrodes one made of  the other of  the  is either  mixed with water or a form of saltwater  the electrolyte exists in the form 2hsup+ sup and sosub4 subsup2− sup the zinc which is higher in the  than both copper and hydrogen reacts with the negatively charged sulfate sosub4 subsup2− sup the positively charged hydrogen ions s capture s from the copper forming bubbles of hydrogen gas hsub2 sub this makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode
thus there are two terminals and an  will flow if they are connected the s in this voltaic cell are as follows
zinc
zn bigbig→ big big znsup2+ sup + 2esup− sup
sulfuric acid
2hsup+ sup + 2esup− sup bigbig→ big big hsub2 sub
the copper does not react but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current
however this cell also has some disadvantages it is unsafe to handle since sulfuric acid even if diluted can be hazardous also the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released instead it accumulates on the surface of the zinc electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution
in 1809 volta became associated member of the   in honour of his work volta was made a count by  in 1810 name   wmnqsy 
volta retired in 1819 to his estate in camnago a  of  now named camnago volta in his honour he died there on 5 march 1827 just after his 82nd birthday  voltas remains were buried in camnago voltafor a photograph of his gravesite and other volta locales see   
voltas legacy is celebrated by the  memorial located in the public gardens by the lake there is also a museum which has been built in his honour which exhibits some of the equipment that volta used to conduct experiments nearby stands the  which houses the voltian foundation an organization promoting scientific activities volta carried out his experimental studies and produced his first inventions near como
his image was depicted on the  1990 1997 along with a sketch of his voltaic pile
volta was raised as a catholic and for all of his life continued to maintain his belief  because he was not ordained a clergyman as his family expected he was sometimes accused of being irreligious and some people have speculated about his possible unbelief stressing that he did not join the churchadam hart davis 2012 engineers penguin p 138  or that he virtually ignored the churchs callmichael brian schiffer 2003 draw the lightning down benjamin franklin and electrical technology in the age of enlightenment university of california press p 55   nevertheless he cast out doubts in a declaration of faith in which he said

argo navis the ship argo or simply argo was a large  in the southern sky that has since been divided into three constellations it represented the  the ship used by  and the  in   the genitive was argus navis abbreviated arg   and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just navis the ship genitive navis abbreviated nav
due to  the stars of argo have been shifted farther south since classical times and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitude of the mediterranean 
the original constellation was found low near the southern horizon of the mediterranean sky the ship became visible in springtime and sailed westward skimming along the southern horizon the ancient greeks identified it with the ship sailed by jason and the argonauts in search of the golden fleece
argo navis is the only one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer  that is no longer officially recognized as a constellation it was unwieldy due to its enormous size in 1752 the french astronomer  subdivided it into  the  or the hull of the ship  the  or  and  the s lacaille replaced bayers  with new ones but like bayer he used a single greek letter sequence for the three parts carina has α β and ε vela has γ and δ puppis has ζ and so on name wagmanmorton wagman lost stars mcdonald and woodward 2003 isbn 0 939923 78 5  for the dimmer stars however lacaille used a separate latin letter sequence for each part name wagman   the duplication of omicron in vela and puppis appears to contradict this but omicron puppis is an error for lacailles o puppis latin oh name wagman  
the constellation  the  occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of argos mast some authors state that pyxis was part of the greek conception of argo navisjohn scalzi 2008 rough guide to the universe p 240 isbn 9781405383707 david h kelley et al 2011 exploring ancient skies a survey of ancient and cultural astronomy p 12 9781441976246 emily winterburn 2009 the stargazers guide p 124 isbn 9780061976377  but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient greek times lacaille considered it a separate constellation representing one of the modern scientific instruments he placed among the constellations like  and  in the notes to his preliminary catalogue published in 1756 lacaille wrote “i have divided argo into three parts namely la pouppe puppis le corps carina amp la voilure vela”lacaille n histoire de lacadémie royale des sciences 1752 published 1756 p 590  pyxis was listed separately among his 14 new constellations lacaille assigned bayer designations to pyxis separate from those of carina puppis and vela and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of argo name wagman    in 1844 john herschel suggested formalizing the mast as a new constellation  to replace lacailles pyxis but the idea did not catch on

her name is the  form of the greek  androméda or  andromédē ruler of menthe traditional  of the name is she who has bravery in her mind  from  anēr andrós man and medon ruler
as a subject andromeda has been popular in art since classical times it is one of several greek myths of a s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic  sacred marriage giving rise to the   from the  interest revived in the original story typically as derived from s account
in  andromeda was the daughter of  and  king and queen of the north african kingdom of 
her mother cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the  the  daughters of the sea god  and often seen accompanying  to punish the queen for her arrogance poseidon brother to  and god of the sea sent a sea monster named  to ravage the coast of aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen the desperate king consulted the  of apollo who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter andromeda to the monster stripped naked she was chained to a rock on the coast
 was returning from having slain the   after he happened upon the chained andromeda he approached cetus while invisible for he was wearing hadess helm and killed the sea monster he set andromeda free and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle  at the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals and phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the gorgons head  v 1 
andromeda followed her husband first to his native island of  where he rescued his mother  and then to  in  together they became the ancestors of the family of the perseidae through the line of their son perses perseus and andromeda had seven sons       and  as well as two daughters  and  their descendants ruled mycenae from  down to  after whom  attained the kingdom and would also include the great hero  according to this mythology perseus is the ancestor of the 
at the port city of  today part of  an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of andromedas chaining and rescue by the traveler  the geographer  and the historian of the jews pausanias iv359 strabo xvi28 josephus jewish war iii93 
after andromedas death as  had promised  at the end of his  produced in 412 bce the heroes of the greeks 195953 euripides drama is lost save some fragments  the goddess placed her among the s in the northern sky near perseus and  the  so known since antiquity is named after her
andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the   which contains the 
four constellations are associated with the myth viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye the constellations are rendered as
 a huge man wearing a  upside down with respect to the  the constellation 
 a smaller figure next to the man sitting on a chair as it is near the  it may be seen by observers in the northern hemisphere through the whole year although sometimes upside down the constellation 
 a maiden chained up facing or turning away from the ecliptic the constellation  next to 
 a  just under the ecliptic the constellation 
other constellations related to the story are
 
 the constellation  who was born from the stump of s neck after perseus had decapitated her
 the constellation  which may have been treated as two fish caught by  the  who was brother of  king of  the place where perseus and his mother  were stranded
 and  and in more modern times  made the story the subject of  and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art including greek vases s opera  also dramatizes the myth
andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art which typically show the moment of rescue with andromeda usually still chained and often naked or nearly so examples include one of s poesies  and compositions by    rennes   and  from the  onward the chained nude figure of andromeda typically was the centre of interest  s  is unusual in showing her alone fearfully awaiting the monster
the italian composer  composed an hour long operatic drama called perseo e andromeda in 2000
in 1973 an animated film called perseus 20 minutes was made in the  as part of the soviet animated film collection called legends and mуths of ancient greece  
the 1981 film  retells the story of perseus andromeda and cassiopeia but makes a few changes notably cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than  as opposed to the nereids as a group thetis was indeed a nereid and also the future mother of  andromeda and perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of thetis son calibos whereas in the myth they simply meet as perseus returns home from having slain  in the film the monster is called a  although it is depicted as a lizard like creature rather than a squid and combining two elements of the myth perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it medusas face turning the monster into stone andromeda is depicted as being strong willed and independent whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom perseus saves from the sea monster andromeda was portrayed by  in this film
andromeda also features in the 2010 film  a remake of the 1981 version several changes were made in regard to the myth most notably that perseus did not marry andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster andromeda was portrayed by  the character was played by  in the sequel  the second of a planned  in the end of the sequel perseus and andromeda begin a relationship
in the japanese anime  the character  represents the  using chains as his main weapons reminiscent of andromeda being chained before she was saved by perseus in order to attain the andromeda cloth he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him also reminiscent of this myth
andromeda appears in s  as a new student of prometheus academy which hercules and other characters from greek mythology attend 
in s  series there are a few erences to andromeda the most obvious is that the series lead villains have a  which serves as their headquarters and is called the princess andromeda
andromeda is the main character in s short story miss manners guide to greek missology published in s chicks in chainmail series of humorous feminist fantasy collections and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards it is a satire filled with role reversals puns and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture

antlia  from  ἀντλία is a  in the southern sky its name means  and it specifically represents an air pump the constellation was created in the 18th century from an undesignated region of sky so the stars comprising antlia are faint the brightest star is  is an orange  that is a suspected  ranging between s 422 and 429  a  and the  lie within antlias borders
the french astronomer   first described the constellation in french as la machine pneumatique the pneumatic pump in 1751–52 name ridpathlac   commemorating the  invented by the french physicist  name startales  he had observed and catalogued almost 10000 southern stars during a two year stay at the  devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the  not visible from europe all but one honoured instruments that symbolised the  lacaille latinised the name to antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart john herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word which was universally taken up
though antlia was technically visible to ancient greek astronomers its stars were too faint to have been included in any constellations name startales  because of this its main stars have no particular pattern and it is devoid of bright deep sky objects name moore 
lacaille and  each depicted antlia differently as either the single cylinder vacuum pump used in papins initial experiments or the more advanced double cylinder version name startales  the  subsequently adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations there is no mythology attached to antlia as lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose names mostly from scientific instruments name startales 
according to some the most prominent stars that now comprise antlia were once included within the ancient constellation  the ship of the argonauts which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by lacaille in 1763peter birren 2002 objects in the heavens pp 9 45 isbn 155369662x thomas william webb dover publications 1962 celestial objects for common telescopes volume 2 p 36  however given the faintness and obscurity of its stars most authorities do not believe that the ancient greeks included antlia as part of their classical depiction of argo navisian ridpath 2002 stars and planets pp 65 122 isbn 0 7894 8988 0 
chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern antlia from their latitudes and incorporated its stars into two different constellations several stars in the southern part of antlia were a portion of dongou which represented an area in southern china name startales  furthermore   and  were incorporated into the celestial temple which also contained stars from modern  name startales

sir alexander fleming  name frs  6 august 188111 march 1955 was a scottish   and  his best known discoveries are the   in 1923 and the  substance benzylpenicillin penicillin g from the mould  in 1928 for which he shared the  in 1945 with  and  name lesprixnobel      name natureobit  he wrote many articles on bacteriology immunology and chemotherapy
fleming was born on 6 august  1881 at lochfield farm near  in  scotland he was the third of the four children of farmer hugh fleming 1816–1888 from his second marriage to grace stirling morton 1848–1928 the daughter of a neighbouring farmer hugh fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage he was 59 at the time of his second marriage and died when alexander known as alex was seven
fleming went to  and darvel school and earned a two year scholarship to  before moving to london where he attended the  name penicillin man  after working in a shipping office for four years the twenty year old fleming inherited some money from an uncle john fleming his elder brother tom was already a physician and suggested to his younger sibling that he should follow the same career and so in 1903 the younger alexander enrolled at  in  he qualified with an  degree from the school with distinction in 1906
fleming had been a private in the  of the  since 1900 name lesprixnobel   and had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school the captain of the club wishing to retain fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at st marys where he became assistant bacteriologist to sir  a pioneer in  therapy and immunology in 1908 he gained a  degree with gold medal in  and became a lecturer at st marys until 1914
fleming served throughout  as a captain in the  and was  he and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the  in france in 1918 he returned to  where he was elected professor of bacteriology of the  in 1928 in 1951 he was elected the rector of the  for a term of 3 years
following world war i fleming actively searched for anti bacterial agents having witnessed the death of many soldiers from  resulting from infected   killed the patients immunological defences more effectively than they killed the invading bacteria in an article he submitted for the medical journal  during world war i fleming described an ingenious experiment which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during world war i antiseptics worked well on the surface but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach sir  strongly supported flemings findings but despite this most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients

at st mary’s hospital fleming continued his investigations into antibacterial substances  testing the nasal secretions from a patient with a heavy cold he found that nasal mucus had an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth   this was the first recorded discovery of  an enzyme present in many secretions including tears saliva human milk as well as mucus  lysozyme degrades the bonds in bacterial peptidoglycan cell walls particularly in gram positive organisms  unfortunately lysozyme had little therapeutic potential
when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 1928 i certainly didnt plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the worlds first antibiotic or bacteria killer fleming would later say but i suppose that was exactly what i did name isbn1 56308 159 8 
by 1927 fleming had been investigating the properties of  he was already well known from his earlier work and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher but his laboratory was often untidy on 3 september 1928 fleming returned to his laboratory having spent august on holiday with his family before leaving he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory on returning fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal famously remarking thats funny name brownbrown k 2004 penicillin man alexander fleming and the antibiotic revolution 320 pp sutton publishing isbn 0 7509 3152 3  fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant merlin price who reminded him thats how you discovered hare r the birth of penicillin allen amp unwin london 1970  fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease causing bacteria he identified the mould as being from the  genus and after some months of calling it mould juice named the substance it released  on 7 march 1929diggins f the true history of the discovery of penicillin by alexander fleming biomedical scientist march 2003 insititute of biomedical sciences london originally published in the imperial college school of medicine gazette  the laboratory in which fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the  in st marys hospital 
he investigated its positive anti bacterial effect on many organisms and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other  pathogens that cause    and  but not  or  which are caused by  bacteria for which he was seeking a cure at the time it also affected  which causes  although this bacterium is gram negative
fleming published his discovery in 1929 in the british journal of experimental pathology name pmid6994200  but little attention was paid to his article fleming continued his investigations but found that cultivating penicillium was quite difficult and that after having grown the mould it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent flemings impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity and because its action appeared to be rather slow penicillin would not be important in treating infection fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body in vivo to kill bacteria effectively many clinical tests were inconclusive probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic in the 1930s fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise   and he continued until 1940 to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further ine usable penicillin fleming finally abandoned penicillin and not long after he did  and  at the  in oxford took up researching and mass producing it with funds from the us and british governments they started mass production after the bombing of  by  in 1944 enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded with the 
in oxford  and  discovered how to isolate and concentrate penicillin abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillinin october 1943 abraham proposed a molecular structure which included a cyclic formation containing three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom the β lactam ring not then known in natural products this structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy and was initially strongly disputed by sir robert robinson among others but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin using x ray analysis oxford dictionary of national biography abraham sir edward penley   shortly after the team published its first results in 1940 fleming telephoned  chains head of department to say that he would be visiting within the next few days when chain heard that fleming was coming he remarked good god i thought he was dead
 suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity this produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals there were many more people involved in the oxford team and at one point the entire dunn school was involved in its production
after the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940 several clinical trials ensued and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945
fleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin describing his fame as the fleming myth and he praised florey and chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance giving him the privilege of naming it penicillin he also kept grew and distributed the original mould for twelve years and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin but sir  said in 1998 without fleming no chain without chain no florey without florey no heatley without heatley no penicillinhenry harris howard florey and the development of penicillin a lecture given on 29 september 1998 at the florey centenary 1898–1998 sir william dunn school of pathology oxford university sound recording http  cataloguenlagovau record 1610017

the popular storyeg philadelphia enquirer 17 july 1945 brown penicillin man note 43 to chapter 2  of  paying for flemings education after flemings father saved young  from death is false according to the biography penicillin man alexander fleming and the antibiotic revolution by  alexander fleming in a letter14 november 1945 british library additional manuscripts 56115 brown penicillin man note 44 to chapter 2  to his friend and colleague andre gratiasee wikipedia  article entry for 1920  described this as a wondrous fable nor did he save winston churchill himself during  churchill was saved by  using  since he had no experience with penicillin when churchill fell ill in  in  in 1943  and  on 21 december 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin he was saved by the new sulphonamide drug  known at the time under the research code mampb 693 discovered and produced by    – a subsidiary of the french group  in a subsequent  churchill erred to the new drug as this admirable mampba history of may amp baker 1834–1984 alden press 1984  it is highly probable that the correct information about the  did not reach the newspapers because since the original sulphonamide antibacterial  had been a discovery by the german laboratory  and as britain was at war with  at the time it was thought better to raise british morale by associating churchills cure with a british discovery penicillin

in 1850 carnegie became a telegraph messenger boy in the pittsburgh office of the ohio telegraph company at 250 per week p 37  following the recommendation of his uncle
he was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of pittsburghs businesses and the faces of important men he made many connections this way he also paid close attention to his work and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced he developed the ability to translate signals by ear without using the paper slip pp 56 59  and within a year was promoted to operator carnegies education and passion for reading was given a great boost by colonel james anderson who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each saturday night p 45  carnegie was a consistent borrower and a self made man in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development he was so grateful to colonel anderson for the use of his library that he resolved if ever wealth came to me to see to it that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man   his capacity his willingness for hard work his perseverance and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities
starting in 1853  of the  employed carnegie as a secretary telegraph operator at a salary of 400 per week carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company name nasaw   at age 18 the precocious youth began a rapid advance through the company becoming the superintendent of the pittsburgh division his employment by the pennsylvania railroad company would be vital to his later success the railroads were the first big businesses in america and the pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years and from scott in particular name nasaw pp 54–59 64–65 
scott also helped him with his first investments many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by scott and the pennsylvanias president  which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with or payoffs made by contracting parties as part of a  name nasaw_pg59_60 pp 59–60  in 1855 scott made it possible for carnegie to invest 500 in the  which contracted with the pennsylvania to carry its messengers the money was secured by his mothers placing a 600 mortgage on the familys 700 home but the opportunity was available only because of carnegies close relationship with scott name nasaw_pg59_60  p 79  a few years later he received a few shares in s sleeping car company as a reward for holding shares that woodruff had given to scott and thomson as a payoff reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad related industries iron bridges and  carnegie slowly accumulated capital the basis for his later success throughout his later career he made use of his close connections to thomson and scott as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad offering the two men a stake in his enterprises
before the  carnegie arranged a merger between woodruffs company and that of  the inventor of a  for  which facilitated business travel at distances over  the investment proved a great success and a source of profit for woodruff and carnegie the young carnegie continued to work for the pennsylvanias tom scott and introduced several improvements in the service
in spring 1861 carnegie was appointed by scott who was now assistant secretary of war in charge of military transportation as superintendent of the military railways and the union governments telegraph lines in the east carnegie helped open the rail lines into washington dc that the rebels had cut he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of union troops to reach washington dc following the defeat of union forces at  he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces under his organization the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory carnegie later joked that he was the first casualty of the war when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire
defeat of the confederacy required vast supplies of s as well as railroads and telegraph lines to deliver the goods the war demonstrated how integral the industries were to american success

on the matter of american colonial expansion carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the united states he did not oppose the annexation of the hawaiian islands or puerto rico but he opposed the annexation of the philippines carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle and he also urged  to withdraw american troops and allow the filipinos to live with their independencecarnegie americanism versus imperialism esp pp 12–13  this act strongly impressed the other american anti imperialists who soon elected him vice president of the anti imperialist league
after he sold his steel company in 1901 carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause both financially and personally he gave away much of his fortunes to various peace keeping agencies in order to keep them growing when his friend the british writer  asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society his reply was
carnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people that maintains the peace in international relations money is just a push for the act if world peace depended solely on financial support it would not seem a goal but more like an act of pity
like stead he believed that the united states and the british empire would merge into one nation telling him we are heading straight to the re united states carnegie believed that the combined countrys power would maintain world peace and disarmament name stead1901  the creation of the  in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war beyond a gift of 10 million for peace promotion carnegie also encouraged the scientific investigation of the various causes of war and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them he believed that the endowment exists to promote information on the nations rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law 
in 1914 on the eve of the first world war carnegie founded the church peace union cpu a group of leaders in religion academia and politics through the cpu carnegie hoped to mobilize the worlds churches religious organizations and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever for its inaugural international event the cpu sponsored a conference to be held on august 1 1914 on the shores of lake constance in southern germany as the delegates made their way to the conference by train germany was invading belgium
despite its inauspicious beginning the cpu thrived today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the  an independent nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs
the outbreak of the first world war was clearly a shock to carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace although his promotion of  and world peace had all failed and the carnegie endowment had not fulfilled his expectations his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the  after his death which took world peace to another level

approximants are  that involve the  approaching each other but not narrowly enough  nor with enough articulatory precision citing   to create turbulent airflow theore approximants fall between  which do produce a turbulent airstream and s which produce no turbulence name martínez celdrán 2004 201  this class of sounds includes  approximants like  as in less non lateral approximants like  as in rest and  like  and  as in yes and west respectively name martínez celdrán 2004 201 
before  coined the term approximant in the 1960s pointing to   the term frictionless continuant erred to non lateral approximants
some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms  and glide are often used for these non syllabic vowel like segments the correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels citing  
vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment or for grammatical reasons as is the case with  similarly languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel citing   a number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable although he uses the terms interchangeably  remarks that for example the final glides of english par and buy differ from french par through and baille tub in that in the latter pair the approximants appear in the  whereas in the former they appear in the  this means that opaque if not minimal contrasts can occur in languages like  with the i like sound of piede foot appearing in the nucleus  and that of piano slow appearing in the syllable onset   and spanish with a near minimal pair being abyecto  abject and abierto  opened

 because of the articulatory complexities of the american english rhotic there is some variation in its phonetic description a transcription with the ipa character for an   is common though the sound is more  actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound citing   and   however  makes a distinction between the vowels of american english which he calls rhotacized and vowels with retroflexion such as those that appear in   on the other hand labels both as  and notes that both have a lowered third both cited in  
 because the vowels  are articulated with spread lips spreading is implied for their approximant analogues   however these sounds generally have little or no lip spreading the fricative letters with a lowering diacritic  may theore be justified for a neutral articulation between spread  and rounded  john esling 2010 phonetic notation in hardcastle laver amp gibbon eds the handbook of phonetic sciences 2nd ed p 699 
in articulation and often diachronically  approximants correspond to s  approximants to s and labialized approximants to s in american english the  approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel this can create alternations as shown in the above table
in addition to alternations glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to a hiatus  for example in  medial  triggers the formation of an inserted  that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix  is added to футбол football to make футболіст football player it is pronounced  but маоїст  with the same affix is pronounced  with a glide   has a similar process that extends to mid vowels 
 bioscoop →  cinema
 zee + en →  seas
 fluor →  fluor
 reu + en →  male dogs
 rwanda →   name dutchthere is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of  for speakers who realize it as   postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of  from glide insertion into  
 boaz →   name dutch 
similarly vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments  describes this behaviour for 
non high semivowels also occur in colloquial  speech a process of glide formation occurs where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non syllabic the process includes mid vowels so that  cause to wish features a non syllabic mid vowel  spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic  can occur so that ahorita right away is pronounced   it is not often clear however whether such sequences involve a semivowel a consonant or a diphthong a vowel and in many cases it may not be a meaningful distinction
although many languages have s  which lie between back velar  and front palatal  there are few cases of a corresponding approximant  one is in the korean diphthong  or https  pantherfileuwmedu iverson www kordiphpdf ahn amp iverson 2006  though it is more frequently analyzed as velar as in the table above and  may be another with three high vowel sounds    and three corresponding consonants  and  and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and  that is parallel to – and – an example is liq   whitelisten to a http  wwwlogosdictionaryorg sound mp 5119539_nwav recording 
in addition to less turbulence approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them  
when emphasized approximants may be slightly fricated that is the airstream may become slightly turbulent which is reminiscent of fricatives for example the  word ayuda help features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech  spanish can be analyzed as having a meaningful distinction between fricative approximant and intermediate martínez celdrán e 2004 problems in the classification of approximants journal of the international phonetic association 34 201–10  however such frication is generally slight and intermittent unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants 
because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs the increased air flow creates more turbulence making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants which are extremely rare cross linguistically  and voiceless fricatives difficult  this is why for example the voiceless labialized velar approximant  also transcribed with the special letter  has traditionally been labeled a fricative and no language is known to contrast it with a voiceless labialized velar fricative  name ladefoged 1996 326  similarly  has a voiceless  approximant  and  has a voiceless lateral fricative  but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages  again no language is known to contrast the two name ladefoged 1996 326    is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants with 
for places of articulation further back in the mouth languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants theore the ipa allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants with or without a lowering
