being the first man to go over to islam abu bakr had brought upon himself the special anger and hatred of the meccan chiefs soon he felt hard pressed and asked permission of muhammad to go to  the permission was granted and abu bakr set off on his journey however on the way he met ibn al daghinna the chief of  under ibn al daghinnas protection he soon came back to meccaprof fazl ahmed hazrat abu bakr new delhi idara ishaat e diniyat p15 isbn 8171010016

after staying at the cave for three days and three nights abu bakr and muhammad proceed to  staying for some time at quba a suburb of medina while  sources portray abu bakr in an exalted light in the cave  sources however generally tend to portray the incident in the cave as a quranic condemnation of abu bakr for cowardice and fearabu bakr al mundhir amputation and the art of ijtihadscott c lucaspg351 368j middle east stud392007351 368printed in us

khaarij ah bin zaid ansari used to live at sunh a suburb of medina and abu bakr also settled there after abu bakrs family arrived in medina he bought another house near muhammads abu bakr the first caliph of islam by muhammad habibur rahman khan sherwani published 1963 sh muhammad ashraf original from the university of michigan digitized 14 november 2006 
the climate of mecca was dry but the climate of medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants so that on arrival most of them fell sick abu bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by khaarijah and his family at mecca abu bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in medina he was a wholesaler and had his store at sunh and from there cloth was supplied to the market at medina soon his business flourished at medina early in 623 abu bakrs daughter  who was already engaged to muhammad was handed over to muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony and this further strengthened the relation between abu bakr and muhammad name maghazi 
in 624 abu bakr was involved in the first battle between the muslims and the quraysh of mecca known as the  but did not fight instead acting as one of the guards of muhammads tent in 625 he participated in the  which ended in a rout by the majority of the muslims before the battle begun abu bakrs son  who was still non muslim and was fighting from the side of the quraysh came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel abu bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by muhammad his son later converted to  and gained fame during the  as a fierce warrior in the second phase of the battle ’s cavalry attacked the muslims from behind changing a muslim victory to defeat many muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war so did abu bakr however he was among the first to return according to few  hadith   and a few other muslims remained guarding muhammad from the attacks of the quraysh soldiers majority of  and many sunni hadith agree to this criticisms of his lacklustre military achievements in comparison with the extremely accomplished ali should be put into context abu bakr was a middle aged man during these battles was not a soldier but a merchant by trade and had never seen battle before – it may thus be unfair to directly compare him with ali in this regard
however it is related that once  asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men everyone replied that ali was the bravest of all men thereupon ali said
in sunni accounts during one such attack two discs from abu bakrs shield penetrated into muhammads cheeks abu bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah requested he leave the matter to him losing his two s during the process in these stories subsequently abu bakr along with other companions led muhammad to a place of safety name maghazi

in 630 he was part of  and  in the battle of hunayn as the muslim army passed through the valley of hunayn some eleven miles north east of  a rain of arrows fell on it let loose by a group of archers of the hostile tribes that lay hid in the mountain pass taken unaware the advance guard of the muslim army fled in panic there was considerable confusion and the camels horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover muhammad stood firm there were only nine companions around him including abu bakr all the rest had fled under the instructions of muhammad abbas shouted at the top of his voice o muslims come to the prophet of allah the call was heard by the muslim soldiers and they gathered beside muhammad when the muslim had gathered in sufficient number muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy in the hand to hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to 
muhammad posted a contingent to guard the hunayn pass and led the main army to autas in the confrontation at autas the tribes could not withstand the muslim onslaught finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to taif
abu bakr was commissioned by muhammad to lead the attack against taif from autas the muslim forces set out for taif the tribes shut themselves in the fort and used to come out in the open the muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town but this did not lead to any tangible results the muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective
the siege dragged on for two weeks and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort muhammad held a council of war abu bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that god would himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort the advice was accepted and in february 630 the siege of taif was raised and the muslim army returned to  a few days later malik bin auf the commander came to  and became a muslim thus the forecast of abu bakr came to be fulfilled and the god himself arranged for the surrender of taifsidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 46 printed and published by a salam ferozsons ltd 60 shahrah e quaid e azam lahore

the call to arms was given at a very critical period the weather was burning hot crops were ripe and ready for harvesting the journey was long and arduous many persons perred to stay back in spite of these obstacles and difficulties an army of thirty thousand persons was raised the army assembled at al jorf outside  muhammad remained at medina for some time to attend to other affairs and at al jorf abu bakr deputised for muhammad and led the prayers
the muslim army reached tabuk after a weary march at tabuk the standard of the army was entrusted to abu bakr there were no  forces to meet the muslims on coming to know of the advance of the muslim army the byzantines had withdrawn their army well within  the muslim achieved their object without fighting a shot the byzantines who had at one time threatened to invade  were no longer in the mood to measure swords with the muslimssidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 47 48 
in 631 ad muhammad sent from medina a delegation of three hundred muslims to perform the  according to the new islamic way abu bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates abu bakr had thus the honour of being the first amir ul hajj in the history of 
some time after abu bakr and his party had left for hajj muhammad received  a revelation about the regulation of the hajj and the ordering of relationships with the infidels it is related that when this revelation came some one suggested to muhammad that he should send news of it to abu bakr muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation
muhammad summoned ali and asked him to proclaim the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at  ali went forth on muhammads slit eared camel and overtook abu bakr when ali joined the party abu bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them ali said that he had not come to replace abu bakr as amir ul hajj and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of muhammad
at mecca abu bakr presided at the hajj ceremony and ali read the proclamation on behalf of muhammad the main points of the proclamation were
#henceforward the non muslims were not to be allowed to visit the  or perform the pilgrimage
#no one should circumambulate the kaaba naked
# was not to be tolerated where the muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists
from the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in  henceforward islam alone was to be supreme in arabia
in some quarters an argument is advanced that as on this occasion the proclamation was read by  on behalf of  this establishes the precedence of ali over abu bakr and that theore when after the death of muhammad abu bakr became the  in disregard of the claims of ali he was a usurper
on this occasion ali did not replace abu bakr as amir ul hajj ali was merely assigned a special mission to read the proclamation as according to muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation we can thus say that on this occasion abu bakr represented the temporal side while ali represented the spiritual side after the death of muhammad there was no longer the question of any spiritual representation the issue was only temporal representation and for this abu bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented muhammad even in his lifetimesidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by prof masud ul hasan page 49 50

a short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage muhammad became ill in his fatal illness muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit after thanking and praising god he said  allah has given one of his slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly life whatever he likes or to accept the good which is with allah so he has chosen that good which is with allah
abu bakr wept profusely and said our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you the companions were astonished by this they wondered why abu bakr wept and the people said look at this old man allahs apostle talks about a  to whom he has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with him while he says our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you it turned out muhammad himself was that servant as abu bakr later told the companions

after assuming the office of  abu bakrs first address was as follows
abu bakrs caliphate lasted for 27 months during which he crushed the rebellion of the arab tribes throughout the  in the successful  in the last months of his rule he sent general khalid ibn al walid on conquests  in  and  in  this would set in motion a historical trajectory name donner   continued later on by  and  that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the  he had little time to pay attention to the administration of state though state affairs remained stable during his caliphate on the advice of umar and abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade
according to  abu bakr was instrumental in preserving the quran in written form it is said that after the hard won victory over musaylimah in the battle of yamama fought in 632 umar the later caliph umar saw that many of the muslims who had memorized the quran  about 300 to 700 had died in battle fearing that the quran may be lost or corrupted umar requested the caliph abu bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format after initial hesitation abu bakr made a committee headed by  which included the memorizers of the quran and umar and to collect all verses of the book after collecting all quranic verses from texts in the possession of various   and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the quran after they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in codex form to the caliph abu bakr it is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of muhammad when most of his  companions were still alive
prior to his death abu bakr gave this authorized copy of the quran to umar – his successor as caliph it remained with him throughout his tenure as caliph 10 years prior to his death umar gave this book to his daughter  who was one of the wives of muhammad umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed and thus perred to leave this copy with hafsa so as not to indicate his personal perence of who would be the next caliph later on it became the basis of s definitive text of the quran which was published far and wide merely 18 years after the death of muhammad later historians give uthman ibn affan the principal credit for re verification and publishing the quran  twelver shiites reject the idea that abu bakr or umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the quran 
on 23 august 634 abu bakr fell sick and did not recover due to his old age
abu bakr developed high  and was confined to bed his illness was prolonged and when his condition worsened he felt that his end was near realizing his death was near he sent for  and requested him to perform his  since ali had also done it for muhammad
abu bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the muslims after his death though there was already controversy over ali not having been appointedsidiq i akbar hazrat abu bakr by masudul hasan lahore ferozsons 1976  
he appointed umar as his successor after discussing with some companions some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it due to the tough nature of umar
abu bakr thus dictated his last testament to  as follows
abu bakr next asked  as to how many pieces of cloth were used for muhammads shroud aisha said that three pieces had been used abu bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud on monday 23 august 634 abu bakr died the funeral prayer was led by umar he was buried the same night by the side of muhammads grave in aishas house near al masjid al nabawi
today there are many families which are the descendants of abu bakr most of them are known by the name  and al atiqis or al atiqi al ateeqi in arabic but they are also known by some other names in different localities for example in east   are usually called  which means people of the religion as they were the first to bring islam to this area in  they are commonly known as  and they are well respected by other  clans in  they are known by the name of  there are also al atiqi or atiqi families in saudi arabia kuwait syria yemen iraq and other places in the arabia peninsula all the descendants of abu bakr their ancestors are abdurahman ibn abu bakr and muhammad ibn abu bakr the al bakri family in egypt are the descendants of muhammad ibn abu bakr while the sheekhaal or fiqi umar family found in somalia ethiopia and kenya and the aala atiq families found in the arabia peninsula are the descendants of abdurahman ibn abu bakr
abu bakr became the caliph on 8 june 632 and he died on 23 august 634 he is considered by sunnis as the greatest of all the companions of muhammad jubayr ibn mutim reported that a woman came and spoke to muhammad about a matter he asked her to come back later some time she said tell me if i come later and do not find you jubayr ibn mutim said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back he said if you do not find me then go to abu bakr name sunnahcom 
this particular hadith is used by sunnis and scholars of hadith to demonstrate the superiority of abu bakr over all other companions of muhammad and his rightful succession to muhammad
though the period of his caliphate covers only two years two months and fifteen days it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time the  and 
abu bakr had the distinction of being the first caliph in the history of islam and also the first caliph to nominate a successor he was the only caliph in the history of islam who unded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate name archiveorg

he has the distinction of purchasing the land for

 muslims also consider abu bakr as one of  al ‘ashara al mubashshara whom muhammad had testified were destined for paradise he is regarded as the successor of allahs messenger khalifa rasulullah and first of the rightly guided caliphs – ie  and being the rightful successor to muhammad abu bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of muhammad throughout his life he was always there beside muhammad at every major event it was abu bakrs wisdom that muhammad always honored abu bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of muhammad as umar ibn khattab stated that if the faith of abu bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth the faith of abu bakr would outweigh the othersnarrated by al bayhaqi in ‘al jamia’ lashu’ab al eemaan’ 118 and its narrators are trustworthy 
 
the   believe that  was supposed to assume the  and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by muhammad as his successor at  it is also believed that abu bakr and umar conspired to take over power in the muslim nation after muhammads death in a  against ali the twelver shia do not view abu bakrs being with muhammad in the cave when the two fled mecca as a meritorious act and indeed find significant criticism of abu bakr in the quranic verse of the cave
some   criticize abu bakr because after muhammads death abu bakr used to grant muhammads daughter  the lands of the village of  which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death he used to accept the testimony of her witnesses so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father however abu bakr replied by saying that muhammad had told him that the prophets of god do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he used to give her the lands of fadakhttp  wwwal islamorg fatima the gracious abu muhammad ordoni abu bakr versus fatima az zahra sa al islamorg fatima the gracious by abu   muhammad ordoni 1987  section entitled abu bakr versus fatima az zahra sabrsee also sahih al bukhari volume 5 book 57 number 60 which says fatima sent somebody to abu bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the prophet from what allah had given to his apostle through fai ie booty gained without fighting she asked for the sadaqa ie wealth assigned for charitable purposes of the prophet at medina and fadak and what remained of the khumus ie one fifth of the khaibar booty abu bakr said allahs apostle said we prophets our property is not inherited and whatever we leave is sadaqa but muhammads family can eat from this property ie allahs property but they have no right to take more than the food they need by allah i will not bring any change in dealing with the sadaqa of the prophet and will keep them as they used to be observed in his ie the prophets life time and i will dispose with it as allahs apostle used to do then ali said i testify that none has the right to be worshipped but allah and that muhammad is his apostle and added o abu bakr we acknowledge your superiority then he ie ali mentioned their own relationship to allahs apostle and their right abu bakr then spoke saying by allah in whose hands my life is i love to do good to the relatives of allahs apostle rather than to my own relatives abu bakr added look at muhammad through his family

according to the author of his biography in the eleventh edition of the encyclopædia britannica ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest in his relations with his brother humanists such as  he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of greek theological authors

ambrosians are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around  and also a 16th century sect of 
only the oldest of the catholic ambrosians the fratres s ambrosii ad nemus had anything more than a very local significance this order is known from a  of  addressed to the s of the church of st ambrose outside milan
saint  bishop of milan certainly did not found  though he took an interest in the  and watched over its beginnings in his  providing for the needs of a  outside the walls of milan as  recounts in his  ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of virgins as also of widows his exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings de virginibus de viduis de virginitate de institutione virginis de exhortatione virginitatis and de lapsu virginis consecratae ambrose was the only father of the church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of  communities which later became formal monasteries of women 
it is against this background that two religious orders or congregations—one of men and one of women when founded in the milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries—took saint ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name
the first of these groups was formed in a wood outside milan by three noble milanese alexander grivelli antonio petrasancta and albert besuzzi who were joined by others including some  priests in 1375  gave them the rule of st augustine with set of constitutions as a canonically recognized order they took the name fratres sancti ambrosii ad nemus and adopted a habit consisting of a brown   and hood the brethren elected a superior with the title of  who was then instituted by the  the priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes in the liturgy they followed the  various monasteries were founded on these lines but without any formal bond between them in 1441  merged them into one congregation called congregatio sancti ambrosii ad nemus made the original house the main seat and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter there was a rector or superior general who was assisted by two visitors
saint charles borromeo archbishop of milan successfully ormed their discipline grown lax in 1579 in 1589  united to the congregation of st ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the brothers of the apostles of the poor life or  apostolini or brothers of st barnabas whose houses were in the province of genoa and in the march of ancona this was an order that had been founded by giovanni scarpa at the end of the 15th century the union  was confirmed by  in 1606 at which time the congregation added the name of st barnabas to its title adopted new constitutions divided its houses into four provinces two of them st clements and st pancrass being in rome published works have survived from the pen of ascanio tasca and michele mulozzani each of whom was superior general and of zaccaria visconti francesco maria guazzi and paolo fabulotti although various ambrosians were given the title of blessed in recognition of their holiness antonio gonzaga of mantua filippo of fermo and gerardo of monza the order was eventually dissolved by  in 1650
the nuns of st ambrose ambrosian sisters wore a habit of the same colour as the brothers of st ambrose conformed to their constitutions and followed the  but were independent in government  gave the nuns canonical status in 1474 their one monastery was on the top of monte varese near lago maggiore on the spot where their foundress the blessed catarina morigia or catherine of palanza had first led a solitary life  other early nuns were the blessed juliana of puriselli benedetta bimia and lucia alciata the nuns were esteemed by st charles borromeo 
another group of cloistered nuns of st ambrose also called the annunciatae italian annunziate of lombardy or sisters of st marcellina were founded in 1408 by three young women of pavia dorothea morosini eleonora contarini and veronica duodi their houses scattered throughout lombardy and venetia were united into a congregation by st pius v under the rule of st augustine with a mother house residence of the prioress general at pavia one of the nuns in this group was saint  who died on september 14 1510
in some sense also ambrosians are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by st  archbishop of milan all priests or destined to become priests they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop the model for this was a society that already existed at brescia under the name of priests of peace in august 1578 the new society was inaugurated being entrusted with the church of the holy sepulchre and given the name of oblates of st ambrose they later received the approbation of gregory xiii st charles died in 1584 these oblates were dispersed by  in 1810 while another group called the oblates of our lady of rho escaped this fate in 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of oblates of st charles and reassigned the house of the holy sepulchre in the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries including the oblates of st charles established in london by cardinal nicholas wiseman

ambrosiaster is the name given to the writer of a commentary on st  epistles brief in words but weighty in matter and valuable for the criticism of the  text of the  the commentary itself was written during the papacy of  that is between 366 and 384 and is considered an important document of the latin text of paul before the  of  and of the interpretation of paul prior to  name ocd 
this commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to st  in 1527 though  threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to ambrose erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name ambrosiaster literally in latin would be ambrose to describe its author the credit for this nickname should go to the maurists as rené hoven has shown the name has remained with the unknown author name ocd  attempts to identify this ambrosiaster with known authors has continued but with no success because  cites ambrosiasters commentary on romans 512 under the name of hilary many critics have attempted to identify ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named hilary active in the period in 1899  suggested that the writer was isaacrev dhist et de litt religieuses tom iv 97 f  a converted jew and writer of a tract on the trinity and incarnation who was exiled to  in 378 380 and then relapsed to  but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of  proconsul of  in 377 alternatively  attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to ambrose in his complete edition of that fathers work this is extremely problematic though since it would require ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop and then added to it in later years incorporating later remarks of  on romans study of ambrosiaster cambridge univ press 1905  no identifications theore have acquired lasting popularity with scholars and his identity remains a mystery
several other minor works have been attributed to this same author along with a lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates the quaestiones veteris et novi testamenti which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to  in 1905 alexander souter established that this work should also be attributed to ambrosiaster name ocd  name david g hunter 2010 p307david g hunter fourth century latin writers in frances young lewis ayres and andrew louth eds the cambridge history of early christian literature 2010 p307  fragments of several other works have been ascribed with some certainty to ambrosiaster a commentary on matthew 24 a discussion of the parable of the three measures of flour into which a woman placed yeast and a treatment of peters denial and the arrest of jesus in gethsemane the attribution of other fragments to ambrosiaster though is more tentative name david g hunter 2010 p307 
despite the elusive identity of ambrosiaster several facts about him can be established internal evidence suggests he was active at rome during the reign of pope damasus 366 384 and almost certainly a member of the roman clergy there are strong indications he objected to jeromes efforts to revise the old latin versions of the gospels and that he was critical of jeromes activity among ascetic women at rome ambrosiaster shows a deep interest in judaism and often notes that christian practices derive from jewish traditiondavid g hunter fourth century latin writers in frances young lewis ayres and andrew louth eds the cambridge history of early christian literature 2010 p308

 a gentleman who perhaps alone of the romans had survived the shock of this notable storm certainly his parents who had worn the purple were slain in it his descendants in our day have become greatly inferior to their grandfathers avita excellence under him our people regained their strength and challenged the victors to battle the lord assented and the battle went their way   name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
some basic information on ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a  gildas says that he won his battles with s help name fletcher_15   ambrosius parents were slain by the saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
according to gildas ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the saxon invaders however this victory was not decisive sometimes the saxons and sometimes the citizens meaning the romano british inhabitants were victorious
two points in gildas description have attracted much scholarly commentary the first is what gildas meant by saying ambrosius family had worn the purple s and roman males of the  wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the erence to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage  tribuni militum senior officers in roman legions wore a similar purple band so the erence may be to a family background of military leadership the tradition was old as the s and  of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band in the church the purple is a euphemism for blood and theore wearing the purple may be a erence to martyrdom name gidlow_80  name craughwellcraughwell 2008 p 106 112  or a bishops robe in addition in the later  both s and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe the  a roman catalogue of official posts lists four or five provincial governors in  and two of them were of consular rank one was the governor of  and the other that of  the parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors whose names were not recorded name ashleyashley 2005 de excidio unnumbered pages 
it has been suggested by historian alex woolf that ambrosius may have been related to the 5th century romano british usurpers  or  – woolf expresses a perence based on nomenclature for marcus name woolf_354  frank d reno an arthurian scholar has instead argued that the name aurelianus indicates the possible descent of ambrosius from the   aurelian reigned 270 275 aurelians military campaigns included the conquest of the  n j higham suggests that ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late  such as the  branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western roman provinces like  name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66 
 instead focuses on the name ambrosius in his view it seems to suggest connection to  a 4th century  who also served as consular governor in areas of  the namesake father of the bishop was a  and his areas included britain  ashley suggests that ambrosius aurelianus was related to the two aurelii ambrosii name ashley  tim venning points out that the name aurelianus could be the result of a  when a boy was adopted into a new  clan he received the family names of his new family plus an additional  indicating his descent from his original gens family the additional cognomen often had the form  anus when  from gens  was adopted into the  family his new name became gaius julius caesar octavianus name venning  in this case ambrosius may have been a member of gens  who was adopted by another gens family his original name aurelius became aurelianus name venning 
the second question is the meaning of the word avita gildas could have meant ancestors or intended it to mean more specifically grandfather – thus indicating ambrosius lived about a generation before the  lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions
n j higham who wrote a book on gildas and the literary tropes he used has suggested that gildas may have had considerable motives for placing attention to ambrosius he was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man but setting him as an example to his contemporaries it was essential to the philosophy of gildas that briton leaders who achieved victory over the s were only able to do so because of divine aid and only those who had superior christian virtues were deserving of this aid name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66  ambrosius aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians in order to fit him in his worldview gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptionable virtues and obedient to god he was made to fit gildas version of a model leader name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66 
higham also suggests that the roman lineage of ambrosius was highlighted for a reason gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the romans he was also contrasting him with the subsequent briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66 
while gildas is a primary source for the  he never mentions the names of the combatants theore we can not know if ambrosius aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  the names of the saxon leaders in the battle are also not recorded 
the identities of ambrosius descendants are unknown since gildas never identifies them by name it is safe to assume that they were gildas contemporaries and known to the author name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66  that the work portrays ambrosius descendants as so inferior to their ancestor would be part of his criticism on rulers of his time those criticized were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor name highamhigham 1994 p 35 66  mike ashley suggests that the descendants of ambrosius could include other people named by gildas he favors the inclusion in this category of one  aurelius the little dog or aurelius the whelp who gildas accuses of    and warmongering his name aurelius suggests romano british descent the insulting nickname caninus was probably invented by gildas himself who similarly insults other contemporary rulers due to the name used by gildas there are theories that this ruler was actually named    some identify him with  a 6th century  though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of gildas or lived one or two generations following him name ashley  another theory is that this ruler did not reign in britain but in  caninus in this view might be  great dog conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of gildas conomor was likely from  an area of brittany controlled by british immigrants from  he might be remembered in british legend as  name ashley 
though gildas primarily features the saxons as barbarian raiders their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest by the year 500 possibly the time described by gildas  controlled the      and coastal areas of  and  the rest of the former  was still under the control of the local britons name craughwell  gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably lects fact  once a major city was completely abandoned during the 5th century name craughwell  name ashley 
 follows gildas account of ambrosius in his  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  but in his chronica majora he dates ambrosius victory to the reign of the  474–491
bedes treatment of the 5th century history of great britain is not particularly valuable as a source until about the year 418 bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of  following the end of orosius history bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on gildas entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of gildas account with mostly stylistic changes name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  bedes account of ambrosius aurelianus has been translated as following
when the army of the enemy had exterminated or scattered the native peoples they returned home and the britons slowly began to recover strength and courage they emerged from their hiding places and with one accord they prayed for the help of god that they might not be completely annihilated their leader at that time was a certain ambrosius aurelianus a discreet man who was as it happened the sole member of the roman race who had survived this storm in which his parents who bore a royal and famous name had perished under his leadership the britons regained their strength challenged their victors to battle and with gods help won the day  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
bede does not mention the descendants of ambrosius aurelianus nor their supposed degeneracy name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
the  attributed to  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  preserves several snippets of lore about ambrosius despite the traditional attribution the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians there are several extant manuscript versions of the work varying and details the most important ones have been dated to between the 9th and the 11th century the possibility of a single writer or compiler seems unlikely as the work may have taken centuries to reach its final form name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
in chapter 31 we are told that  ruled in fear of ambrosius this is the first mention of ambrosius in the work according to frank d reno this would indicate that ambrosius influence was formidable since vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore roman rule in britain name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the chapter relates events following the end of roman rule in britain and preceding vortigerns alliance with the saxons name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
the most significant appearance of ambrosius is the story about ambrosius vortigern and the two s beneath  fortress of ambrosius in chapters 40–42 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  in this account ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers he intimidates vortigern and the royal  when it is reveled that ambrosius is the son of a  vortigern is convinced to  to the younger man the castle of dinas emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of britain vortigern then retreats to the north in an area called gwynessi name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  this story was later retold with more detail by  in his fictionalized  conflating the personage of ambrosius with the welsh tradition of  the visionary known for  utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native ic inhabitants of britain over the  and the  geoffrey also introduces him into the historia under the name aurelius ambrosius as one of three sons of  along with  and 
in chapter 48 ambrosius aurelianus is described as  the chapter records that pascent the son of vortigern was granted rule over the regions of  and  by ambrosius name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  lastly in chapter 66 various events are dated from a  often identified with   ese of  near  which is said to have been between ambrosius and vitolinus the author dates this battle to taking place 12 years from the reign of vortigern name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
it is not clear how these various traditions about ambrosius relate to each other or whether they come from the same tradition it is very possible that these erences are to different men with the same name frank d reno points that the works calls all these men ambrosius emrys alone the  aurelianus is never used name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the  dates the battle of guoloph to the twelfth year of vortigern by which the year 437 seems to be meant name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  this is perhaps a generation before the battle that gildas says was commanded by ambrosius aurelianus
the text never identifies who ambrosiuss father is just gives his title as a roman consul when an adolescent ambrosius speaks of his father there is no suggestion that this father is deceased the boy is not identified as an orphan name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the exact age of ambrosius in his one encounter with vortigern is not given frank d reno suggests that he might be as young as 13 years old barely a teenager name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
it is impossible to know to what degree ambrosius actually wielded political power and over what area because ambrosius and vortigern are shown in the historia brittonum as being in conflict some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another one headed by ambrosius and the other by vortigern  built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in  lected an actively provincial outlook in britain and that vortigern represented the pelagian party while ambrosius led the  one subsequent historians accepted myers speculation as fact creating a narrative of events in 5th century britain with various degrees of elaborate detail yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the historia brittonum is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of vortigern who at this time were a ruling house in  this interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about vortigern in the historia brittonum which include his alleged practice of as argued by nora k chadwick a note on the name vortigern in studies in early british history cambridge university press 1954 p 41 
the identity of ambrosius last mentioned enemy vitalinus is somewhat obscure various manuscripts of the historia and translations render his name guitolin guitolini guitholini and vitalinus he is mentioned in chapter 49 as one of four sons of  and co founder of the city of  no other background information is given name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  there are theories that gloiu is also the father of vortigern but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found there have been further attempts to identify vitalinus with a pro vortigern or anti roman faction in britain opposed to the rise of the romano british ambrosius however this is rendered problematic since vitalinus seems to also have a romano british name the traditional view of pro roman and pro briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
ambrosius appears briefly in the  deeds of the kings of the english by  despite its name the work attempted to reconstruct british history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of gildas bede nennius and various chroniclers name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  the work features ambrosius as the apparent employer of  the relative passage has been translated as following
on the death of  the strength of the britons grew faint their diminished hopes went backwards and straight way they would have come to ruin had not ambrosius the sole survivor of the romans who was monarch of the realm after  repressed the overweening s through the distinguished achievements of the warlike arthur  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
william swiftly shifts attention from ambrosius to arthur and proceeds to narrate arthurs supposed victory in the  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  the narrative is probably the first to connect ambrosius and arthur william had to reconcile the accounts of gildas and bede who implied that ambrosius was connected to the battle and that of nennius which clearly stated that it was arthur who was connected to the battle he solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it ambrosius as the king of the britons and arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
ambrosius aurelianus appears in later pseudo chronicle tradition beginning with s  with the slightly garbled name aurelius ambrosius now presented as son of a king constantine when king constantines eldest son constans is murdered at vortigerns instigation the two remaining sons ambrosius and uther still very young are quickly hustled into exile in  this does not fit with gildas account in which ambrosius family perished in the turmoil of the saxon uprisings later when vortigerns power has faded the two brothers return from exile with a large army destroy vortigern and become friends with   they go on to defeat the saxon leader  in two battles at maisbeli probably ballifield near  and    hengist is executed and ambrosius becomes king of britain however he is poisoned by his enemies and uther succeeds him the text identifies the poisoner as eopa name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
judgements of the value of geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller tend to wildly vary he has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources and condemned for an excessive use of  and possibly inventing stories wholecloth 
 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  according to frank d reno whenever geoffrey uses extant sources the details in the text tend to be accurate assuming he was also using sources lost to us it may be difficult to decide which details are truthful and which  reno suggests that individual judgements have to be made about various elements of his narrative name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
geoffrey changed the word aurelianus to  which is the  of a roman  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  geoffrey retains the story of emrys and the dragons from nennius but identifies the figure with  merlin is geoffreys version of a historical figure known as  myrddin is only mentioned once in the  at an entry dated to 573 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the name of merlin is given in latin as ambrosius merlinus merlinus may have been intended as the  of a roman or romano british individual like ambrosius name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
elements of ambrosius aurelianus the traditional warrior king are used by geoffrey for other characters ambrosius supposed supernatural powers are passed to merlin geoffreys aurelius ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called  the role of warrior king is shared by uther and his son  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
geoffrey also uses the character  father of vitalinus vitolinus deriving from nennius he names this character as a son of claudius and appointed by his father as duke of the  his predecessor as duke is called  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  assuming that claudius and arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries then this claudius is the roman emperor  reigned 41–54 that claudius would have living grandsons in the 5th century four centuries following his death seems rather unlikely reno suggests that a claudius more likely to have living descendants in the 5th century would be  reigned 268–270 name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
geoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of ambrosius he is supposedly a paternal nephew of  king of brittany son of  and an unnamed briton noblewoman adoptive grandson on his mothers side of guthelinus vitalinus  younger brother of  and older brother of  name ashley2ashley 2005 geoffrey of monmouth unnumbered pages  ambrosius and uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather guthelinus vitalinus name ashley2  although it is not explicitly covered in geoffreys narrative this genealogy makes constantine and his children descendants of  legendary founder of the line of kings of brittany conan is also featured in the historia regum britanniae where he is appointed king by the roman emperor  reigned 383 388 name ashley2 
constantines reign is placed by geoffrey as following the  mentioned by gildas constantine is reported killed by a  and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis candidates for the throne included all three sons of constantine but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne constans was a  and ambrosius and uther were  and still in their  name ashley2  the crisis is resolved when  places constans on the throne and then serves as his chief  and  when constans is killed by the picts serving as bodyguards of vortigern vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed ambrosius is still underage and vortigern rises to the throne name ashley2 
the chronology offered by geoffrey for the early life life of ambrosius contradicts gildas and nennius and is also internally inconsistent name ashley2  the  involves an appeal by the britons to roman consul agitius this person has been identified with  d 454  master of soldiers of the  and consul of the year 446 the groans are generally dated to the 440s and 450s preceding the death of aetius if geoffreys constantine rose to the throne immediately following the groans this would place his reign in this period name ashley2  geoffrey gives a 10 year reign for constantine and his marriage lasts just as long however the eldest son constans is clearly older than 10 years old by the time his father dies he is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career even assuming there is a time gap between the death of constantine and the adulthood of constans his younger brothers 
have not aged at all in the narrative name ashley2 
geoffreys narrative has an underage ambrosius if not a literal  in the 460s accounts deriving from gildas and nennius place ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade name ashley2  most telling is that geoffrey has vortigern rising to the throne in the 460s nennius places the rise of vortigern in the year 425 and vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the 460s suggesting that he was deceased by that time name ashley2 
geoffreys narrative includes as a major character  as leader of the saxons he is also featured as the father of queen  and father in law of vortigern name ashley2  other saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer but their names tend to correspond to anglo saxons known from other sources name ashley2  henginsts supposed son octa is apparently  a 6th century ruler variously connected to hengist as a son or descendant the other son ebissa is more difficult to identify he might correspond to kinsmen of hengist variously identified as ossa  and aesc a minor saxon character called cherdic is probably  though elsewhere geoffrey calls the same king cheldric he actually may appear under three different names in the narrative since geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of hengist ceretic a variant of the same name name ashley2 
geoffrey in the last chapters featuring vortigern has the king served by  this detail derives from nennius though nennius was talking about vortigerns wise men they may not have been magic users but advisers name ashley2  vortigerns encounter with emrys merlin takes place in this part of the narrative merlin warns vortigern that ambrosius and uther have already sailed for britain and are soon to arrive apparently to claim his throne ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king he besieges vortigern at the castle of genoreu which is identified with nennius cair guorthigirn   and the  at  ambrosius burns the castle down and vortigern dies with it name ashley2 
having killed vortigern ambrosius next turns his attention to hengist despite the fact that no earlier military actions of ambrosius are recorded the saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess they immediately retreat beyond the  name ashley2  hengist soon amasses a massive army to face ambrosius his army counts 200000 men and ambrosius only 10000 men he marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in maisbeli where ambrosius emerges the victor it is unclear what location geoffrey had in mind maisbeli translates to the field of beli and could be related to the  of welsh legend and or the   alternatively it could be a field where the  festival was celebrated name ashley2  geoffrey could derive the name from a similar sounding toponym for example  of the  old north traditionally identified with  name ashley2 
following his defeat hengist retreats towards cunungeburg geoffrey probably had in mind  not far from hatfield name ashley2  ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the saxons the second battle is more evenly fought and hengist has a chance to achieve victory however ambrosius receives reinforcements from brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favor of the britons hengist himself is captured by his old enemy  and decapitated soon after the battle the surviving saxon leaders octa and eosa submit themselves to ambrosius rule he pardons them and grants them an area near  the area is not named but geoffrey could be basing this on  a real ango saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of scotland and england name ashley2 
geoffrey closely connects the deaths of vortigern and hengist which are elsewhere poorly recorded vortigern historically died in the 450s and various dates for the death of hengist have been proposed between the 450s and the 480s name ashley2   the supposed son and heir of hengist was still alive in the 6th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father the ruling family of the  were called the oiscingas a term identifying them as descendants of  not of hengist in effect none of them was likely a literal son of hengist and their relation to hengist may have been a later invention geoffrey did not invent the connection but his sources here were likely legendary  in nature name ashley2 
following his victories and the end of the wars ambrosius organizes the burial of killed nobles at kaercaradduc geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with caer caradog  ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to merlin the result is the so called giants ring name ashley2  its location in the vicinity of salisbury has led to its identification with  though geoffrey never uses that term stonehedge is closer to  than salisbury the ring formation of the monument could equally apply to  the largest stone circle in europe name ashley2 
in welsh legend and texts ambrosius appears as emrys wledig emperor ambrose name venning  the term wledig is a title used by senior royal and military commanders who have achieved notable success the term is mostly used for famous figures such as  though a few obscure figures have been given the title name venning 
in s merlin he is called simply pendragon and his younger brother is named uter which he changes to uterpendragon after the death of the elder sibling this is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from s  wace usually only ers to li roi the king without naming him and someone has taken an early mention of uthers epithet pendragon as the name of his brother
peter korrel supports the view that ambrosius aurelianus and  might be the same person a theory also supported by others debating the  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  he points that all accounts about ambrosius can be traced back to gildas and all accounts about arthur can be traced back to nennius with the two figures being very similar name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
both figures have been connected to the  and have been portrayed as its sole hero name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  their identity as kings is a later addition they are originally depicted as war leaders of the britons in their wars with the saxons the latin term  can be applied to both of them name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  both figures are of roman descent with ambrosius this is featured in both his name and stated background with arthur this is implied since the name seems to derive from  the name of a minor roman  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
both figures are known for their  ambrosius is featured as the one who manages to re assemble the desperate britons encourage them to fight once again and make a stand against the seemingly superior enemy this would require personal courage arthur is reported to have single handedly faced numerically superior enemies name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  both figures are devout s whose victories are attributed to divine protection name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30  in both cases the battle of badon seems to be the final victory of a long war bedas states that ambrosius started the war against the saxons and both factions had victories and losses until the war concluded in the battle of badon in arthurian narratives arthur is said to have led the britons in 12 victories with the battle of badon being the last of them name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
korrel admits that there is a significant difference ambrosius both won and lost battles while arthur reportedly never lost a battle but this is probably the difference between a historical figure and one featured in  name korrelkorrel 1984 p 5 30 
 has suggested ambrosius is identical to  a brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the goths in france around the year 470 fleuriot argues that ambrosius led the britons in the battle in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to  he then returned to britain to continue the war against the saxons name   leoléon fleuriot les origines de la bretagne l’émigration parispayot 1980 p 170 
frank d reno suggests a connection or identification of ambrosius with  this enigmatic character appears historically only in  of  he is not mentioned at all by   the  and the  vortimer does appear in  by  but in a manner suggesting that geoffrey used nennius as a source name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
the historia brittonum features detailed information about vortimer as a warrior king robert huntingdon fletcher was the first to note the similarities between gilas ambrosius and nenniusvortimer he suggested that vortimer practically replaces ambrosius in nennius account ambrosius is also featured by nennius as a powerful leader but he receives only a few minor notices in the text name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  fletcher theorized that gildas text represented a roman faction in britain while nennius drew from an oral and literary legend tradition of a briton faction name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
the difference in names between the two figures may be deceptive vortimer might be not a proper name but an  or a title name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  etymologically the name of vortigern vortimers father seems to derive from vor over and a term for chieftain or king the meaning would be overking similarly vortimer may derive from the older celtic vortamorix in this case vor means over tamo is a   and  means king rix is a cognate to   which has the same meaning name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  the meaning of vortimer would be over most king or highest king a synonym for  name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
reno agrees with his predecessor scholars that vortimer is an epithet or title of a king mentioned by other names he rejects however a proposed identification of vortigern and vortimer he points that vortigern is last mentioned in the anglo saxon chronicle c 455 as fighting against his former ally  the outcome is not mentioned but the saxon campaigns then continue for decades reno views vortigern as a probable early casualty in the war name renoreno 1996 p 263 282  he suggests that vortimer was an epithet of the succeeding king ambrosius aurelianus name renoreno 1996 p 263 282 
it has been suggested that the place name  in  might preserve the name of ambrosius and that perhaps amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century   scholars such as shimon applebaum have found a number of  through the midland dialect regions of britain that incorporate the ambre  element examples include  in   in   in   in gloucestershire and  in west sussex these scholars have claimed this element represents an  word amor the name of a woodland bird however amesbury in wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the midland dialect place names if this etymology is combined with the tradition reported by geoffrey of monmouth stating that ambrosius aurelianus ordered the building of  – which is located within the parish of amesbury and where ambrosius was supposedly buried – and with the presence of an   also in that parish then it may be tempting to connect ambrosius with amesbury

the first mention of the ammon in the bible is in  it is stated there that they descended from ben ammi a son of  through incest with his younger daughter name c  bénámmî literally means son of my people after the destruction of  the daughters of lot had sexual relations with their father resulting in ammon and his half brother  being conceived and born this narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the israelites expressed their loathing of the moabites and ammonites  name a  however according to the same source doubts remain as to whether the israelites would have been willing to attribute such an irony to lot himself
the bible record does not mention anything else of the nation until centuries later when they invaded the  lands east of jordan between the  and  dispossessing them and dwelling in their place the ammonites erred to the giants as  name b

the constant harassment of the israelite communities east of the jordan by the ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under   king  started to enslave the people of  and he threatened to gouge out the right eyes of all the inhabitants eventually this led to an alliance with saul and the israelites and a battle between the two nations resulting in the victory of  and the forming of the israelite kingdom
during the reign of  the ammonites humiliated davids messengers and hired syrian armies to attack israel this eventually ended in a war and a year long siege of  the capital of ammon the war ended with all the ammonite cities being conquered and plundered and the inhabitants being killed at davids command  
when the syrians of damascus deprived the kingdom of israel of their possessions east of the jordan the ammonites became allies of  and a contingent of 1000 of them served as allies of syria in the great  of the syrians and assyrians at  in 854 bc in the reign of

the ammonites presented a serious problem to the  because many marriages between israelite men and ammonite and moabite women had taken place in the days of   the men had married women of the various nations without conversion which made the children not jewishthe identity of those particular tribes had been lost during the mixing of the nations caused by the conquests of  as a result people from those nations were treated as complete gentiles and could convert without restriction  the legitimacy of s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from ruth the moabitethe babylonian  points out that  was the source of this dispute he claimed that since david was descended from someone who was not allowed to marry into the community his male ancestors were no longer part of the  which was the tribe the king had to belong to  as a result he could neither be the king nor could he marry any jewish woman since he descended from a ite convert the prophet  wrote the book of ruth in order to remind the people of the original law that women from  and ammon were allowed to convert and marry into the jewish people immediately

he was also an accomplished  he lectured on  and is known to have written a treatise on the 
of his reputedly numerous writings only his commentary on aristotles de interpretatione survives intact a commentary on s  may also be his but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations
in de interpretatione ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent like
 in his second commentary and  this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer ammonius cites  who said knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known

ammonius saccas   fl 3rd century ad was a greek  from  who was often erred to as one of the founders of  he is mainly known as the teacher of  whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243 he was undoubtedly the biggest influence on plotinus in his development of  although little is known about his own philosophical views later  writers stated that ammonius was a christian but it is now generally assumed that there was a different  who wrote biblical texts
not much is known about the life of ammonius saccas 
his cognomen sakkas has been interpreted to indicate that he was a porter in his youthhttp  wwwccelorg ccel wace biodicthtmlterm ammonius%20saccas mozley jr ammonius saccas dictionary of early christian biography henry wace ed john murrary amp co london 1911  this seems to be a misreading of sakkas for sakkophoros porter which is grammatically incorrect however erich seebergseeberg erich ammonius sakas in zeitschrift für kirchengeschichte vol lx 1941 pp 136   170  argued that the cognomen ers to the  of india the ruling clan to which gautama buddha also belonged the Śākyas related to    and  were known in antiquitysee art india in pauly wissova col 1924  the cognomen sakkas theore erred to india benz ernst indische einflüsse auf die frühchristliche theologie in abhandlungen der geistes  und sozialwissenschaftlichen klasse jahrgang 1951 no 3 akademie der wissenschaften und der literatur mainz pp 1   34 pp 30ff  as a marker of ethnic identity this is according to this interpretation supported by the fact that ammianus marcellinus ers to him as saccas ammonius thus as the sacian ammoniusibidem  which makes any reading as denoting sakkos impossible this interpretation of the name which has subsequently been contestedclifford hindley ammonios sakkas his name and origin in zeitschrift für kirchengeschichte 75 1964 pp 332–336  would corroborate porphyrys report that plotinus ammonius foremost student acquired his high esteem for indian philosophy and his eager desire to travel to india from ammoniusibidem cf porphyrys vita plotini chapt 3  
the interpretation that saccas denotes ethnic northern indian origin rather than alluding to gautama buddha supports the possibility that ammonius may have been raised a christian who reverted to paganism as reported by eusebiuseusebius historia eccl vi 9  drawing on porphyrys contra christianos in this case ammonius may have been a second generation indian who remained in contact with the philosophy of his ancestral country the intensity of commerce of goods and ideas between alexandria and india makes this a wholly possible option 
the link to india however is not only consistent with plotinus passion for india but also helps to explain the often noted substantial agreements and shared ideas between vedanta and neoplatonism which are increasingly attributed to direct indian influenceharris r baine ed neoplatonism and indian thought norfolk va 1982  
most details of his life come from the fragments left from s writings the most famous pupil of ammonius saccas was  who studied under ammonius for eleven years according to porphyry in 232 at the age of 28 plotinus went to  to study philosophy
blockquotein his twenty eighth year he plotinus felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in alexandria who then had the highest reputation but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends the friend understanding the desire of his heart sent him to ammonius whom he had not so far tried he went and heard him and said to his friend this is the man i was looking for from that day he stayed continually with ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the indians name porphyry1porphyry life of plotinus from reale g 1990 a history of ancient philosophy iv the schools of the imperial age page 298 suny press  blockquote
according to porphyry the parents of ammonius were  but upon learning greek philosophy ammonius rejected his parents religion for  this conversion is contested by the christian writers  and  who state that ammonius remained a christian throughout his lifetime
blockquoteporphyry plainly utters a falsehood for what will not an opposer of christians do when he says that  ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs  ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life his works yet extant show this as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left name eusebius1eusebius history of the church vi 19  blockquote
however we are told by  that ammonius wrote nothinglonginus quoted by porphyry life of plotinus xx  and if ammonius was the principal influence on plotinus then it is unlikely that ammonius would have been a christian one way to explain much of the confusion concerning ammonius is to assume that there were two people called ammonius ammonius saccas who taught plotinus and an  who wrote biblical texts another explanation might be that there was only one ammonius but that origen who found the neo platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of christianity chose to suppress ammonius choice of paganism over christianity  the insistence of eusebius origens pupil and jerome all of whom were recognized fathers of the christian church that ammonius saccas had not rejected his christian roots would be easier for christians to accept than the assertion of prophyry who was a pagan that ammonius had chosen paganism over christianity
to add to the confusion it seems that ammonius had two pupils called origen  and  name eusebius1  it is quite possible that ammonius saccas taught both origens and since there were two origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later christians to accept that there were two individuals named ammonius one a christian and one a pagan  among ammonius other pupils there were  and 
 writing in the 5th century states that ammonius fundamental doctrine was that  and  were in full agreement with each otherhierocles in photius bibl cod 214 251 
blockquotehe was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority which were a disgrace to philosophy he apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers plato and aristotle and brought them under one and the same  and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples and especially to the best of those acquainted with him plotinus origen and their successorshierocles in photius bibl cod 251 from karamanolis g 2006 plato and aristotle in agreement platonists on aristotle from antiochus to porphyry page 193 oxford university press  blockquote
according to  a  and  c 400  ammonius held that the  was immaterialnemesius on the nature of man ii 
little is known about ammoniuss role in the development of  porphyry seems to suggest that ammonius was instrumental in helping plotinus think about philosophy in new ways
blockquotebut he plotinus did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration and brought the mind of ammonius to bear on the investigation in hand name porphyry1  blockquote
two of ammoniuss students    and    seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to  than neoplatonism which perhaps suggests that ammoniuss doctrines were also closer to those of middle platonism than the neoplatonism developed by plotinus see the  but plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master

the book of amos is a prophetic book of the  one of the   an older contemporary of  and  name  harris understanding the bible palo alto mayfield 1985  was active c 750 bc during the reign of  name harris  786–746 bc making the book of amos the first biblical prophetic book written amos lived in the  but preached in the northern  name harris  his major themes of  gods  and  became staples of prophecy name harris 
amos was a  see  during the reign of jeroboam ben joash  ruler of  from 793 bc to 753 bc and the reign of  king of  at a time when both kingdoms israel in the north and judah in the south were peaking in prosperity he was a contemporary of the prophet  but likely preceded him many of the earlier accounts of prophets found in the  are found within the context of other accounts of israels history amos however is the first prophet whose name also serves as the title of the corresponding biblical book in which his story is found
amos made it a point that before his calling he was a simple  and that he was not a professional prophet of the prophetic guild but modern scholarship points out that he was educated literate and likely an affluent land owner rather than a small shepherd name oyc 
the book was probably updated by later editors who added material concerning the fall of  to the  which had not yet happened in amoss lifetime the passages concerning this event can be distinguished stylistically from the older parts of the text
 prophesied in the days of uzziah king of judah and jeroboam son of joash king of israel this would place his ministry between 767 and 753 bc but a historically verifiable earthquake happened two years after he began to preach and so it is possible to place amoss ministry more precisely between about 765 and 760 bc 
leading up to this time assyrian armies battled against  for a number of years which greatly diminished syrias threat to  as a result of the fighting amongst its neighbors israel had the benefit of increasing its borders almost to those of the time of  and 
it should also be noted that amos preached about two years before a very large earthquake and made erence to it twice in his book   145b remembers this earthquake over 200 years later
some scholars believe that amos message was recorded after he delivered it to the northern kingdom upon returning to his southern homeland of  a town eight kilometres south of  it is mentioned many times in the   1539  149 and 2326 and  1128  is reported to have fortified tekoa along with other cities in  in  115–6
there are some differing opinions as to the location of the tekoa amos was presumably from it is believed by most that amos was a southern farmer who chose to deliver his prophetic message in the north however some believe that amos was actually from a tekoa in the north near  they believe that it is more probable that amos was from the north because it has conditions more suitable for the cultivation of sycamore figs than the tekoa of the south sycamore figs grow at a low elevation lower than the tekoa of judah which is at a relatively high elevation of 850 metres overlooking both  and  others have discredited the theory about the galilean tekoa citing that the difference in elevation between the two locations is not significant scholars in support of the idea of amos being from the north also say it makes more sense because of  accusation of conspiracy found in chapter seven verse 10 a conspirator they argue is more likely to be a national
two other opinions of where amos writings were recorded deserve mention they are that 1 disciples of amos followed him and recorded his message and 2 that someone in his audience in the north recorded his message
amos prophesies in a dramatic tone against common crimes and injustices such as bribery and greed the wealthy elite amos laments are becoming rich at the expense of others peasant farmers who once practiced subsistence farming are being forced to farm what is best for foreign trade mostly wine and oil amos 66 as  has observed the book elevates social justice and morality above cultic practice and ritual observance but unlike later prophets amos does not fully reject the  cult meaning that his views are similar to those of the 
god speaks to amos a farmer and herder and tells him to go to  the capital of the northern kingdom through amos god tells the people that he is going to judge israel for its sins and it will be a foreign nation that will enact his judgment
the people understand judgment as the coming of the day of the  the day of the  was widely celebrated and highly anticipated by the followers of god however amos came to tell the people that the day of the  was coming soon and that it meant divine judgment and justice for their own iniquity

in the first two visions  is able to convince god not to act out the scenes of discipline presented to him the ideas of discipline and justice although not enacted here correspond to the central message in what some er to as the book of woes 51 to 614 this message can be seen most clearly in verse 24 of chapter five the plagues in the preceding chapter chapter four were supposed to be seen as acts of discipline that turned israel back to god however the people did not interpret the acts this way and the discipline turned into judgment for the peoples disobedience in the second set of visions 77–9 there is no intercession by amos and god says that he will never pass by them again the plight of israel has become hopeless  will not hold back judgment because israel uses to listen to the prophets and even goes so far as to try to silence them 212 38 710–17
the central idea of the book of amos is that god puts his people on the same level as the surrounding nations – god expects the same purity of them all as it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of god even israel and judah will not be exempt from the judgment of god because of their idolatry and unjust ways the nation that represents yhwh must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of god gods name must be exalted
other major ideas in the book of amos include  and concern for the disadvantaged  the idea that israels  with god did not exempt them from accountability for sin  god is god of all nations  god is judge of all nations  god is god of moral righteousness  god made all people  god elected israel and then liberated israel so that he would be known throughout the world  election by god means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the covenant  if god destroys the unjust a remnant will remain  and god is free to judge whether to redeem israel

the city was not immediately incorporated into the macedonian kingdom and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy the border of macedonia was not moved further east however philip sent a number of macedonian governors to amphipolis and in many respects the city was effectively macedonianized nomenclature the calendar and the currency the  created by philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the pangaion hills replaced the amphipolitan  were all replaced by macedonian equivalents in the reign of  amphipolis was an important naval base and the birthplace of three of the most famous macedonian admirals  androstheneshttps  booksgooglecom booksum 1ampq androsthenes+thasosampbtng search+books  and  whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of amphipolis
the importance of the city in this period is shown by alexander the greats decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing 1500 talents were built alexander prepared for campaigns here against thrace in 335bc and the his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of asia the port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in asia after alexanders death his wife roxane and their small son alexander iv were exiled by  and later murdered here
throughout macedonian sovereignty amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance as shown by inscriptions amphipolis became one of the main stops on the macedonian royal road as testified by a border stone found between  and amphipolis giving the distance to the latter and later on the  the principal  which crossed the southern balkans apart from the ramparts of the lower town the  and a set of well preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible though little is known of the layout of the town modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation including a military ordinance of  and an  law from the gymnasium

the  of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back country amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis the ramparts were maintained to a certain extent thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans around the middle of the 7th century ad a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments the acropolis the  and especially the episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall
the city was probably abandoned in the eighth century as the last bishop was attested in 787 its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient eion port of amphipolis which had been rebuilt and ortified in the   under the name “chrysopolis” this small port continued to enjoy some prosperity before being abandoned during the  the last recorded sign of activity in the region of amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by the  john and the  alexios to protect the land that they had given to the  on

anaximenes of    c 585 – c 528 bce was an    active in the latter half of the 6th century bc name lindberg28lindberg david c “the greeks and the cosmos” the beginnings of western science chicago university of chicago press 2007  28  name grahamgraham daniel w anaximenes the internet encyclopedia of philosophy 29102009 http  wwwieputmedu anaximen  one of the three  philosophers he is identified as a younger friend or student of kirk gs je raven and m schofield  anaximenes of miletus  the presocratic philosophers  cambridge cambridge university press 1984  143  name guthrie115guthrie wkc  the milesians anaximenes  a history of greek philosophy  cambridge cambridge university press 1962 115  anaximenes like others in his school of thought practiced  name lindberg2believed in atheism9lindberg david c the greeks and the cosmos the beginnings of western science chicago university of chicago press 2007  29  name guthrie115  this tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what anaximenes is principally known for today
while his predecessors  and anaximander proposed that the   arche meaning the underlying material of the world were water and the ambiguous substance  respectively anaximenes asserted that air was this primary substance of which all other things are made it should be noted that anaximenes idea of air or aer is more like a dense mist that what we think of as air which is ideally transparent  the choice of air may seem arbitrary but anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of  and guthrie wkc the milesians anaximenes a history of greek philosophy cambridge cambridge university press 1962 116  when air condenses it becomes visible as mist and then rain and other forms of precipitation as the condensed air cools anaximenes supposed that it went on to form earth and ultimately stones in contrast water evaporates into air  can see how he thought that the water disappears   which ignites and produces flame  but what is this supposed to be based on   when further raied name guthrie124guthrie wkc the milesians anaximenes a history of greek philosophy cambridge cambridge university press 1962 124 126   while other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter anaximenes was the first to associate the quality pairs hot dry and cold wet with the density of a single material and add a quantitative dimension to the milesian  name guthrie124 kirk gs je raven and m schofield anaximenes of miletus the presocratic philosophers cambridge cambridge university press 1984 146 
having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air anaximenes used his theory to devise a scheme that explains the origins and nature of the earth and the surrounding celestial bodies  air felted to create the flat disk of the earth which he said was table like and behaved like a leaf floating on air in keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that raied ignited and became the stars while the sun is similarly described as being aflame it is not composed of raied air like the stars but rather of earth like the moon its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motionkirk gs je raven and m schofield anaximenes of miletus the presocratic philosophers cambridge cambridge university press 1984  152 153  similarly he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air in his theory when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head name graham fairbanks arthur http  peoplecsuchicagoedu ~simon teach 28000 davisuniversalpdf anaximenes the first philosophers of greece k paul trench trübner 1898 20 
anaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well  he asserted were the result either of lack of moisture which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is or of superabundance of water which also causes cracks in the earth in either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks so that hills collapse and cause earthquakes  is similarly caused by the violent separation of clouds by the wind creating a bright fire like flash  on the other hand are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sunfairbanks arthur  http  peoplecsuchicagoedu ~simon teach 28000 davisuniversalpdf anaximenes the first philosophers of greece k paul trench trübner 1898 1820 21   these examples show how anaximenes like the other  looked for the broader picture in nature they sought unifying causes for diversely occurring events rather than treating each one on a case by case basis or attributing them to gods or to a personified  name lindberg2believed in atheism9

andocides http  wwwinfopleasecom encyclopedia people andocideshtml andocides  6th ed columbia university press 2012   andokides c 440 – c 390 bc was a  speech writer in ancient greece  he was one of the ten  included in the alexandrian canon compiled by  and  in the third century bc
andocides was the son of leogoras and was born in  around 440 bcebrills new pauly vandocides  he belonged to the ancient  family of the  who traced their lineage up to  and the god  name pseudo   name pa alcibiades 21 andocides de mysteriis § 141 andocides de reditu § 26  
in his youth he seems to have been employed on various occasions as ambassador to      and andocides contra alcibiadem § 41  and although he was frequently attacked for his political opinionsandocides contra alcibiadem § 8  he maintained his ground until in  when he became involved in the charge brought against  for having profaned the mysteries and mutilated the  on the eve of the departure of the  against  it appeared particularly likely that andocides was an accomplice in the latter of these crimes which was believed to be a preliminary step towards overthrowing the democratic constitution since the herm standing close to his house in the  aegeis was among the very few which had not been injured alcibiades 3 jan otto sluiter lectiones andocideae c 3 
andocides was accordingly seized and thrown into prison but after some time recovered his freedom by a promise that he would turn informer and reveal the names of the real perpetrators of the crime and on the suggestion of one charmides or timaeusandocides de mysteriis § 48  name pa  he mentioned four all of whom were put to death he is said to have also denounced his own father on the charge of profaning the mysteries but to have rescued him again in the hour of danger   a charge he strenuously deniedandocides de mysteriis  but as andocides was unable to clear himself from the charge he was deprived of his rights as a citizen and left athensandocides de reditu § 25 
he now traveled about in various parts of greece and was chiefly engaged in commercial enterprise and in forming connections with powerful peopleandocides de mysteriis § 137  the means he employed to gain the friendship of powerful men were sometimes of the most disreputable kind among which a service he rendered to a prince in  is mentioned in particular name phot  
in  andocides returned to athens on the establishment of the  government of the  hoping that a certain service  he had rendered the athenian ships at samos would secure him a welcome receptionandocides de reditu §§ 1112  but no sooner were the oligarchs informed of the return of andocides than their leader  had him seized and accused him of having supported the party opposed to them at samos during his trial andocides who perceived the exasperation prevailing against him leaped to the altar which stood in the court and there assumed the attitude of a supplicant this saved his life but he was imprisoned soon afterwards however he was set free or escaped from prisonandocides de reditu § 15  name lysias29 against andocides § 29 
andocides now went to cyprus where for a time he enjoyed the friendship of  but by some circumstance or other he exasperated his friend and was consigned to prison here again he escaped and after the restoration of democracy in athens and the abolition of the four hundred he ventured once more to return to athens but as he was still suffering under a sentence of civil disenfranchisement he endeavored by means of bribes to persuade the  to allow him to attend the assembly of the people the latter however expelled him from the city name lysias29  it was on this occasion  that andocides delivered the speech still extant on his return on which he petitioned for permission to reside at athens but in vain in his third exile andocides went to reside in  name phot  and during the time of his absence from his native city his house there was occupied by  the leading andocides de mysteriis § 146 
andocides remained in exile until after the overthrow of the tyranny of  by  when the general amnesty then proclaimed made him hope that its benefit would be extended to him also he himself says that he returned to athens from cyprusandocides de mysteriis § 132  where he claimed to have great influence and considerable propertyandocides de mysteriis § 4  because of the general amnesty he was allowed to remain at athens enjoyed peace for the next three years and soon recovered an influential position according to  it was scarcely ten days after his return that he brought an accusation against  or  which however he dropped on receiving a sum of money during this period andocides became a member of the  in which he appears to have possessed a great influence as well as in the popular assembly he was  at the  was sent as  to the  and  and was even entrusted with the office of keeper of the sacred treasury
but in   supported by    and  urged the necessity of preventing andocides from attending the assembly as he had never been formally freed from the civil disenfranchisement callias also charged him with violating the laws respecting the temple at andocides de mysteriis § 110  the orator pleaded his case in the oration still extant on the mysteries περὶ τῶν μυστηρίων in which he argued that he had not been involved in the profanation of the mysteries or the mutilation of the herms that he had not violated the laws of the temple at eleusis that anyway he had received his citizenship back as a result of the amnesty and that callias was really motivated by a private dispute with andocides over inheritance he was acquitted after this he again enjoyed peace until  he was sent as ambassador to  respecting the peace to be concluded in consequence of s victory off  on his return he was accused of illegal conduct during his embassy the speech on the peace with the lacedaemons περὶ τῆς πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους εἰρήνης which is still extant ers to this affair it was delivered in  though some scholars place it in  andocides was found guilty and sent into exile for the fourth time he never returned afterwards and seems to have died soon after this blow
andocides appears to have fathered no children since he is described at the age of 70 as being childlessandocides de mysteriis §§ 146148  although the  on  mentions  as a son of andocides the large fortune which he had inherited from his father or acquired in his commercial undertakings was greatly diminished in the latter years of his lifeandocides de mysteriis § 144  against andocides § 31 
as an orator andocides does not appear to have been held in very high esteem by the ancients as he is seldom mentioned though  is said to have written a commentary on his orations sv Θέων  we do not hear of his having been trained in any of the sophistical schools of the time and he had probably developed his talents in the practical school of the popular assembly hence his orations have no mannerism in them and are really as plutarch says simple and free from all rhetorical pomp and ornamentcomp dionys hal de lys 2 de thucyd jud 51 
sometimes however his style is diffuse and becomes tedious and obscure the best among his orations is that on the mysteries but for the history of the time all are of the highest importance
besides the three orations already mentioned which are undoubtedly genuine there is a fourth against alcibiades κατὰ Ἀλκιβιάδου said to have been delivered by andocides during the  of  but it is probably spurious though it appears to contain genuine historical matter some scholars ascribed it to  who took part in the ostracism according to plutarch but it is more likely that it is a rhetorical exercise from the early fourth century bc since formal speeches were not delivered during ostracisms and the accusation or defence of alcibiades was a standing rhetorical themegribble 1999 alcibiades and athens ch2 app2  besides these four orations we possess only a few fragments and some very vague allusions to other orationsjan otto sluiter lectiones andocideae p 239 ampc

despite the fact that andrew did not stop conspiring against emeric the dying king made andrew guardian of his son  in 1204 after the premature death of ladislaus andrew ascended the throne in 1205 according to historian lászló kontler it was amindst the socio political turmoil during andrews reign that the relations arrangements institutional framework and social categories that arose under stephen i started to disintegrate in the higher echelons of society in hungary andrew introduced a new grants policy the so called new institutions giving away money and royal estates to his partisans despite the loss of royal revenues he was the first hungarian monarch to adopt the title of king of halych and  he waged at least a dozen wars to seize the two  but the local s and neighboring princes prevented him from conquering the principalities he participated in the  to the holy land in 1217–1218 but the crusade was a failure
when the  or royal servants rose up andrew was forced to issue the  confirming their privileges this led to the rise of the  his  of 1224 listed the liberties of the  community the employment of  and  to administer the royal revenues led him into conflict with the  and the hungarian s andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non christian officials in 1233 but he never fulfilled the latter promise
andrews first wife  was murdered in 1213 because her blatant favoritism towards her german kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords the veneration of their daughter  was confirmed by the holy see during andrews lifetime after andrews death his sons  and  accused his third wife  of adultery and never considered her son  to be a legitimate son of andrew
andrew was the second son of king  and bélas first wife  the year of andrews birth is not known but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177 andrew was first mentioned in connection to his fathers invasion of the  in 1188 that year béla iii invaded halych upon the request of its former prince  who had been expelled by his subjects béla forced the new prince  to flee after conquering halych he granted it to andrew béla also captured vladimir yaroslavich and imprisoned him in hungary
after bélas withdrawal from halych roman mstislavich returned with the assistance of  prince of  they tried to expel andrew and his hungarian retinue but the hungarians routed the united forces of mstislavich and rostislavich a group of local s offered the throne to rostislav ivanovich a distant cousin of the imprisoned vladimir yaroslavich béla iii sent reinforcements to halych enabling andrews troops to repel the attacks andrews reign remained unpopular in halych because the hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect  churches consequently the local boyars allied with their former prince vladimir yaroslavich who had escaped from captivity and returned to halych duke  also supported vladimir yaroslavich and they expelled andrew and his retinue from the principality in august 1189 or 1190 andrew returned to hungary after his defeat he did not receive a separate duchy from his father who only gave him estates and money on his deathbed béla iii who had pledged to lead a  to the  ordered andrew to fulfill his vow andrews father died on 23 april 1196 and andrews older brother  succeeded him
andrew used the funds that he inherited from his father to recruit supporters among the hungarian lords he also formed an alliance with  and they plotted against emeric their united troops routed the royal army at  slavonia in december 1197 under duress king emeric gave  and  to andrew as an appanage in practice andrew administered croatia and dalmatia as an independent monarch he minted coins granted land and confirmed privileges he cooperated with the   and other local lords the  settled in the province during his rule taking advantage of s death andrew invaded  and occupied at least the land between the  and  rivers he styled himself by the grace of god duke of zadar and of all dalmatia croatia and hum in his charters
 urged andrew to lead a crusade the holy land but andrew hatched a new conspiracy against emeric with the help of john abbot of pannonhalma  and many other prelates and lords the pope threatened him with  if he failed to fulfill his fathers vow but andrew did not yield the conspiracy was uncovered on 10 march 1199 when king emeric seized letters written by andrews partisans to bishop boleslaus that summer royal troops routed andrews army near  and andrew fled to austria a papal legate mediated a reconciliation between andrew and emeric who allowed andrew to return to croatia and dalmatia in 1200 andrew married  her father  owned extensive domains in the  along the borders of andrews duchy
when emerics son  was born around 1200 andrews hopes to succeed his brother as king were shattered pope innocent confirmed the childs position as heir to the crown declaring that andrews future sons would only inherit andrews duchy andrew planned a new rebellion against his brother but king emeric captured him without resistance near  in october 1203
andrew was first imprisoned in the fort of  then in  alexander of the  clan freed him in early 1204 having fallen ill king emeric had his son ladislaus crowned king on 26 august andrew reconciled with his dying brother who entrusted him with the guardianship of his son and the administration of the entire kingdom until the ward should reach the age of majorityarchdeacon thomas of split history of the bishops of salona and split ch 23 p 143  according to the nearly contemporaneous 
king emeric died on 30 november 1204 andrew governed the kingdom as ladislauss regent but he counted his regnal years from the time of his brothers death showing that he already regarded himself as the lawful monarch during ladislaus iiis reign pope innocent told andrew that he should remain loyal to ladislaus instead andrew seized the money that emeric had deposited for ladislaus in  ladislauss mother  fled from hungary taking her son to  andrew prepared to war against  but ladislaus suddenly died in  on 7 may 1205

during his reign andrew was intensely interested in the internal affairs of his former principality of halych he launched his first campaign to recapture halych in 1205 or 1206 upon the boyars request he intervened against   and his allies on behalf of  the child prince of halych and  svyatoslavich and his allies were forced to withdraw andrew adopted the title of king of galicia and lodomeria demonstrating his claim to suzerainty in the two principalities

a group of boyars who were alarmed by the despotic acts of vladimir igorevich asked andrew to restore daniel romanovich as ruler of halych in 1210 or 1211 andrew and his alliesleszek i of poland and at least five rus princessent their armies to halych and restored daniel romanovich local boyars expelled daniel romanovichs mother in 1212 she persuaded andrew to personally lead his army to halych he captured volodislav kormilchich the most influential boyar and took him to hungary after andrew withdrew from halych the boyars again offered the throne to mstislav mstislavich who expelled daniel romanovich and his mother from the principality andrew departed for a new campaign against halych in summer 1213 during his absence hungarian lords who were aggrieved at queen gertrudes favoritism towards her german entourage captured and murdered her and many of her courtiers in the  on 28 september when he heard of her murder andrew returned to hungary and ordered the execution of the murderer  however peters accomplices including   did not receive severe punishments a group of hungarian lords whom andrew called perverts in one of his letters was plotting to dethrone andrew and crown his eldest son the eight year old  but they failed to dethrone him and could only force andrew to consent to bélas coronation in 1214
andrew and leszek of poland signed a treaty of alliance which obliged andrews second son  to marry leszek of polands daughter  andrew and leszek jointly invaded halych in 1214 and coloman was made prince he agreed to cede  to leszek of poland the following year andrew returned to halych and captured  leszek of poland soon reconciled with mstislav mstislavich they jointly invaded halych and forced coloman to flee to hungary a new officer of state the  was responsible for the administration of the royal chamber from around 1214 onwards however royal revenues had significantly diminished upon the advice of the treasurer  andrew imposed new taxes and   from minting salt trade and custom duties the yearly exchange of coins also produced more revenue for the royal chamber however these measures provoked discontent in hungary
andrew signed a new treaty of alliance with leszek of poland in the summer of 1216 leszek and andrews son coloman invaded halych and expelled mstislav mstislavich and daniel romanovich after which coloman was restored that same year andrew met   in  now  serbia he persuaded stephen nemanjić to negotiate with   who was the uncle of andrews second wife  stephen nemanjić was crowned king of serbia in 1217 andrew planned to invade serbia but stephen nemanjićs brother  dissuaded him according to both versions of the life of sava
in july 1216 the newly elected  once again called upon andrew to fulfill his fathers vow to lead a crusade andrew who had postponed the crusade at least three times in 1201 1209 and 1213 finally agreed  tibor almási and other modern historians say that andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as latin emperor of constantinople because his wifes uncle emperor henry had died in june according to a letter written by pope honorius in 1217 envoys from the  had actually informed andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father in law  as emperor the barons of the latin empire elected peter of courtenay in the summer of 1216
andrew sold and mortgaged royal estates to finance his campaign which became part of the wider  he renounced his claim to zadar in favor of the republic of venice so that he could secure shipping for his army he entrusted hungary to archbishop john of esztergom and gave croatia and dalmatia to  the  prior of vrana in july 1217 andrew departed from  accompanied by  and  his army was so largeat least 10000 mounted soldiers and uncountable infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when andrew and his men embarked in split two months later the ships transported them to  where they landed in october
the leaders of the crusade included   leopold of austria the  the  and the  they held a war council in acre with andrew leading the meeting in early november the crusaders launched a campaign for the  forcing   to withdraw without fighting the crusaders then pillaged  after the crusaders returned to acre andrew did not participate in any other military actions instead he was collecting s including a water jug allegedly used at the  the heads of  and  the right hands of the apostles  and  and a part of  if thomas the archdeacons report of certain evil and audacious men in acre who treacherously passed him a poisoned drink name autogenerated165archdeacon thomas of split history of the bishops of salona and split ch 25 p 165  is reliable andrews inactivity was because of illness
andrew decided to return home at the very beginning of 1218 even though   threatened him with excommunication andrew first visited  and participated in the marriage of  and  on 10 january from tripoli he travelled to  where he and  betrothed andrews youngest son  and leos daughter  andrew proceeded through the   before arriving in  now  turkey his cousins the sons of his uncle géza attacked him when he was in nicaea he arranged the marriage of his oldest son béla to  a daughter of emperor  when he arrived in bulgaria andrew was detained until he gave full surety that his daughter would be united in marriage name autogenerated165  to  according to thomas the archdeacon andrew returned to hungary in late 1218 andrews crusade had achieved nothing and brought him no honor according to historian thomas c van cleve oliver of padernborn  and other 13th century authors blamed andrew for the failure of crusade
when he returned to hungary andrew complained to pope honorius that his kingdom was in a miserable and destroyed state deprived of all of its revenues  a group of barons had even expelled archbishop john from hungary andrew was in massive debt because of his crusade which forced him to impose extraordinarily high taxes and debase coinage in 1218 or 1219 mstislav mstislavich invaded halych and captured andrews son coloman andrew compromised with mstislavich coloman was released and andrews youngest son and namesake was betrothed to mstislavichs daughter in 1220 a group of lords persuaded andrew to make his eldest son béla the duke of croatia dalmatia and slavonia
andrew employed  and  to administer royal revenues which caused a discord between andrew and the holy see starting in the early 1220s pope honorius urged andrew and queen yolanda to prohibit muslims from employing christians andrew confirmed the privileges of clergymen including their exemption from taxes and  but also prohibited the  of   and other serfs in early 1222 however a new conflict emerged between andrew and the holy see after he persuaded béla to separate from his wife maria laskarina an immense crowd approached andrew around june 1222 demanding grave and unjust things according to a letter of pope honorius  actually the who were landowners directly subject to the monarchs power and obliged to fight in the royal armyassembled forcing andrew to dismiss  and his other officials andrew was also forced issue a royal charter the  the charter summarized the liberties of the royal servants including their exemption from taxes and the jurisdiction of the s the last clause of the golden bull authorized the bishops as well as the other barons and nobles of the realm singularly and in common to resist the monarch if he did not honor the provisions of the charter the golden bull clearly distinguished the royal servants from the kings other subjects which led to the rise of the   the golden bull is commonly compared with englands  — a similar charter which was sealed a few years earlier in 1215  a significant difference between them is that in england the settlement strengthened the position of all the royal subjects but in hungary the aristocracy came to dominate both the crown and the lower orders
andrew discharged palatine  and restored julius kán in the second half of 1222 the following year pope honorius urged andrew to launch a new crusade if the report of the continuatio claustroneuburgensis is reliable andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade but no other sources mention this event andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son béla but pope honorius mediated a reconciliation between béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223 this angered andrew and béla fled to austria he returned in 1224 after the bishops persuaded andrew to forgive him
in his  of 1224 andrew confirmed the privileges of the  who inhabited the region of  in southern transylvania now  romania the following year he launched a campaign against the teutonic knights who had attempted to eliminate his suzerainty the knights were forced to leave  and the neighboring lands andrews envoys and leopold vi of austria signed a treaty on 6 june which ended the armed conflicts along the hungarian austrian border as part of the treaty leopold vi paid an indemnification for the damages that his troops had caused in hungary andrew made his oldest son béla  bélas former duchy was given to andrews second son coloman in 1226 duke béla started expanding his suzerainty over the  who inhabited the lands east of the carpathian mountains andrew launched a campaign against mstislav mstislavich in 1226 because the latter used to grant halych to andrews youngest son despite a previous compromise andrew besieged and captured   and other fortresses in halych however his troops were routed at  and zvenigorod forcing him to withdraw despite his victories mstislavich ceded halych to andrews son in early 1227
in 1228 andrew authorized his son béla to revise his previous land grants pope honorius also supported bélas efforts béla confiscated the domains of two noblemen  and bánk bár kalán who had taken part in the conspiracy to murder queen gertrude in 1229 upon bélas proposal andrew confirmed the privileges of the cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to béla  made a complaint about andrew to the holy see because andrew continued to employ jews and muslims  authorized the archbishop to perform acts of religious censure to persuade andrew to dismiss his non christian officials under duress andrew issued a new golden bull in 1231 which confirmed that muslims were banned from employment and empowered the archbishop of esztergom to excommunicate the king if he failed to honor the provisions of the new golden bull in the second half of the year andrew invaded halych and restored his youngest son andrew to the throne
archbishop robert excommunicated palatine denis and put hungary under an  on 25 february 1232 because the employment of jews and muslims continued despite the golden bull of 1231 since the archbishop accused the muslims of persuading andrew to seize church property andrew restored properties to the archbishop who soon suspended the interdict upon andrews demand pope gregory sent cardinal  as his legate to hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the popes special authorization although andrew departed for halych to support his youngest son in a fight against daniel romanivich he continued his negotiations with the papal legate on 20 august 1233 in the forests of  he vowed that he would not employ jews and muslims to administrate royal revenues and would pay 10000 marks as compensation for usurped church revenues andrew repeated his oath in  in september
andrew and  signed a peace treaty in late 1233 andrew who had been widowed married the 23 year old  on 14 may 1234 even though his sons were sharply opposed to his third marriage john bishop of bosnia put hungary under a new interdict in the first half of 1234 because andrew had not dismissed his non christian officials despite his oath of bereg andrew and archbishop robert of esztergom protested against the bishops act at the holy see
danilo romanovich laid siege to halych and andrews youngest son died during the siege in the autumn of 1234 however andrew stormed austria in the summer of 1235 forcing duke frederick to pay an indemnification for damages that his troops had caused while raiding hungary upon andrews demand pope gregory declared on 31 august that andrew and his sons could only be excommunicated by the authorization of the holy see andrew died on 21 september and was buried in

an enquiry concerning human understanding is a book by the scottish    published in english in 1748see  via google books  it was a revision of an earlier effort humes  published anonymously in  in 173940 hume was disappointed with the reception of the treatise which fell dead born from the presshume david 1776 my own life appendix a of  the life of david hume university of texas press 1954  as he put it and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work
the end product of his labours was the enquiry the enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the treatise in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects for example humes views on  do not appear however more vital propositions such as humes argument for the role of  in a theory of knowledge are retained
this book has proven highly influential both in the years that would immediately follow and today   points to it as the book which woke him from his self described dogmatic slumberi    the enquiry is widely regarded as a classic in  literature
the argument of the enquiry proceeds by a series of incremental steps separated into chapters which logically succeed one another after expounding his  hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics
 
in the first section of the enquiry hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole for hume philosophy can be split into two general parts natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature or as he calls it moral philosophy the latter investigates both actions and thoughts he emphasizes in this section by way of warning that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion however he insists precision helps art and craft of all kinds including the craft of philosophy
 
next hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas by impressions he means sensations while by ideas he means memories and imaginings according to hume the difference between the two is that ideas are less vivacious than impressions for example the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression or sensation of actually eating one writing within the tradition of  he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas
hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensationin lockes terminology this was known as the division between simple and complex ideas of sense  according to hume the creative faculty makes use of at least four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense impressions these operations are compounding or the addition of one idea onto another such as a horn on a horse to create a  transposing or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a  augmenting as with the case of a  whose size has been augmented and diminishing as with  whose size has been diminished hume 1974317 in a later chapter he also mentions the operations of mixing separating and dividing hume 1974340 
however hume admits that there is one objection to his account the problem of  in this thought experiment he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one see fig 1 he predicts that this man will be able to divide the color of this particular shade of blue despite the fact that he has never experienced it this seems to pose a serious problem for the empirical account though hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions hume 1974319
 
in this chapter hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences as in trains of thought he explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas resemblance contiguity in space time and cause and effect he argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas however he does not immediately show what this principle might be hume 1974320 321
 
in the first part hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either relations of ideas or matters of fact which is roughly the  between  and  the former he tells the reader are proved by demonstration while the latter are given through experience hume 1974322 in explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through  reasoning for hume every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily—they are entirely distinct from one another hume 1974324
in part two hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world
when it is asked what is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact the proper answer seems to be that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect when again it is asked what is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation it may be replied in one word experience but if we still carry on our sifting humor and ask what is the foundation of all conclusions from experience this implies a new question which may be of more difficult solution and explication hume 1974328
he shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration since it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change nor experience since that would be a  hume 1974330 332 here he is describing what would become known as the 
 
for hume we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of habit or custom which human nature forces us to take seriously this is also presumably the principle that organizes the connections between ideas indeed one of the many famous passages of the inquiry was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom in a later chapter he wrote
the great subverter of pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action and employment and the occupations of common life these principles may flourish and triumph in the schools where it is indeed difficult if not impossible to ute them but as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real objects which actuate our passions and sentiments are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals hume 1974425
in the second part he provides an account of beliefs he explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesnt hume 1974340
 
this short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance for him probability means a higher chance of occurring and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer by chance he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience however further experience takes these equal chances and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others these gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes this effect may be understood as another case of custom or habit taking past experience and using it to predict the future hume 1974346 348
 
by necessary connection hume means the power or force which necessarily ties one idea to another he rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined since that would mean we could know something prior to experience unlike his predecessors berkeley and locke hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of some sense of the power of the will he reasons that 1 if we knew the nature of this power then the mind body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us 2 if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies eg our hands or tongues and not others eg the liver or heart 3 we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action eg of the muscles and nerves and animal spirits which are the immediate cause of an action hume 1974353 354 he produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone hume 1974355 356 he also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere  a view associated with the philosopher  hume 1974356 359
having dispensed with these alternative explanations he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances in this way people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will hume 1974361
 
here hume tackles the problem of how  may be reconciled with metaphysical  otherwise known as a  formulation of  hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments—that is to say arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions he first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic but human actions are more controversial however he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system to show the compatibility of  necessity and liberty hume defines liberty as the ability to act on the basis of ones will eg the capacity to will ones actions but not to will ones will he then shows quite briefly how determinism and free will are compatible notions and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life
 
hume insists that the conclusions of the enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans he believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do through learned expectations hume 1974384 he also notes that this inferential ability that animals have is not through reason but custom alone hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share namely the ability to reason experimentally through custom nevertheless he admits humans and animals differ in mental faculties in a number of ways including differences in memory and attention inferential abilities ability to make deductions in a long chain ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances a sagely prudence which arrests generalizations a capacity for a greater inner library of analogies to reason with an ability to detach oneself and scrap ones own biases and an ability to converse through language and thus gain from the experience of others testimonies hume 1974385 footnote 17
 
the next topic which hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony and of the role that  this was not an idle concern for hume depending on its outcome the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles
true to his empirical thesis hume tells the reader that though testimony does have some force it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses that said he provides some reasons why we may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons because a human memory can be relatively tenacious and b because people are inclined to tell the truth and ashamed of telling falsities needless to say these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience hume 1974389
and there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony also based on experience if a testimonies conflict one another b there are a small number of witnesses c the speaker has no integrity d the speaker is overly hesitant or bold or e the speaker is known to have motives for lying then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speakers claims hume 1974390
there is one final criterion that hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony and that is f if the propositions being communicated are miraculous hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature he argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them and are so well demonstrated to everyones experience that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence hume 1974391 392
moreover he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity for four reasons first he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts second he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others third he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism finally since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous—that is one mans religious miracle may be contradicted by another mans miracle—any testimony relating to the fantastic is self denunciating hume 1974393 398
still hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform however he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity thus if every historian were to claim that there was a solar eclipse in the year 1600 then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws wed come to accept it as a fact but if every historian were to assert that queen elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead then wed have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation hume 1974400 402
 
hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell the brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions not of hume but of one of humes anonymous friends who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher  his friend argues that though it is possible to  it is not possible to infer unseen effects from a cause thus traced the friend insists then that even though we might postulate that there is a first cause behind all things—god—we cant infer anything about the afterlife because we dont know anything of the afterlife from experience and we cant infer it from the existence of god hume 1974408
hume offers his friend an objection if we see an unfinished building then cant we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions and that it will be finished in the future his friend concurs but indicates that there is a relevant disanalogy that we cant pretend to know the contents of the mind of god while we can know the designs of other humans hume seems essentially persuaded by his friends reasoning hume 1974412 414
 
the first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments the treatment includes the arguments of atheism cartesian skepticism light skepticism and rationalist critiques of empiricism hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which   while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable   may only be combated through the non philosophical adherence to custom or habit he ends the section with his own reservations towards cartesian and lockean epistemologies
in the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it
for here is the chief and most confounding objection to excessive skepticism that no durable good can ever result from it while it remains in its full force and vigor we need only ask such a skeptic what his meaning is and what he proposes by all these curious researches he is immediately at a loss and knows not what to answer a pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind or if it had that its influence would be beneficial to society on the contrary he must acknowledge if he will acknowledge anything that all human life must perish were his principles universally and steadily to prevail hume 1974426
he concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number no does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusionhume d enquiries concerning human understanding and concerning the principles of morals reprinted from 1777 edition third edition l a selby bigge ed clarendon press oxford sect xii part iii p165 
the criteria hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology under the rubric of the communication persuasion paradigm supporting literature includes the work of  which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator  in different kinds of persuasion and examinations of the worthiness of the speaker
the custom view of learning can in many ways be likened to  psychology this point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century still testing on the subject has been somewhat divided testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect however it has been shown that some animals like chimpanzees were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals and thus would seem to have a causal insight which transcends mere customkohler wolfgang 1925 the mentality of apes new york harcourt cited from passer michael et al 2003 psychology frontiers and applications first canadian edition mcgraw hill toronto p 267

andronikos i komnenos  ampnbsp september 12 1185 usually  as andronicus i comnenus was  from 1183 to 1185 he was the son of  and the grandson of the emperor 
andronikos komnenos was born around 1118 he was handsome and eloquent active hardy courageous a great general and an able politician but also licentious his early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service
in 1141 he was taken captive by the  and remained in their hands for a year on being ransomed he went to  where he was held at the court of his cousin the emperor  to whom he was a great favourite here the charms of his niece eudoxia attracted him and she became his mistress in 1152 accompanied by eudoxia he set out for an important command in   in his principal enterprise an attack upon  he returned but was again appointed to the command of a province  this second post he seems also to have left after a short interval for he appeared again in constantinople and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of eudoxia
about 1153 a conspiracy against the emperor in which andronikos participated was discovered and he was thrown in prison after repeated unsuccessful attempts he escaped in 1165 after passing through many dangers including captivity in  territory he reached  where his cousin  of  held court while under the protection of yaroslav andronikos formed an alliance with the emperor manuel i and with a  army he joined manuel in the invasion of  assisting at the siege of  the campaign was successful and andronikos returned to constantinople with manuel i in 1168 a year later however andronikos used to take the oath of allegiance to the future king  whom manuel desired to become his successor andronikos was removed from court but received the province of 
still under the displeasure of the emperor andronikos fled to the court of   while residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince  sister of the empress  the emperor was again angered by this dishonour and andronikos was compelled to flee he took uge with king  whose favour he gained and who invested him with the  in jerusalem he saw  the beautiful widow of king  and niece of the emperor manuel although andronikos was at that time fifty six years old age had not diminished his charms and theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction to avoid the vengeance of the emperor she fled with andronikos to the court of  the  feeling unsafe there they continued their perilous journey through the  and  they were well received by king  whose anonymous sister had probably been the first wife of andronikos
andronikos was granted estates in  in the east of georgia in 1173 or 1174 he accompanied the georgian army on an expedition to  up to the  shores where george recaptured the fortress of shabaran from the invaders from  for his cousin the   finally andronikos and theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the komnenoi at  on the shores of the  between  and speros vryonis jr the decline of medieval hellenism in asia minor and the process of islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century berkeley university of california 1971 p 127  while andronikos was on one of his incursions into trebizond his castle was surprised by the governor of that province and theodora and her two children were captured and sent to constantinople to obtain their release andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the emperor and appearing in chains before him besought pardon this he obtained and he was allowed to retire with theodora into banishment at oinaion
in 1180 the emperor manuel died and was succeeded by his ten year old son  who was under the guardianship of his mother empress maria her latin origins and culture led to creeping resentment from her greek subjects they had felt insulted by the western tastes of manuel and being ruled by his western wife built tensions to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war this gave andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to constantinople with an army that according to non byzantine sources included muslim contingents

  the defection of the commander of the byzantine navy   and the general andronikos angelos played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter constantinople
the arrival of andronikos komnenos was soon followed by a  who virtually controlled its economy resulting in the deaths of thousands of westerners he was believed to have arranged the poisoning of alexios iis elder sister  and her husband  although maria herself had encouraged him to intervene the poisoner was said to be the  pterygeonites soon afterwards andronikos had the empress maria imprisoned and then killed — forcing a signature from the child emperor alexius to put his mother to death — by pterygeonites and the  constantine tripsychos alexios ii was compelled to acknowledge andronikos as colleague in the empire in front of the crowd on the terrace of the  and was then quickly put to death in turn the killing was carried out by tripsychos theodore dadibrenos and  histories pp 260–274 van dieten 
in 1183 andronikos married twelve year old   daughter of king  and his third wife  — agnes had been betrothed to alexios ii by november 1183 andronikos had associated his younger legitimate son john komnenos on the throne in 1184 a venetian embassy visited constantinople and an agreement was reached that compensation of 1500 gold pieces would be paid for the losses incurred in 1171
the reign of andronikos was characterized by his harsh measures he resolved to suppress many abuses but above all things to check  and limit the power of the nobles who were rivals for his throne the people who felt the severity of his laws at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of manuel is rule andronikos became increasingly paranoid and violent however and the empire descended into a terror state in september 1185 he ordered the execution of all prisoners exiles and their families for collusion with the invaders the aristocrats in turn were infuriated against him and there were several revolts
the stories of chaos led to an invasion by king  of the norman sicilians william landed in  with a strong force of 200 ships and 80000 men including 5000 knights and marched as far as  which he  ruthlessly 7000 greeks died andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the sicilian army from reaching constantinople but his forces failed to stand and retreated to the outlying hills andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the norman fleet from entering the  the invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor 
andronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy and his plans were nearly successful but on september 11 1185 during his absence from the capital stephen hagiochristophorites his lieutenant moved to arrest  whose loyalty was suspect  isaac killed hagiochristophorites and took uge in the church of  he appealed to the populace and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city
when andronikos arrived he found that isaac had been proclaimed emperor the deposed emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife agnes and his mistress but they were captured though some claim that andronikos survived and managed to escape to the then self proclaimed kingdom of  isaac handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten his right hand was cut off his teeth and hair were pulled out one of his eyes was gouged out and among many other sufferings boiling water was thrown in his face punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness at last he was led to the  and hung by his feet between two pillars two latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply and he was according to the representation of his death torn apartniketas choniates p 193  he died on september 12 1185 at the news of the emperors death his son and co emperor john was murdered by his own troops in

apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the   and the third intended to  the craft was launched on april 11 1970 at 1313  from the  but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later crippling the  sm upon which the  cm depended despite great hardship caused by limited power loss of cabin heat shortage of potable water and the critical need to  the carbon dioxide removal system the crew returned safely to  on april 17
the flight passed over the far side of the moon at an altitude of  from the lunar surface  400171 km 248655 mi from earth a  marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from earth  the mission was commanded by  with  as command module pilot and  as lunar module pilot swigert was a late replacement for the original cm pilot  who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to 
by the standard crew rotation in place during the apollo program the prime crew for apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for  with mercury and gemini veteran  in command that crew was composed of
 commander
 command module pilot
 lunar module pilot
 nasas director of flight crew operations never intended to rotate cooper and eisele to another mission as both were out of favor with nasa management for various reasons cooper for his lax attitude towards training and eisele for incidents aboard  and an extra marital  he assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight qualified manpower in the astronaut office at the time the assignment needed to be made name slayton  slayton felt cooper had a very small chance of receiving the apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment which he did not despite eiseles issues with management slayton always intended to assign him to a future  mission rather than a lunar mission but this program was eventually cut down to only the  component
thus the original assignment slayton submitted to his superiors for this flight was
 commander
 command module pilot
 lunar module pilot
for the first time ever slaytons recommendation was rejected by management who felt that shepard needed more time to train properly for a lunar flight as he had only recently benefited from experimental surgery to correct an  which had kept him grounded since  in 1961 thus lovells crew backup for the historic  mission and theore slated for  was swapped with shepards crew name slayton   and the original crew selection for the mission became
prime crew
backup crew
ken mattingly was originally intended as the command module pilot seven days before launch the backup lunar module pilot charlie duke contracted  from one of his children this exposed both the prime and backup crews who trained together  mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had rubella as a child and thus was not immune three days before launch at the insistence of the flight surgeon swigert was moved to the prime crew 
mattingly never contracted rubella and was assigned after the flight as command module pilot to youngs crew which later flew  the fifth mission to land on the moon

the mission was launched at the planned time 021300 pm  191300 utc on april 11 an anomaly occurred when the second stage center inboard engine shut down about two minutes early the four outboard engines and the third stage engine burned longer to compensate and the vehicle achieved very close to the planned circular   followed by a normal translunar injection about two hours later name lver   ch22 7 comments on apollo 13 pogo  the engine shutdown was determined to be caused by severe s measured at a strength of 68 g and a frequency of 16 hertz flexing the thrust frame by  the vehicles guidance system shut the engine down in response to sensed thrust chamber pressure fluctuations pogo oscillations had been seen on previous titan rockets and also on the saturn v during   but on apollo 13 they were amplified by an unexpected interaction with turbopump   later missions implemented anti pogo modifications that had been under development these included addition of a helium gas reservoir to the center engine  line to damp pressure oscillations an automatic cutoff as a backup and simplification of the propellant valves of all five second stage engines
the crew performed the separation and transposition maneuver to dock the command module odyssey to the  lm aquarius and pulled away from the spent third stage which ground controllers then sent on a course to impact the moon in range of a seismometer placed on surface by  they then settled in for the three day trip to fra mauro
approaching 56 hours into the mission apollo 13 was approximately  from earth en route to the moon name gatland   approximately six and a half minutes after the end of a live tv broadcast from the spacecraft haise was in the process of powering down the lm while lovell was stowing the tv camera and  flight controllers asked swigert to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans in the service module which were designed to destratify the  contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings almost two minutes later the astronauts heard a loud bang accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and firing of the attitude control thrusters name timeline   the crew initially thought that a  might have struck the lunar module communications and telemetry to earth were lost for 18 seconds until the system automatically corrected by switching the high gain  antenna used for translunar communications from narrow beam to wide beam mode name autopage 4 44 paragraph 2  http  ntrsnasagov archive nasa casintrsnasagov 19700076776pdf 
immediately after the bang lovell reported a main b bus undervolt a temporary loss of operating voltage on the second of the spacecrafts main electrical circuits oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero about three minutes later the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting a gas of some sort into space the number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes entirely depleting the sms oxygen supply name report  
because the fuel cells generated the command service modules electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water when oxygen tank 1 ran dry the remaining fuel cell finally shut down leaving the craft on the command modules limited duration battery power and water the crew was forced to shut down the cm completely to save this for re entry and to power up the lm to use as a lifeboat  this situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation but had not been considered a likely scenario  without the lm the accident would certainly have been fatal 
the damage to the service module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible so lead flight director  ordered an abort of the mission the existing abort plans first drawn up in 1966 were evaluated the quickest was a direct abort trajectory which required using the service module propulsion system sps engine to achieve a   name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 14 sup although a successful sps firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time get would land the crew one day earlier at 118 hours get or 58 hours later the large delta v was possible only if the lm were jettisoned first name   missionopreport suppampnbspii 1 sup and since crew survival depended on the lms presence during the coast back to earth that option was out of the question name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 17 sup an alternative would have been to burn the sps fuel to depletion then jettison the service module and make a second burn with the lm  dps engine it was desired to keep the service module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the command modules heat shield apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar  at 61 hours get which was the break even point between direct and circumlunar aborts and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn name   missionopreport supp b 5 sup there also was concern about the structural integrity of the service module name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii‑23 sup so mission planners were instructed that the sps engine would not be used except as a last ditch effort name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 14 sup
for these reasons kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option using the moons gravity to return the ship to earth apollo 13 had left its initial  earlier in the mission as required for the lunar landing at fra mauro theore the first order of business was to re establish the free return trajectory with a 307 second burn of the dps the descent engine was used again two hours after  the closest approach to the moon pc+2 burn to speed the return to earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the indian ocean to the pacific ocean a more aggressive burn could have been performed at pc+2 by first jettisoning the service module returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort name   missionopreport suppampnbspiii 20 sup but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used the 4 minute 24 second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed
considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew s and support personnel for the safe return the developing drama was shown on television  because electrical power was severely limited no more live tv broadcasts were made tv commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations low power levels made even voice communications difficult
the lunar module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half not three people for four days oxygen was the least critical consumable because the lm carried enough to repressurize the lm after each surface  unlike the  csm which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct the lm was powered by  so electrical power and water used for equipment cooling as well as drinking were critical consumables to keep the lm life support and communication systems operational until re entry the lm was powered down to the lowest levels possible in particular the lms  was used for most of the coast back to earth instead of the primary guidance system as it used less power and water name   missionopreport supppampnbspiii‑173340 sup
availability of  lioh for  presented a serious problem the lms internal stock of lioh canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return and the remainder was stored in the descent stage out of reach the cm had an adequate supply of canisters but these were incompatible with the lm engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube shaped cm canisters to the lms cylindrical canister sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose the astronauts called the jury rigged device the mailbox 
another problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power up from scratch of the completely shut down command module something never intended to be done in flight flight controller  with the support of grounded astronaut mattingly and many engineers and designers had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ships limited power supply and time factor  this was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the lm caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as  the unpowered cm got so cold that water began to  on solid surfaces causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated this turned out not to be a problem partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the  fire 
the last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before re entry the normal procedure was to use the service modules  rcs to pull the csm away after releasing the lm along with the command modules docking ring but this rcs was inoperative because of the power failure and the useless sm would be released before the lm to solve the problem grumman called on the engineering expertise of the university of toronto a team of six ut engineers was formed led by senior scientist  to solve the problem in one day the team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the lunar module to the command module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re entry the team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required using s they needed an accurate calculation as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal causing the astronauts to burn up too low a pressure would fail to provide sufficient separation of the lm grumman relayed their calculation to nasa and from there in turn to the astronauts who used it successfully name gampm 
as apollo 13 neared earth the crew first jettisoned the service module using the lms  to pull themselves a safe distance from it instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the sms rcs they photographed it for later analysis of the accidents cause it was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the entire sector 4 panel had been blown off according to the analysts these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment
finally the crew jettisoned the lunar module aquarius using the above procedure worked out at the university of toronto leaving the command module odyssey to begin its lone re entry through the atmosphere the re entry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the command module the blackout in apollo 13s reentry lasted six minutes which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected  the possibility of heat shield damage from the  tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period
odyssey regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the south pacific ocean  southwest of  and  from the recovery ship 
the crew was in good condition except for haise who was suffering from a serious  because of insufficient water intake to avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft the crew had been instructed to temporarily stop urine dumps a misunderstanding prompted the crew to store all urine for the rest of the flight 
nasa administrator  and deputy administrator  sent a memorandum to nasa  director  on april 17 1970 date of spacecraft splashdown advising him of his appointment as chairman of an apollo 13 review board to investigate the cause of the accident

the board exhaustively investigated and analyzed the history of the manufacture and testing of the oxygen tank and its installation and testing in the spacecraft up to the apollo 13 launch as documented in detailed records and logs they visited and consulted with engineers at the contractors sites and the kennedy space center once a theory of the cause was developed elements of it were tested including on a test rig simulation in a vacuum chamber with a damaged tank installed in the fuel cell bay this test confirmed the theory when a similar explosion was created which blew off the outer panel exactly as happened in the flight

the resulting pressure inside the compartment popped the bolts attaching the  sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel which as it blew off probably caused minor damage to the nearby s band antenna name auto 
 forced the oxygen valves closed on the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells leaving them operating for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines the shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank or caused its check or relief valve to leak causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes entirely depleting the sms oxygen supply name report  
the board determined the oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events tanks storing s such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen require either venting extremely good insulation or both in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks contents the service module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain  hydrogen and oxygen for years each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water the construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible
the tank contained several components relevant to the accident
 a quantity sensor
 a fan to stir the tank contents for more accurate quantity measurements
 a  to vaporize liquid oxygen as needed
 a  to protect the heater
 a 
 fill and drain valves and piping
the heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the command modules 28 volt dc bus the specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65 volt ground supply in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly  the tank subcontractor did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage
the oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the apollo 10 service module but was removed to fix a potential  problem during removal the shelf was accidentally dropped about  because a retaining bolt had not been removed the tank appeared to be undamaged but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged and photographs suggested that the close out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf the report of the apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be rather low name report  
after the tank was filled for ground testing it could not be emptied through the normal drain line to avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank the heater was connected to 65 volt ground power to boil off the oxygen lovell signed off on this procedure it should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of  when the thermostat opened the 65 volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered the board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage
this raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated  a  on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly but no one noticed it at the time because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the  thermostat opening temperature the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank  name lostmoon  the gas evaporated in hours rather than days
the sustained high temperatures melted the  insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed when the tank was illed with oxygen it became a bomb waiting to go off during the cryo stir procedure fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted producing sparks and igniting the teflon this in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it
in june 1970 the cortright report name report   provided an in depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five chapter report with eight appendices it included a copy of established nasa procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank to include
turning the four tank heaters and fans off
pulling the two heater circuit breakers to open to remove the energy source
performing a 2 minute purge or directly opening the osub2 sub valve
this procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued the mission operations report apollo 13 recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low pressure reading on hydrogen tank 2 and so it did not trigger to call attention to the high oxygen pressure reading 
oxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission prior to the accident the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the lunar module forward by three hours this was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium she tank in the lm descent stage which had been suspect since before launch after the abort decision the helium pressure continued to rise and mission control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture the helium tank  ruptured at 10854 after the lunar flyby the expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control ptc roll nicknamed the barbecue roll 
while the investigation board did recreate the oxygen tank failure it did not report on any experiments that would show how effective the cryogenic malfunctions procedures were to prevent the system failure by de energizing the electrical heater and fan circuits
the oxygen tank was redesigned with the thermostats upgraded to handle the proper voltage the heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure the stirring fans with their unsealed motors were removed which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate this required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full name gatland2 
all electrical wiring in the power system bay was sheathed in stainless steel and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel the fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the teflon coated wiring from the oxygen the spacecraft and mission control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies name gatland2 
because apollo 13 followed the  its altitude over the  was approximately  greater than the orbital altitude on the remaining apollo lunar missions due to this fact apollo 13 holds the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft reaching a distance of  from earth on 721ampnbsppm est april 14 1970 
the  spacesuit intended to be worn on the lunar surface by lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms legs lunar eva helmet assembly and the life support backpack this came about because mission control personnel watching the video feeds of apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down the red bands were used for the remaining apollo flights the  and in the 
the apollo 13 mission was called a successful failure by lovell
  because of the successful safe return of the astronauts but the failed lunar landing lead   and
  the first one to see the telemetry of the initial oxygen tank failure both describe it decades later as nasas finest hour  
president nixon awarded the  to the crew and the  for their actions during the mission
the cold cathode gauge experiment ccge which was part of the  on apollo 13 was never flown again it was a version of the cold cathode ion gauge ccig which featured on apollo 12 apollo 14 and  the ccge was designed as a standalone version of the ccig on other missions the ccig was connected as part of the suprathermal ion detector side because of the aborted landing this experiment was never deployed other experiments included on apollo 13s alsep included the heat flow experiment hfe the passive seismic experiment pse and the charged particle lunar environment experiment cplee 
the original  affixed to the front landing leg of aquarius bore mattingly’s name so a replacement plaque with swigert’s name was carried in the cabin for lovell to place over the other after he descended the ladder he kept the plaque as a souvenir in his book  later renamed apollo 13 lovell stated that apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces the only other memento he possesses is a letter from 
the apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as apollos chariot across space given lovells navy background the logo also included the mottoes ex luna scientia from the moon knowledge borrowed from the s motto ex scientia tridens from knowledge sea power the mission number appeared in  as apollo xiii the patch did not have to be modified after mattinglys replacement since it is one of only two apollo mission insignia—the other being apollo 11—not to include the names of the crew it was designed by artist  who based it on a mural he had done for  in new york city   the mural was later purchased by actor  who portrayed lovell in the movie  and now is on the wall of a restaurant near chicago owned by lovells son 
despite apollo 13s failure to land on the moon several experiments were conducted successfully because they were initiated before or conducted independently of the oxygen tank explosion 
several experiments to study electrical phenomena were conducted prior to and during the launch of apollo 13 this information was used to better understand hazards of launching in less than ideal weather conditions
 eleven photographs of earth were taken at precisely recorded times to study the feasibility of using geosynchronous satellites to study cloud height
 apollo 13s  third stage was the first to be purposely crashed into the lunar surface as an active seismic experiment which measured its impact with a seismometer left on the lunar surface by the crew of apollo 12 the s ivbs from the previous four lunar missions were sent into solar orbit by ground control after use
as a joke following apollo 13s successful splashdown  pilot sam greenberg who had helped with the strategy for re routing power from the lm to the crippled cm issued a tongue in cheek invoice for 40054005 to   and    prime and subcontractors for the csm for towing the crippled ship most of the way to the moon and back the figure was based on an estimated  at 100 per mile plus 400 for the first mile an extra 53605 was included for battery charging oxygen and an additional guest in room swigert a 20% commercial discount as well as a further 2% discount if north american were to pay in cash reduced the total to 31242124 one version of the invoice includes an extra 100000 charge for keeping this invoice confidential  north american declined payment noting that it had ferried three previous grumman lms to the moon apollo 10 apollo 11 and apollo 12 with no such reciprocal charges

the 1974 movie  while set around the apollo 13 incident is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives only a couple of news clips and a narrators solemn voice deal with the actual problems houston weve got a problem was also the title of an episode of the  documentary series a life at stake broadcast in march 1978 this was an accurate if simplified reconstruction of the events 
lovell was approached in 1991 by journalist  about collaborating on a non fiction account of the mission the resultant book  was published in 1994 the next year a film adaptation of the book  was released directed by  and starring  as lovell  as haise  as swigert  as mattingly  as   and  as marilyn lovell james lovell kranz and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy given that some  was taken for example the film changes the tense of lovells famous statement houston weve had a problem to houston we have a problem name air2ground   the film was nominated for several academy awards including best picture best supporting actor harris and best supporting actress quinlan
in the 1998 miniseries  co produced by hanks and howard the mission is dramatized in the episode we interrupt this program rather than showing the incident from the crews perspective as in the apollo 13 feature film it is instead presented from an earth bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event
in 2008 an interactive theatrical show titled   premiered at  in wellington new zealand theatreview media release and subsequent reviews of the  production of apollo 13 mission control  the production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline the show also featured a guest astronaut each night a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line houston weve had a problem this replacement astronaut was a nod to jack swigert who replaced ken mattingly shortly before the launch in 1970 the production toured to other cities extensively in new zealand and australia in 2010–2011 the production was scheduled to travel to the usa in 2012
in november 2011 a notebook containing a checklist lovell used to calculate a trajectory to get the damaged spacecraft apollo 13 back to earth and handwritten calculations by lovell was auctioned off by  for 388375 nasa made an email inquiry asking heritage if lovell had clear title to the notebook stating that nasa had nothing to indicate the agency had ever transferred ownership of the checklist to lovell in january 2012 heritage stated that the sale had been placed on hold after nasa launched an investigation into whether it was the astronaut’s property to sell

apollo 7 was a 1968  mission carried out by the  it was the first mission in the united states  to carry a crew into space it was also the first us spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of  in november 1966 the  also known as apollo 1 was intended to be the first manned flight of the apollo program scheduled to launch in february 1967 however a fire in the cabin during a january 1967 test killed the crew manned flights were then suspended for 21 months while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements were made to the spacecraft and safety procedures apollo 7 essentially fulfilled apollo 1s mission 
the apollo 7 crew was commanded by  with command module pilot  and lunar module pilot  their mission was  an 11 day earth orbital test flight to check out the redesigned block ii  csm with a crew on board it was the first launch of a  vehicle to put a crew into space the first three person american space mission and the first live tv broadcast from an american spacecraft it was successfully launched on october 11 1968 from what was then known as  florida despite tension between the crew and ground controllers the mission was a complete technical success giving  the confidence to launch  around the  two months later however the flight would prove to be the final space flight for all of its three crew members when it splashed down in the atlantic ocean on october 22 1968 it was also the final  launch from 
schirra eisele and cunningham were first named as an apollo crew on september 29 1966 they were to fly a second earth orbital test of the original block i command service module not designed to dock with the  for lunar flight after  the first manned flight to be made by   and  in december 1966 the second mission was deemed redundant and canceled and schirras crew were reassigned as grissoms backup
plans for the first manned apollo flights were completely disrupted by the january 27 1967 cabin fire which killed grissom white and chaffee schirra eisele and cunningham were later named as prime crew for the first manned flight which would now use the block ii spacecraft designed for the lunar missions the  cm and astronauts spacesuits had been extensively redesigned to reduce and eliminate the chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew schirra thus became the only astronaut to fly   and apollo missions name schirras obituary  his crew would test the life support propulsion guidance and control systems during this open ended mission meaning it would be extended as it passed each test the duration was limited to 11 days reduced from the original 14 day limit for apollo 1  since it flew in  and did not include the  lm apollo 7 was launched with the saturn ib booster rather than the much larger and more powerful  name saturn ib history 
throughout the mercury and gemini programs  engineer  had been leader of the spacecraft launch pad teams with ultimate responsibility for condition of the spacecraft at launch he earned the astronauts respect and admiration including schirras name guenter wendt obit  however the spacecraft contractor had changed from mcdonnell mercury amp gemini to  apollo so wendt was not the pad leader for apollo 1 name firstonthemoon pp 51–54 
so adamant was schirra in his desire to have wendt back as pad leader for his apollo flight that he got his boss  to persuade north american management to hire wendt away from mcdonnell and schirra personally lobbied north americans launch operations manager to change wendts shift from midnight to day so he could be pad leader for apollo 7 wendt remained as pad leader for the entire apollo program name firstonthemoon  
wendts face was the last they saw before the hatch was sealed and immediately after liftoff eisele said with a mock german accent into his radio i vonder vere guenter vendt name firstonthemoon  
the first manned american space flight in 22 months lifted from lc 34 at 1005 am local time on friday october 22 1968 liftoff proceeded flawlessly the saturn ib performed well on its first manned launch and there were no significant anomalies during the boost phase the astronauts described it as very smooth riding compared to the rough bumpy titan ii used to launch the  spacecraft
following orbital injection and separation from the  the crew turned the csm around using its  thrusters and eisele practiced a simulated lunar module rendezvous and docking using a visual erence target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the lm one of the adapter panels on the s ivb failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position reminding   of his angry alligator experience on  when docking was prevented by mis deployed adapter panels had this been an actual lunar mission the astronauts might have found the process of lm extraction from the adapter more difficult risking possible damage this reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent apollo saturn v flights name astronautixcom 
the apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems and the  sps the all important engine that would place apollo into and out of lunar orbit made eight firings performing within 1% of the engine acceptance test thrust and  values as the saturn ib itself had performed very smoothly during launch the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the sps leading to schirra yelling yabbadabbadoo in erence to  cartoon don eisele called it a real boot in the rear 
an assortment of minor hardware problems occurred over the flight these included the drinking water hose trigger sticking during the final two days a momentary undervolt of the main ac buses caused by the automatic cryo fan switch in the service module lox and lh2 tanks and a loss of telemetry due to a malfunctioning electrical commutator following sm jettison at the end of the mission meaning that the final 15 minutes of data transmission were lost aside from the last event which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator all of the problems on apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions
apollo promised the best food preparation yet seen on a manned spacecraft for the first time astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with the food came in freeze dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water and wally schirra who had  had only toothpaste like tubes for food on his  described the food as still does not match home cooking but it comes a lot closer than space food used to thirty three meals were provided for the three crewmen allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space even so the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet although the menus had been prepared based on their personal perences apollo 7 was also the only time so called astronaut ice cream which went on to become a staple of hobby shops was carried on an actual flight
early fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the cm would make it hard for the spacecrafts attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded and they reported that motion was incredibly easy with no gravity to work against as sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful an exercise device called the exer genie was provided name astronautixcom  
another mission goal was the first   from an american spacecraft  had transmitted  pictures from  in 1963 which were never broadcast name apollo video camera pp 55–58  it was initially scheduled for midday on day two but schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the  test name schirra cancels tv 
even though apollos larger cabin was more comfortable than geminis 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts tension with schirra began with the launch decision when flight managers decided to launch with a less than ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent once in orbit the spacious cabin may have induced some crew  which had not been an issue in the earlier smaller spacecraft the crew were unhappy with their food selections especially the high energy sweets they also found the waste collection system cumbersome requiring 30 minutes to use and smelly but the worst problem occurred when schirra developed a severe  as a result he became irritable with requests from  and all three astronauts began talking back to the capcom an early example was this exchange after mission control requested that a tv camera be turned on in the spacecraft

schirra we do not have the equipment out we have not had an opportunity to follow setting we have not eaten at this point at this point i have a cold i use to foul up our time lines this way 
 blockquote
a further source of tension between mission control and the crew was that schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off contrary to previous project mercury and gemini experience they perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds and they wanted to be able to pinch their noses and blow to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry this would have been impossible wearing the helmets as the new apollo helmets were a continuous fishbowl type without a moveable visor unlike previous helmets however on repeated occasions over the course of the mission schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons in the final exchange on the subject mission control made it clear to schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions

in april 1966 mcdivitt scott and schweickart were selected by deke slayton as the second apollo crew as backup to   and  for the first manned earth orbital test flight of the   designated  expected to fly in late 1966 this was to be followed by a second block i flight as 205 to be crewed by   and
 the third manned mission designated as 207 208 was planned to fly the block ii command module and the  in earth orbit launched on separate s with a crew to be named
however delays in the block i csm development pushed as 204 into 1967 by december 1966 the original as 205 mission was cancelled schirras crew was named as grissoms backup and mcdivitts crew was promoted to prime crew for the lm test mission  re designated as 205 208 on january 26 1967 they were training for this flight expected to occur in late 1967 in the first block ii command module 101 at the  plant in 
 
the next day grissoms crew were conducting a launch pad test for their planned february 21 mission which they named  when a fire broke out in the cabin killing all three men and putting an 18 month hold on the manned program while the block ii  cm and  were redesigned for safety
as it turned out a 1967 launch of as 205 208 would have been impossible even absent the apollo 1 accident as problems with the lm delayed its first unmanned test flight until january 1968 nasa was able to use the 18 month hiatus to catch up with development and unmanned testing of the lm and the saturn v launch vehicle 
by october 1967 planning for manned flights resumed with  being the first earth orbit csm flight now known as the c mission in october 1968 given to schirras crew and mcdivitts mission now known as the d mission following as apollo 8 in december 1968 using a single saturn v instead of the two saturn ibs this would be followed by a higher earth orbit flight e mission to be crewed by   and  in early 1969
however lm problems again prevented it from being ready for the d mission by december so nasa officials created another mission for  using the saturn v to launch only the csm on the first manned flight to orbit the moon and the e mission was cancelled as unnecessary slayton asked mcdivitt and borman which mission they perred to fly mcdivitt wanted to fly the lm while borman volunteered for the pioneering lunar flight theore slayton swapped the crews and mcdivitts crew flew apollo 9
the crew swap also affected who would be the first crew to land on the moon when the crews for apollo 8 and 9 were swapped their backup crews were also swapped since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later this put s crew bormans backup in position for the first landing mission  instead of s crew who made the second landing on 
apollo 9 was the first space test of the complete apollo spacecraft including the third critical piece of apollo hardware besides the command service module and the saturn v launch vehicle—the lunar module it was also the first  of two vehicles with an internal crew transfer between them for ten days the astronauts put both apollo spacecraft through their paces in earth orbit including an undocking and redocking of the lunar lander with the command vehicle just as the landing mission crew would perform in lunar orbit apollo 9 gave proof that the apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend
for this and all subsequent apollo flights the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft the last spacecraft to have been named was  the gangly lm was named spider and the csm was labeled gumdrop because of the command modules shape and also the blue wrapping in which the craft arrived at  these names were required as radio call signs when the vehicles flew independently
schweickart and scott performed an eva—schweickart checked out the new  the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft while scott filmed him from the command module hatch schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activities to test the suit and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an eva from the lunar module to the command module in an emergency but as he had been suffering from  the extra tests were scratched
mcdivitt and schweickart later test flew the lm and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in earth orbit they flew the lm up to  from gumdrop using the engine on the descent stage to propel them originally before jettisoning it and using the ascent stage to return this test flight represented the first flight of a manned spacecraft that was not equipped to reenter the earths atmosphere
the splashdown point was 23 deg 15 min n 67 deg 56 min w 180ampnbspmiles 290ampnbspkm east of  and within sight of the recovery ship  apollo 9 was the last spacecraft to splash down in the atlantic ocean
the command module was displayed at the michigan space and science center  until april 2004 when the center closed in may 2004 it was moved to the  now named the san diego air amp space museum the lm ascent stage orbit decayed on october 23 1981 the lm descent stage 1969 018d orbit decayed march 22 1969 the  stage  engine was restarted after lunar module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion

the circular patch shows a drawing of a saturn v rocket with the letters usa on it to its right an apollo csm is shown next to an lm with the csms nose pointed at the front door of the lm rather than at its top docking port the csm is trailing rocket fire in a circle the crews names are along the top edge of the circle with apollo  at the bottom the d in mcdivitts name is filled with red to mark that this was the d mission in the alphabetic sequence of apollo missions the patch was designed by allen stevens of  a version of this article was published concurrently in the s  magazine

 stiffness which may be worse in the morning or after use
  and fatigue

it is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to 100 billion of which almost 50% is from lost earnings each year arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to  centers 
decreased mobility in combination with the above symptoms can make it difficult for an individual to remain physically active contributing to an increased risk of obesity high  or vulnerability to   people with arthritis are also at increased risk of  which may be a response to numerous factors including fear of worsening symptoms 
diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests depending on the type of suspected arthritis  all arthritides potentially feature  pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location  is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness in the early stages patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower  on the other hand tends to be worse after exercise in the aged and children pain might not be the main presenting feature the aged patient simply moves less the infantile patient uses to use the affected limb
elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis important features are speed and time of onset pattern of joint involvement symmetry of symptoms early morning stiffness tenderness gelling or locking with inactivity aggravating and relieving factors and other systemic symptoms physical examination may confirm the diagnosis or may indicate systemic disease radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity
s and s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected these might include   anf  and specific antibodies
 is the most common form of arthritis name van2010  it can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body including the hands  feet back hip and knee the disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint however osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury in recent years some joint or limb deformities such as knock knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia have also been considered as a predisposing factor for knee or hip osteoarthritis osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other the condition starts with minor pain during physical activity but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest the pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities osteoarthritis typically affects the weight bearing joints such as the back spine and pelvis unlike rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly more than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65 risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma obesity and a sedentary lifestyle
rheumatoid arthritis ra is a disorder in which the bodys own immune system starts to attack body  the attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body in rheumatoid arthritis most damage occurs to the joint lining and  which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones ra often affects joints in the fingers wrists knees and elbows is symmetrical appears on both sides of the body and can lead to severe  in a few years if not treated ra occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above in children the disorder can present with a skin    disability and limitations in daily activities with earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment many individuals can lead a better quality of life than if going undiagnosed for long after ras onset the drugs to treat ra range from s to  given  treatments also include analgesics such as s and s dmards while in rare cases surgery may be required to replace joints but there is no cure for the diseasehttp  wwwaihwgovau rheumatoid arthritis management  medications used to manage rheumatoid arthritis australian institute of health and welfare retrieved 2015 11 14

bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing s and bone forming s one of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the  caused in part by the production of pro inflammatory  and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand rankl a cell surface protein present in th17 cells and osteoblasts name chabaud_2000  osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the rank rankl mechanism name pmid21464945 
 is a common   disorder that can be present with severe arthritis other features of lupus include a skin rash extreme    problems lung fibrosis and constant joint pain 
 is caused by deposition of  crystals in the joint causing inflammation there is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as  in the early stages the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint but with time it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling the joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout cannot successfully be treated name becker  when uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid eg allopurinol febuxostat or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys eg probenecid this can be erred to as ractory chronic gout or rcg name ali

acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe often associated with the atmospheres of s  one curious discovery of acetylene is on  a moon of  natural acetylene is believed to form from  decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of 1770ampnbspk and above since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry  
acetylene is not especially toxic but when generated from  it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of  and  which give it a distinct garlic like smell it is also highly flammable as most light hydrocarbons hence its use in welding its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability especially when it is pressurized under certain conditions acetylene can react in an  addition type reaction to form a number of products typically  and or  possibly in addition to  and  consequently acetylene if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about 200ampnbspkpa 29ampnbsppsi most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report  and the safe limit for acetylene theore is 101 kpasubgage sub or 15 psig   it is theore supplied and stored dissolved in  or  dmf name industrial gases  contained in a  with a porous filling  which renders it safe to transport and use given proper handling

athenian democracy developed around the fifth century bc in the greek  known as a  of  comprising the city of athens and the surrounding territory of  and is the first known  in the world other greek cities set up democracies most following the athenian model but none are as well documented as athens
it was a system of  in which participating citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills participation was not open to all residents to vote one had to be an adult male citizen who owned land and wasnt a slave and the number of these varied between 30000 and 50000 out of a total population of around 250000 to 300000thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005 https  booksgooglecom booksid iu6eagaaqbajamppg pa74 p 74 
the longest lasting democratic leader was  after his death athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by  revolutions towards the end of the  it was modified somewhat after it was restored under  and the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth century modification rather than the periclean system democracy was suppressed by the  in 322 bc the athenian institutions were later revived but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable  594 bc  508 7 bc an aristocrat and  462 bc contributed to the development of athenian democracy
the word democracy greek δημοκρατία combines the elements dêmos δῆμος which means people and krátos κράτος which means force or power in the words monarchy and oligarchy the second element arche ἀρχή means rule leading or being first it is unlikely that the term democracy was coined by its detractors who rejected the possibility of a valid demarchy as the word demarchy already existed and had the meaning of  or  one could assume the new term was coined and adopted by athenian democrats
the word is attested in  who wrote some of the first surviving greek prose but this might not have been before 440 or 430 bc we are not certain that the word democracy was extant when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted but around 460 bcraaflaub kurt a 2007 the breakthrough of demokratia in mid fifth century athens p 112 in   an individual is known with the name of democrates a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty the name can also be found in   anabasis 4415

part of the ethos of democracy however was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement in the 5th century version of the democracy the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent but for those who had power it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly rather than their vested powers
while citizens voting in the assembly were the people and so were free of review or punishment those same citizens when holding an office served the people and could be punished very severely all of them were subject to a review beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination after stepping down officeholders were the agents of the people not their representatives citizens active as office holders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors
the assembly and the courts were regarded as the instantiation of the people of athens they were the people no power was above them and they could not be reviewed impeached or punished however when an athenian took up an office he was regarded as serving the people as such he could be regarded as failing in his duty and be punished for it
there were in fact some limitations on who could hold office age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time an unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement  excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily depending on the type furthermore all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office dokimasia at which they might be disqualified
competence does not seem to have been the main issue but rather at least in the 4th century bc whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies however magistrates after leaving office were subject to a scrutiny euthunai literally straightenings or submission of accounts to review their performance both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic but they opened up in the possibility if some citizen wanted to take some matter up of a contest before a jury courthttps  booksgooglecom booksid iu6eagaaqbajampdq athenian+democracy+thorleyampsource gbs_navlinks_s thorley j athenian democracy routledge 2005  ppampnbsp42–43

by and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited the powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited they administered rather than governed when it came to penal sanctions no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas anything higher had to go before a court
 
the use of a lottery to select officeholders was regarded as the most democratic means elections would favour those who were rich noble eloquent and well known while  spread the work of administration throughout the whole citizen body engaging them in the crucial democratic experience of to use aristotles words ruling and being ruled in turn politics 1317b28–30 the allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought allotment theore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens a unique form of political equality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office samons writes that the system of selection by lottery for members of the council of 500 and other officials like the treasurers of the sacred funds provided a potentially significant check on the dangers of  however this may not have been completely successful as some increasingly pandered to the electorate andampnbsp often told the

the random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks but the system included features meant to obviate possible problems athenians selected for office served as teams boards panels in a group someone will know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do during the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else there were however officials such as the nine archons who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other
no office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual the only exception was the boule or council of 500 in this case simply by demographic necessity an individual could serve twice in a lifetime this principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons to the athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing powerraaflaub kurt a ober josiah and wallace

during an athenian election approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot there were two main categories in this group those required to handle large sums of money and the 10 generals the  one reason that financial officials were elected was that any money  could be recovered from their estates election in general strongly favoured the rich but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite
generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider greek world where wars were fought in the 5th century bc principally as seen through the figure of  the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis yet in the case of pericles it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships each year along with nine others his office holding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded that influence was based on his relation with the assembly a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons in part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialised forms of warfare practiced in the later period
elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office and they too could be removed from office at any time that the assembly met there was also a death penalty for inadequate performance while in office name historyandpolicy 
a good example of the contempt the first democrats felt for those who did not participate in politics can be found in the modern word idiot which finds its origins in the ancient greek word  idiōtēs meaning a private person a person who is not actively interested in politicsgoldhill s 2004 the good citizen in love sex amp tragedy why classics matters john murray london 179 94  such characters were talked about with contempt and the word eventually acquired its modern meaning according to thucydides pericles may have declared in a funeral oration

athenian democracy has had many critics both ancient and modern ancient greek critics of the democracy include  the general and historian  the playwright  the pupil of socrates  the pupil of plato and a writer known as the  modern critics are more likely to find fault with the narrow definition of the citizen body but in the ancient world the complaint if anything went in the opposite direction for them the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and had made huge mistakes according to samonsblockquotethe modern desire to look to athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought government or society must confront this strange paradox the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime on a philosophical or theoretical level and what is more the actual history of athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures mistakes and misdeeds—most infamously the execution of socrates—that would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good governmenthttps  booksgooglecom booksid hhofuylklaacampdq athens+execute+generalsampq %22modern+desire+to+look+to+athens%22#v snippetampq %22modern%20desire%20to%20look%20to%20athens%22ampf false samons l whats wrong with democracy from athenian practice to american worship university of california press 2004 p 6  blockquote
thucydides from his aristocratic and historical viewpoint reasoned that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly  notes that thucydides cites examples of two errors regarding  the beliefs that the two spartan kings each had two votes in council and that there was a spartan battalion called the pitanate lochos thucydides sums up such is the degree of carelessness among the many  in the search for truth  and their perence for ready made accounts he contrasted his own critical historical approach to history with the way the demos decided upon the truth so thucydides has established for his reader the existence of a potentially fatal structural flaw in the edifice of democratic ways of knowing and doing the identification of this flaw is a key to his criticism of athenian popular rulehttps  booksgooglecom booksid ikxxc7afuakcampdq athenian+democracy+thucydides+criticampq %27pitanate+lochos#v snippetampq pitanate%20lochosampf false ober j political dissent in democratic athens intellectual critics of popular rule princeton university press 2001 pp 54 amp 78–79

whether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic or as a product of the extreme conditions of the peloponnesian war there does seem to have been a move toward correction a new version of democracy was established from 403 bc but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent orms  416 bc end of assembly trials 355 bc for instance the system of nomothesia was introduced in thisblockquote
a new law might be proposed by any citizen any proposal to modify an existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law the citizen making the proposal had to publish it in advance publication consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the statues of the eponymous heroes in the agora the proposal would be considered by the council and would be placed on the agenda of the assembly in the form of a motion if the assembly voted in favor of the proposed change the proposal would be erred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai literally establishers of the law name homepagesgacedu   blockquote
increasingly responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts that is to say the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath and with more time to focus on just one matter though never more than a day one downside was that the new democracy was less capable of rapid response
another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of athenian life although democracy predated athenian imperialism by over thirty years they are sometimes associated with each other for much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states  the son of milesias not the historian an aristocrat stood in opposition to these policies for which he was ostracised in 443 bc
at times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality as in the decision to execute the entire male population of  and sell off its women and children simply for using to become subjects of athens the common people were numerically dominant in the navy which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions further they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding this is the position set out by the anti democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the  this writer also called  produced several comments critical of democracy such as

2 the collectivization of political responsibility for decisions and agreements in a democracy leads to dishonesty and the tendency to scapegoat individual speakers or magistrates
3 because it is an integrated system democracy seems incapable of internal amelioration yet because of its inclusivist tendencies especially in regard to citizenship it coopts its natural enemies and so generates few active opponents
4 there is a strong relationship between a democracys domestic and foreign policies a rational imperial democracy will be likely to foment democracy among its subjects
5 democracy depends on naval power naval power in turn depends on the control of capital resources ergo a democracy will tend to be aggressively acquisitive

aristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of government than democracy rather than any citizen partaking with equal share in the rule he thought that virtue understood as embracing courage and temperance and prudence as well as justice turns out to be the chief determinant for shares in rule those who are superior in virtue should receive greater shares in rulehttps  booksgooglecom booksid zqffujbiwvscampdq athens+hansenampq %22the+chief+determinant+%22#v snippetampq %22the%20chief%20determinant%20%22ampf false beck h companion to ancient greek government john wiley amp sons 2013 p107 
a case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under athenian democracy than before or elsewhere in particular in relation to women and slaves as well as in the line between citizens and non citizens by so strongly validating one role that of the male citizen it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it
originally a male would be a citizen if his father was a citizen under  in 450 bc restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born to an athenian father and an athenian mother so metroxenoi those with foreign mothers were now to be excluded also at least by demosthenes time mixed marriages were actually heavily penalized many athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship had this law applied to them  the founder of democracy had a non athenian mother and the mothers of  and  were not greek at all but  name hansen 1991 53https  booksgooglecom booksid o2mgjqbfgp4campdq athens+democracy+++++hansen+slave+womenampq offspring+from+slave+women#v snippetampq offspring%20from%20slave%20womenampf false hansen mh the athenian democracy in the age of demosthenes structure principles and ideology university of oklahoma press 1991 p53

when my father who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at  acting for the n merchants going there was in charge he summoned me to him while i was still a child and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting there when i had been introduced to the art of the indians nine symbols through remarkable teaching knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and i came to understand it
the numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right with higher value positions added to the left this arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in europe languages written in the latin alphabet run from left to right unlike languages written in the arabic alphabet hence from the point of view of the reader numerals in western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first
the reason the digits are more commonly known as arabic numerals in europe and the americas is that they were introduced to europe in the 10th century by arabic speakers of north africa who were then using the digits from libya to morocco arabs on the other hand call the system  numerals name uniofnthc1  name twptakeano  erring to their origin in india this is not to be confused with what the arabs call the hindi numerals namely the                             used in the middle east or any of the  in  eg   name ifrah

alexander selkirk 167613 december 1721 also known as alexander selcraig was a scottish sailor who spent more than four years as a  after being  on an uninhabited island in the  also known as the south sea
selkirk was an unruly youth and joined ing expeditions to the  one such expedition was aboard the  commanded by  the ship called in for provisions at the  off chile and selkirk judged correctly that his craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there
by the time that he was rescued he had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island his story of survival was widely publicised when he returned home and became a likely source of inspiration for writer s fictional character  
alexander selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in   scotland born in 1676 in his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition he was summoned before the  in august 1693 for his indecent conduct in church but he did not appear being gone to sea he was back at largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for beating up his brothers
early on he was engaged in buccaneering in 1703 he joined an expedition of english  and explorer  to the  setting sail from  in ireland on 11 september they carried  from the  authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the  was then going on between england and france  dampier was  of the st george and selkirk served on the  st georges companion ship as  under captain  by this time selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea
in february 1704 following a stormy passage round  the privateers fought a long battle with a well armed french vessel the st joseph only to have it escape to warn the spanish of the buccaneers arrival in the pacific a raid failed on the panamanian gold mining town of santa maría when their landing party was ed the easy capture of the asunción a heavily laden merchantman revived the mens hopes of plunder and selkirk was put in charge of the   dampier took off some much needed provisions of wine brandy sugar and flour then abruptly set the ship free believing that the gain was not worth the effort in may 1704 stradling decided to abandon dampier and strike out on his own
in september 1704 after parting ways with dampier captain stradling brought the cinque ports to an island known to the spanish as  located in the uninhabited   off the coast of chile for a mid expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies
selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel and probably wanted to make the needed repairs before going any farther  he declared that he would rather be left on juan fernández than continue in a dangerously leaky ship  stradling granted his request and landed selkirk and his personal effects on the island  selkirk regretted his rashness but stradling used to let him back on board
cinque ports did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now   stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the spanish  the survivors were taken to  peru where they endured a harsh imprisonment
at first selkirk remained along the shoreline of juan fernández  during this time he ate  and scanned the ocean daily for rescue suffering all the while from loneliness misery and remorse  hordes of raucous  gathered on the beach for the mating season and they eventually drove him to the islands interior once inland his way of life took a turn for the better  more foods were available there s—introduced by earlier sailors—provided him with meat and milk while wild s  and dried  offered him variety and spice  s would attack him at night but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near s
selkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island he forged a new knife out of  hoops left on the beach he built two huts out of  trees one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses  as his gunpowder dwindled he had to chase prey on foot  during one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff lying helpless and unable to move for about a day  his prey had cushioned his fall likely sparing him a broken back
his childhood lessons now served him well which he had learned from his father a tanner  for example when his clothes wore out he made new ones from hair covered goatskins using a nail for sewing as his shoes became unusable he had no need to replace them since his toughened callused feet made protection unnecessary he sang  and read from the  finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his english
during his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor  unfortunately for selkirk both were spanish  as a scotsman and a privateer he risked a grim fate if captured and theore tried to hide himself  on one occasion he was spotted and chased by a group of sailors from one of the ships  his pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to discover him  frustrated his would be captors gave up and sailed away
selkirks long awaited deliverance came on 2 february 1709 by way of the duke a privateering ship  by  and its sailing companion the duchess  led the landing party that met selkirk after four years and four months without human company selkirk was almost incoherent with joy the duke captain and leader of the expedition was  who mischievously erred to him as the governor of the island  the agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of rogers men who were suffering from 
captain rogers was impressed by selkirks physical vigour and also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island observing one may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably as this man was he made selkirk the dukes  later giving him command of one of their prize ships the increase before it was ransomed by the spanish
selkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance  at  in present day ecuador he led a boat crew up the  where a number of wealthy spanish ladies had fled and relieved them of the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing his part in the hunt for treasure  along the coast of mexico resulted in the capture of the  renamed batchelor on which he served as sailing master under captain dover to the  selkirk completed the round the world voyage by the  as the sailing master of the duke arriving at  off the english coast on 1 october 1711 he had been away for eight years
selkirks experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in england rogers included an account of selkirks ordeal in a book chronicling their privateering expedition entitled a cruising voyage round the world 1712 the following year prominent essayist  wrote an article about him for the englishman newspaper  selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity claiming his share of the duke plundered wealth—about £800 equivalent to £ today however legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain
after a few months in  he began to seem more like his former self again in september 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in  and may have been kept in confinement for two years he returned to lower largo where he met sophia bruce a young dairymaid they eloped to london early in 1717 but apparently did not marry he was soon off to sea again having enlisted in the  while on a visit to  in 1720 he married a widowed innkeeper named frances candis he was serving as  on board  engaged in an anti  patrol off the west coast of africa when he died on 13 december 1721 succumbing to the  that plagued the voyage  he was buried at sea
when  published  1719 few readers could have missed the resemblance to selkirk  an illustration on the first page of the novel shows a rather melancholy looking man standing on the shore of an island gazing inland in the words of modern explorer  he is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins his feet and shins bare yet crusoes island is located not in the  of the south pacific but  away in the  where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the  heat  this incongruity supports the popular belief that selkirk was a model for the fictional character
 s the solitude of alexander selkirk is about selkirks feelings as the castaway lived all alone on the island  this poem gave rise to the common phrase monarch of all i survey via the verse
poemi am monarch of all i survey
my right there is none to dispute
from the centre all round to the sea

selkirk has been memorialised in his scottish birthplace  delivered a speech on 11 december 1885 after which his wife  unveiled a bronze statue and plaque in memory of selkirk outside a house on the site of his original home on the main street of lower largo fife scotland david gillies of cardy house lower largo a descendant of the selkirks donated the statue created by thomas stuart burnett

an  expedition to the juan fernández islands in february 2005 found part of a nautical instrument that could have belonged to selkirk it was a fragment of copper alloy identified as being from a pair of  dating from the early 18th or late 17th century selkirk is the only person known to have been on the island at that time who is likely to have had dividers and was even said by rogers to have had such instruments in his possession the artefact was discovered while excavating a site not far from selkirks lookout where the famous castaway is believed to have lived

the international symbol of the acre is ac the most commonly used acre today is the international acre in the united states both the international acre and the slightly different us survey acre are in use the most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land one international acre is defined as exactly ampnbspsquare metres
an acre was defined in the middle ages being the amount of land that could be ed in one day with a  of oxen
one acre equals 00015625ampnbspsquare miles 4840ampnbspsquare yards 43560 national institute of standards and technology http  tsnistgov weightsandmeasures publications upload h4402_appencpdf nd general tables of units of measurement  or about  see below while all modern variants of the acre contain 4840ampnbspsquare yards there are alternative definitions of a yard so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based originally an acre was understood as a  of land sized at forty  660ampnbspft or 1ampnbsp long and four perches 66ampnbspft wide name klein2012  this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day a  enclosing one acre is approximately 6957ampnbspyards or  on a side as a unit of measure an acre has no prescribed shape any area of 43560ampnbspsquare feet is an acre

both the international acre and the us survey acre contain  of a square mile or 4840ampnbspsquare yards but there are alternative definitions of a yard see  and  so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based the us survey acre is about  square metres its exact value ampnbspmsup2 sup is based on an inch defined by 1ampnbspmetre   3937ampnbspinches exactly as established by the  surveyors in the united states use both international and survey feet and consequently both varieties of acre january 1991 http  wwwngsnoaagov info policy st_planehtml policy of the national geodetic survey concerning units of measure for the state plane coordinate system of 1983 
since the difference between the us survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an a4 sheet of paper 0016ampnbspsquare metres 160 square centimetres or 248ampnbspsquare inches it is usually not important which one is being discussed areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectablehttp  wwwacsmnet _data global images pdf%20documents acsm 20110223altaacsmlandtitlesurveystandard2011pdf minimum standard detail requirements for alta acsm land title surveys federick md american congress on surveying and mapping 2011 the standard uses precision in a sense more typically used for accuracy the stated maximum allowable precision page 3 is 2ampnbspcm and 50 parts per million an instrument consistently measuring 2ampnbspcm short would measure the area of a one international acre square 63614907ampnbspm on a side as 40443ampnbspsquare metres 26ampnbspsquare metres less than the true value a far greater discrepancy than the difference between the international and survey acres

perhaps the easiest way for us residents to envisage an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88ampnbspyards by 55ampnbspyards  of 880ampnbspyards by  of 880ampnbspyards about  the size of a standard   to be more exact one acre is 9075 percent of a  long by  wide american football field without the s the full field including the end zones covers approximately 
for residents of other countries the acre might be envisaged as approximately 5668 percent of a  long by  wide 
it may also be remembered as 44000ampnbspsquare feet less 1%
the word acre is derived from   originally meaning open field  to west coast norwegian  and           and    in english it was historically spelled 
the acre was approximately the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one dayhttp  wwwoedcom viewdictionaryentry entry 1769 acre nsup2 sup oed online september 2011 oxford university press accessed november 15 2012  this explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one  and one  a long narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot since the plough does not have to be turned so often the word furlong itself derives from the fact that it is one  long
before the enactment of the  many countries in europe used their own official acres these were differently sized in different countries for instance the historical french acre was 4221ampnbspsquare metres whereas in  as many variants of acre existed as there were german states
statutory values for the acre were enacted in england and subsequently the united kingdom by acts of
 and
 – the british  of 1878 defined it as containing 4840ampnbspsquare yards
historically the size of farms and landed estates in the united kingdom was usually expressed in acres or acres s and  even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles for example a certain landowner might have been said to own 32000ampnbspacres of land not 50ampnbspsquare miles of land

adenosine triphosphate atp is a  used in  as a  often called the  unit of  of intracellular  
atp transports chemical energy within  for  it is one of the end products of   and  and used by s and  in many cellular processes including   and   one molecule of atp contains three  groups and it is produced by a wide variety of enzymes including  from  adp or  amp and various phosphate group donors   in  and  in  are three major mechanisms of atp biosynthesis
metabolic processes that use atp as an energy source convert it back into its  atp is theore continuously recycled in organisms the human body which on average contains only  of atp  turns over its own body weight equivalent in atp each day 
atp is used as a  in  pathways by s that  s and s it is also used by  which uses atp to produce the  molecule  the ratio between atp and amp is used as a way for a cell to sense how much energy is available and control the s that produce and consume atp  apart from its roles in signaling and energy metabolism atp is also incorporated into s by s in the process of  atp is the neurotransmitter believed to signal the sense of taste 
the structure of this molecule consists of a  base  attached by the 9 nitrogen atom to the 1 carbon atom of a  sugar  three phosphate groups are attached at the 5 carbon atom of the pentose sugar it is the addition and removal of these phosphate groups that inter convert atp  and amp when atp is used in dna synthesis the ribose sugar is first converted to  by 
atp was discovered in 1929 by karl lohmann  and independently by cyrus fiske and  of   but its correct structure was not determined until some years later it was proposed to be the intermediary molecule between energy yielding and energy requiring reactions in cells by  in 1941  it was first artificially synthesized by  in 1948 
atp consists of ampnbsp— composed of an  ring and a  sugarampnbsp— and three  groups triphosphate the phosphoryl groups starting with the group closest to the ribose are erred to as the alpha α beta β and gamma γ phosphates consequently it is closely related to the adenosine nucleotide a  of  atp is highly soluble in water and is quite stable in solutions between phampnbsp68 and 74 but is rapidly  at extreme ph consequently atp is best stored as an anhydrous salt 
atp is an unstable molecule in  water in which it  to  and phosphate this is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in atp is less than the strength of the s hydration bonds between its products adp + phosphate and water thus if atp and adp are in  in water almost all of the atp will eventually be converted to adp a system that is far from equilibrium contains  and is capable of doing  living cells maintain the ratio of atp to adp at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium with atp concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of adp this displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of atp in the cell releases a large amount of free energy name nicholls 
two  bonds those that connect adjacent phosphates in an atp molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule name stryer p376  in the context of biochemical reactions these anhydride bonds are frequently—and sometimes controversially—erred to as  despite the fact it takes energy to break bonds  energy stored in atp may be released upon  of the anhydride bonds name stryer p376  the primary phosphate group on the atp molecule that is hydrolyzed when energy is needed to drive anabolic reactions is the γ phosphate group located the farthest from the ribose sugar it has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either the α  or β phosphate the bonds formed after hydrolysis—or the phosphorylation of a residue by atp—are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of atp during enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of atp or phosphorylation by atp the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work  
any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy if the cell maintained their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction name nicholls  however as is the case with most polymeric biomolecules the breakdown of rna dna and atp into simpler monomers is driven by both energy release and entropy increase considerations in both standard concentrations and also those concentrations encountered within the cell
the standard amount of energy released from hydrolysis of atp can be calculated from the changes in energy under non natural standard conditions then correcting to biological concentrations the net change in heat energy  at  of the decomposition of atp into hydrated adp and hydrated inorganic phosphate is −305ampnbsp with a change in  of 34ampnbspkj mol  the energy released by cleaving either a phosphate psubi sub or pyrophosphate ppsubi sub unit from atp at  of 1ampnbspm are 
atp +  → adp + psubi sub  Δg˚   −305ampnbspkj mol −73ampnbspkcal mol
atp +  → amp + ppsubi sub  Δg˚   −456ampnbspkj mol −109ampnbspkcal mol
these values can be used to calculate the change in energy under physiological conditions and the cellular atp adp ratio however a more representative value which takes amp into consideration called the  is increasingly being employed the values given for the  for this reaction are dependent on a number of factors including overall ionic strength and the presence of  ions such as  and  under typical cellular conditions Δg is approximately −57ampnbspkj mol −14ampnbspkcal mol 
atp adenosine triphosphate has multiple groups with different s in neutral solution atp is ionized exists mostly as atpsup4− sup with a small proportion of atpsup3− sup name storer  as atp has several negatively charged groups in neutral solution it can  metals with very high affinity the  for various metal ions are given as per mole as  9 554  13  3 722  8  1 381 and  25  due to the strength of these interactions atp exists in the cell mostly in a complex with  name storer  
the atp  inside the cell is typically 1–10 
  atp can be produced by  reactions using simple and complex sugars s or s as an energy source for complex fuels to be synthesized into atp they first need to be broken down into smaller more simple molecules carbohydrates are  into simple sugars such as  and  fats s are metabolised to give  and 
the overall process of oxidizing glucose to  is known as  and can produce about 30 molecules of atp from a single molecule of glucose name rich  atp can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes the three main pathways used to generate energy in  organisms are  and the   both components of  and  the majority of this atp production by a non  aerobic eukaryote takes place in the  which can make up nearly 25% of the total volume of a typical cell name lodish 
in glycolysis glucose and glycerol are metabolized to  via the glycolytic pathway in most organisms this process occurs in the  but in some protozoa such as the s this is carried out in a specialized  called the   glycolysis generates a net two molecules of atp through  catalyzed by two enzymes  and  two molecules of  are also produced which can be oxidized via the  and result in the generation of additional atp by  the pyruvate generated as an end product of glycolysis is a substrate for the  name voet 
in the  pyruvate is oxidized by the  to acetyl group which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle also known as the krebs cycle every turn of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of  one molecule of the atp equivalent  gtp through  catalyzed by  three molecules of the reduced   and one molecule of the reduced coenzyme  both of these latter molecules are recycled to their oxidized states nadsup+ sup and  respectively via the  which generates additional atp by  the oxidation of an nadh molecule results in the synthesis of 2–3 atp molecules and the oxidation of one fadhsub2 sub yields between 1–2 atp molecules name rich  the majority of cellular atp is generated by this process although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular  it is an obligately  process because  is needed to recycle the reduced nadh and fadhsub2 sub to their oxidized states in the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available nadsup+ sup and fad name lodish 
the generation of atp by the mitochondrion from cytosolic nadh relies on the  and to a lesser extent the  because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to nadh and nadsup+ sup instead of transferring the generated nadh a  enzyme converts  to  which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix another malate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction producing oxaloacetate and nadh from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrions interior store of nadsup+ sup a  converts the oxaloacetate to  for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space name lodish   will put the antiporter full cycle in the shuttle article  
in oxidative phosphorylation the passage of electrons from nadh and fadhsub2 sub through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space this creates a  that is the net effect of a  gradient and an  gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane flow of protons down this potential gradientampnbsp— that is from the intermembrane space to the matrixampnbsp— provides the driving force for atp synthesis by  this  contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during atp synthesis 
most of the atp synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix the inner membrane contains an  the  atp translocase which is an  used to exchange newly synthesized atp in the matrix for  in the intermembrane space name brandolin  this translocase is driven by the membrane potential as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside however it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate partially dissipating the proton gradient
fatty acids can also be broken down to  by  each round of this cycle reduces the length of the acyl chain by two carbon atoms and produces one nadh and one fadhsub2 sub molecule which are used to generate atp by oxidative phosphorylation because nadh and fadhsub2 sub are energy rich molecules dozens of atp molecules can be generated by the beta oxidation of a single long acyl chain the high energy yield of this process and the compact storage of fat explain why it is the most dense source of dietary s 
 entails the generation of energy via the process of  in the absence of a respiratory  in most eukaryotes glucose is used as both an energy store and an electron donor the equation for the oxidation of glucose to  is
 math\to math 2 + 2 atp
anaerobic respiration is the process of respiration using an  other than  in prokaryotes multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration these include   or carbon dioxide these processes lead to the ecologically important processes of  sulfate reduction and  respectively  
atp can also be synthesized through several so called replenishment reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of s ndks which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high energy phosphate donor and the  family
in plants atp is synthesized in  of the  during the s of  in a process called photophosphorylation here light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane this produces a proton motive force and this drives the atp synthase exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation  some of the atp produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the  which produces  sugars
the total quantity of atp in the human body is about 02ampnbsp the majority of atp is not usually  but is generated from  by the aforementioned processes thus at any given time the total amount of atp +  remains fairly constant
the energy used by human cells requires the  of 100 to 150ampnbspmoles of atp daily which is around 50 to 75ampnbspkg a human will typically use up his or her body weight of atp over the course of the day name di carlo  this means that each atp molecule is recycled 500 to 750 times during a single day 100   02   500 atp cannot be stored hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis however a total of around 5g of atp is used by cell processes at any time in the body
atp production in an aerobic eukaryotic cell is tightly regulated by  mechanisms by  effects and by the substrate concentration dependence of individual enzymes within the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions
in glycolysis  is directly inhibited by its product glucose 6 phosphate and  is inhibited by atp itself the main control point for the glycolytic pathway is  pfk which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of atp and activated by high concentrations of amp the inhibition of pfk by atp is unusual since atp is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by pfk the biologically active form of the enzyme is a  that exists in two possible conformations only one of which binds the second substrate fructose 6 phosphate f6p the protein has two s for atpampnbsp— the  is accessible in either protein conformation but atp binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds f6p poorly name voet   a number of other small molecules can compensate for the atp induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate pfk including   ions inorganic phosphate and fructose 16 and 26 biphosphate name voet 
the citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates particularly the ratio of nadsup+ sup to nadh and the concentrations of  inorganic phosphate atp  and amp  — the molecule that gives its name to the cycleampnbsp— is a feedback inhibitor of  and also inhibits pfk providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis name voet 
in oxidative phosphorylation the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by  which is regulated by the availability of its substrate—the reduced form of  the amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates
math
\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{nadh} + \mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}} + \mathrm{adp} + p_i \iff \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{nad^{+}} + \mathrm{cyt~c_{red}} + \mathrm{atp}
 math
which directly implies this equation
math
\frac{\mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}}{\mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}}   \left\frac{\mathrm{nadh}}{\mathrm{nad}^{+}}\right^{\frac{1}{2}}\left\frac{\mathrm{adp} p_i}{\mathrm{atp}}\rightk_{eq}
 math
thus a high ratio of nadh to nadsup+ sup or a high ratio of adp psubi sub to atp imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity name voet  an additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of atp and nadh between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm name brandolin 
atp is consumed in the cell by energy requiring endergonic processes and can be generated by energy releasing exergonic processes in this way atp transfers energy between spatially separate  atp is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions this includes the synthesis of macromolecules including  and  see below and  atp also plays a critical role in the  of macromolecules across cell membranes eg  and 
atp is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the  in a related process atp is required for the  required for  this latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for  and 
 
atp is also a  atp adp or adenosine are recognised by  purinoreceptors might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues name abbracchio09 
in humans this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system name harvard  activity dependent release of atp from synapses axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as p2  the  receptors are metabotropic ie  and modulate mainly intracellular calcium and sometimes cyclic amp levels though named between p2ysub1 sub and p2ysub15 sub only nine members of the p2y family have been cloned and some are only related through weak homology and several p2ysub5 sub p2ysub7 sub p2ysub9 sub p2ysub10 sub do not function as receptors that raise cytosolic calcium the  ionotropic receptor subgroup comprises seven members p2xsub1 sub–p2xsub7 sub which are ligand gated  permeable ion channels that open when bound to an extracellular purine nucleotide in contrast to p2 receptors agonist order atp    amp  ado purinergic nucleoside triphosphates like atp are not strong agonists of p1 receptors which are strongly activated by  and other s ado  amp    atp p1 receptors have a1 a2a a2b and a3 subtypes a as a remnant of old nomenclature of adenosine receptor all of which are g protein coupled receptors a1 and a3 being coupled to gi and a2a and a2b being coupled to gs 
  this is an awful lot of detail on the receptors without a lot of information on the function of the receptors and their importance  
all adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen activated protein kinases the actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of atp in the cns adenosine has multiple functions such as modulation of neural development neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems name abbracchio09 
 
atp is critical in  processes it is used by s as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions kinase activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction  of a protein by a kinase can activate this cascade such as the  cascade 
atp is also used by  and is transformed to the  molecule cyclic amp which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores  this form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes 
in all known organisms the deoxyribonucleotides that make up  are synthesized by the action of  rnr enzymes on their corresponding  name stubbe  these enzymes reduce the sugar residue from  to  by removing oxygen from the 2  group the substrates are ribonucleoside diphosphates and the products deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates the latter are denoted dadp dcdp dgdp and dudp respectively all ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common   mechanism reliant on reactive  residues that oxidize to form s in the course of the reaction name stubbe  rnr enzymes are recycled by reaction with  or  name voet  
the regulation of rnr and related enzymes maintains a balance of dntps relative to each other and relative to ntps in the cell very low dntp concentration inhibits  and  and is lethal to the cell while an abnormal ratio of dntps is ic due to the increased likelihood of the  incorporating the wrong dntp during dna synthesis name voet   regulation of or differential specificity of rnr has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dntp pools under cellular stress such as  name chimploy 
in the synthesis of the   adenosine derived from atp is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into rna molecules by s the energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate two phosphate groups  the process is similar in dna biosynthesis except that atp is reduced to the  datp before incorporation into dna
aminoacyl trna synthetase enzymes utilise atp as an energy source to attach a trna molecule to its specific amino acid forming an aminoacyl trna complex ready for  at s the energy is made available by atp hydrolysis to  amp as two phosphate groups are removed
amino acid activation ers to the attachment of an amino acid to its transfer rna trna
    aminoacyl transferase binds adenosine triphosphate atp to amino acid pp is released
    aminoacyl transferase binds amp amino acid to trna the amp is used in this step
during amino acid activation the amino acids aa are attached to their corresponding trna the coupling reactions are catalysed by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl trna synthetases named after the reaction product aminoacyl trna or aa trna the coupling reaction proceeds in two steps
1 aa + atp aa amp + pp pyrophosphate 2 aa amp + trna aa trna + amp
the amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3’ end of the trna the a in the sequence cca via an ester bond roll over in illustration the formation of the ester bond conserves a considerable part of the energy from the activation reaction this stored energy provides the majority of the energy needed for peptide bond formation during translation
each of the 20 amino acids are recognized by its specific aminoacyl trna synthetase the synthetases are usually composed of one to four protein subunits the enzymes vary considerably in structure although they all perform the same type of reaction by binding atp one specific amino acid and its corresponding trna
the specificity of the amino acid activation is as critical for the translational accuracy as the correct matching of the codon with the anticodon the reason is that the ribosome only sees the anticodon of the trna during translation thus the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between trnas with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids
the error frequency of the amino acid activation reaction is approximately 1 in 10 000 despite the small structural differences between some of the amino acidseldra p solomon linda r berg diana w martin biology 8th ed isbn 978 0 495 30978 9 
some proteins that bind atp do so in a characteristic  known as the  which is a general  binding  that can also bind the    the most common atp binding proteins known as  share a small number of common folds the s the largest kinase superfamily all share common structural features specialized for atp binding and phosphate transfer name scheeff 
atp in complexes with proteins in general requires the presence of a   almost always  which binds to the atp phosphate groups the presence of magnesium greatly decreases the  of atp from its protein binding partner without affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the atp has bound name saylor  the presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation name lin 
biochemistry laboratories often use  studies to explore atp dependent molecular processes s of atp dependent enzymes such as s are needed to examine the s and s involved in atp dependent reactions atp analogs are also used in  to determine a  in complex with atp often together with other substrates
most useful atp analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as atp would be instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the atp bound state adenosine 5 gamma thiotriphosphate is an extremely common atp analog in which one of the gamma phosphate oxygens is replaced by a  atom this molecule is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than atp itself and functions as an inhibitor of atp dependent processes in crystallographic studies hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound  ion however caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using atp analogs since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration name resetar

the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors these include  the location of infection and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial name pankey2004  a bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells name bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary phase and nondividing staphylococcus aureus cells  these findings are based on laboratory studies and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection name pankey2004   since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration name rhee2004  in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the  and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial name pankey2004  name agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration micof antimicrobial substances 
to predict clinical outcome the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its  profile and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy 
antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action chemical structure or spectrum of activity most target bacterial functions or growth processes name calderin2007  those that target the bacterial cell wall s and s or the cell membrane  or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes s s s and  have  activities those that target protein synthesis s  and s are usually  with the exception of bactericidal s name the importance of bactericidal drugs future directions in infectious disease  further categorization is based on their target specificity narrow spectrum antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria such as  or  bacteria whereas broad spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria following a 40 year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s cyclic  such as   such as  s such as  and s such as cunha ba antibiotic essentials 2009 jones amp bartlett learning isbn 978 0 7637 7219 2 p 180 for example  
with advances in  most modern antibacterials are  modifications of various natural compounds  these include for example the  which include the s produced by fungi in the genus  the s and the s compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the s whereas other antibacterials—for example the  the s and the s—are produced solely by  in accordance with this many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical  origin into natural semisynthetic and synthetic another classification system is based on biological activity in this classification antibacterials are divided into two broad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms  agents kill bacteria and s slow down or stall bacterial growth
many antibacterial compounds are relatively s with a  of less than 2000 s
since the first pioneering efforts of  and  in 1939 the importance of antibiotics including antibacterials to  has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria production of the active compounds is carried out using  usually in strongly aerobic conditions 
oral antibiotics are taken by mouth whereas  administration may be used in more serious cases  such as deep seated s antibiotics may also sometimes be administered ly as with s or s
the topical antibiotics are 
 erythromycin
 clindamycin
 gentamycin
 tetracycline
 meclocycline
 sodium sulfacetamide
while topical medications that act as comedolytics as well as antibiotics are
 benzoyl peroxide
 azelaic acid
antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated however some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse  name pmid15993671 
side effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used the microbial organisms targeted and the individual patient safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use name pmid15993671  adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions including  and anaphylaxis common side effects include  resulting from disruption of the species composition in the  resulting for example in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as   antibacterials can also affect the  and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus  in the vulvo vaginal area name pirotta and garland  additional side effects can result from interaction with other drugs such as elevated risk of  damage from administration of a  antibiotic with a systemic  some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with   
the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with s name weaver1999  such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low about 1% name pmid10384856  in cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills such as for the broad spectrum antibacterial  these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes causing increased breakdown of the pills active ingredients name weaver1999  effects on the intestinal flora which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon have also been suggested but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial name pmid3155374  name pmid2256523  clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives name weaver1999 
interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy name bmj  name antibiotics and alcohol 
it is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medication however it is unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics however there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol should be avoided completely because of serious side effects name nhs  
theore potential risks of side effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered despite the lack of a categorical counterindication the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread
antibiotics such as       and  cause a  like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by  which may result in vomiting nausea and shortness of breath name nhs 
other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound name antibiotics faq  in addition serum levels of doxycycline and  succinate two bacteriostatic antibiotics see above may be reduced by alcohol consumption resulting in reduced efficacy and diminished pharmacotherapeutic effect name  stockley2002 
the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon emergence of resistance often lects ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy the antibiotic treatment may  for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics under certain conditions it may result in perential growth of resistant bacteria while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug name balancing the drug resistance equation  for example antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the  name mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance  antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains have become less effective due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains name voanewscom 
resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals such as sulfamethazine degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces 
the survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance name witte2004  but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through  horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use name a field guide to bacteria the world of bacteria 
antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost thereby reducing  of resistant strains which can limit the spread of antibacterial resistant bacteria for example in the absence of antibacterial compounds additional mutations however may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria name the biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance any practical conclusions 
paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms name dcosta2011  useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability name gladki2013 
several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains name alekshun2007  for example an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial  acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra chromosomal dna name alekshun2007  antibacterial producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to and may have been transferred to antibacterial resistant strains name glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide producing organisms  name multidrug resistance in bacteria  the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by  name witte2004  for instance antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via  that carry these resistance genes name witte2004  name baker2006  plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials name baker2006  cross resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound name baker2006 
antibacterial resistant strains and species sometimes erred to as superbugs now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled for example emergent bacterial strains causing  tb that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges every year nearly half a million new cases of  mdr tb are estimated to occur worldwidehttp  wwwwhoint mediacentre news releases 2009 tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402 en indexhtml health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug resistant tb world health organization who  for example  is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of  antibacterials name are you ready for a world without antibiotics  the united kingdoms  has stated that most isolates with ndm 1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections name health protection report 
per the the icu book the first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them and the second rule is try not to use too many of them name marino 
inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria  of antibiotics is an example of misuse name larson2007  many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment also incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections name pmid15993671  name larson2007  the overuse of antibiotics like penicillin and erythromycin has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s name voanewscom  name hawkey2008  widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics name hawkey2008 
common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of  antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patients weight and history of prior use other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic incorrect dosage and administration or failure to rest for sufficient recovery inappropriate antibiotic treatment for example is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the  one study on s found physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them name pmid17467120  multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics name pmid17509729  name cochrane review on shared decision making and antibiotics prescription 
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics name larson2007  the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance and is coordinated by the us  the  fda and the  nih as well as other us agencies name pharmguide  an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working name keep antibiotics working  in france an antibiotics are not automatic government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions especially in children 
the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970 swann report 1969 and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth promotional agents since 2003 name urlregulation ec no 1831 2003 of the european parliament and of the council  moreover several organizations eg the american society for microbiology asm american public health association apha and the american medical association ama have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses  however commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them two federal bills s742 name usbill1  and hr 2562 name usbill2  aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in us food animals were proposed but have not passed name usbill1  name usbill2  these bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations including the american holistic nurses association the american medical association and the american public health association apha 
there has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry in the united states the question of emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains due to  was raised by the us  fda in 1977 in march 2012 the united states district court for the southern district of new york ruling in an action brought by the  and others ordered the fda to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated fda regulations name mpfda 
the increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of bacterial disease treatment strategies that are alternatives to conventional antibacterials
one strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials for example some resistance modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms such as  from the cell thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial targets include
 the  phe arg β naphthylamide 
 s such as  and 
metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active 
s rely on  modulation or augmentation vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection leading to the activation of  the production of   and other classic immune reactions antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases  vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic cell free vaccines consisting of purified components including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates to protein carriers as well as inactivated toxins toxoids and proteins name milleraamillerpf 
 is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria the way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses more specifically s bacteriophages also known simply as phages are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium s name sulakvelidze  by disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium phages destroy their metabolism which eventually results in the cells death name sulakvelidze  phages will insert their dna into the bacterium allowing their dna to be transcribed once their dna is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released the cell will lyse name sulakvelidze  one of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings however studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria name sulakvelidze 
some over the counter  supplements containing polyphenols such as  demonstrate  anti bacterial properties   
in april 2013 the  idsa reported that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria’s increasing ability to develop resistance since 2009 only 2 new antibiotics were approved in the united states the number of new antibiotics approved for marketing per year declines continuously the report identified seven antibiotics against the  gnb currently in  or  clinical trials however these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of resistance of gnb  name idsa2013

possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by fda furthermore appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor name idsa2013    adapt act aims to fast track the drug development to combat the growing threat of superbugs under this act fda can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials the  will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance and publish the data the fda antibiotics labeling process susceptibility test interpretive criteria for microbial organisms or breakpoints will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals   according to allan coukell senior director for health programs at the pew charitable trusts by allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets and clarifying fdas authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk benefit calculation adapt would make the clinical trials more feasible

schwarzenegger began  at the age of 15 he won the  title at age 20 and went on to win the  contest seven times schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written many books and articles on the sport he is widely considered to be among the greatest bodybuilders of all times as well as its  biggest icon  schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a  action film icon schwarzeneggers breakthrough film was the  epic  in 1982 which was a box office hit and resulted in a  name katzfilm   in 1984 he appeared in s science fiction thriller film  which was a massive critical and box office success schwarzenegger subsequently reprised the  character in the  later installments in   and  name katzfilm   name profilear   name fanleam  he appeared in a number of successful films such as  1985  1987  1987  1988  1990  1990 and  1994 he was nicknamed the austrian oak in his bodybuilding days arnie during his acting career and the governator a  of  and  one of his best known movie roles
as a  he was first elected on october 7 2003 in a special  to replace then governor  schwarzenegger was sworn in on november 17 to serve the remainder of daviss term schwarzenegger was then re elected on november 7 2006 in  to serve a full term as governor defeating   who was  at the time schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on january 5 2007  in 2011 schwarzenegger completed his second term as governor
schwarzenegger was born in  a village bordering the city of  in  and christened arnold alois name lifeline  his parents were  august 17 1907 – december 13 1972 and aurelia schwarzenegger née jadrny july 29 1922 – august 2 1998 gustav was the local chief of police and had served in world war ii as a  after voluntarily joining the  in 1938 name nazi  though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of  he married arnolds mother on october 20 1945– he was 38 and she was 23 years old according to schwarzenegger both of his parents were very strict back then in austria it was a very different world if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents the rod was not spared name askarnold1   he grew up in a roman catholic family who attended  every sunday name tmas  
gustav had a perence for his elder son meinhard july 17 1946 – may 20 1971 over arnold name governg2  his favoritism was strong and blatant which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that arnold was not his biological child name wl  schwarzenegger has said his father had no patience for listening or understanding your problems name tmas   schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death  in later life schwarzenegger commissioned the  to research his fathers wartime record which came up with no evidence of gustavs being involved in atrocities despite gustavs membership in the nazi party and  name governg2   schwarzeneggers fathers background received wide press attention during the 2003  campaign  at school schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his cheerful good humored and exuberant character name tmas   money was a problem in their household schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a rigerator name wl  
as a boy schwarzenegger played several sports heavily influenced by his father name tmas   he picked up his first barbell in 1960 when his  coach took his team to a local gym name lifeline   at the age of 14 he chose  over soccer as a career name katzfilm  name profilear  schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting i actually started weight training when i was 15 but id been participating in sports like soccer for years so i felt that although i was slim i was well developed at least enough so that i could start going to the gym and start olympic lifting name askarnold1   however his official website biography claims at 14 he started an intensive training program with dan farmer studied psychology at 15 to learn more about the power of mind over body and at 17 officially started his competitive career name mrever  during a speech in 2001 he said my own plan formed when i was 14 years old my father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was my mother wanted me to go to trade school name per  schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in graz where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as   and  on the big screen name askarnold1   when reeves died in 2000 schwarzenegger fondly remembered him as a teenager i grew up with steve reeves his remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didnt always understand my dreams steve reeves has been part of everything ive ever been fortunate enough to achieve in 1961 schwarzenegger met former mr austria kurt marnul who invited him to train at the gym in graz name lifeline   he was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends when it was usually closed so that he could train it would make me sick to miss a workout i knew i couldnt look at myself in the mirror the next morning if i didnt do it name askarnold1   when schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy he replied i was very young but i remember my father taking me to the austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels the first real movie i saw that i distinctly remember was a  movie name askarnold1 
on may 20 1971 his brother meinhard died in a car accident name lifeline   meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral name wl   meinhard was due to marry erika knapp and the couple had a three year old son patrick schwarzenegger would pay for patricks education and help him to emigrate to the united states name wl   gustav died the following year from a stroke name lifeline   in  schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his fathers funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest later he and the films producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport and to make schwarzeneggers image more cold and machine like in order to fan controversy for the filminterview in pumping ironampnbsp– 25th anniversary edition dvd extras  barbara baker his first serious girlfriend has said he informed her of his fathers death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother name dt2  over time he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his fathers funeral name wl  
in an interview with  in 2004 schwarzenegger told how he suffered what would now be called child abuse at the hands of his father my hair was pulled i was hit with belts so was the kid next door it was just the way it was many of the children ive seen were broken by their parents which was the german austrian mentality they didnt want to create an individual it was all about conforming i was one who did not conform and whose will could not be broken theore i became a rebel every time i got hit and every time someone said you cant do this i said this is not going to be for much longer because im going to move out of here i want to be rich i want to be somebody name nazi

adam smiths discontent at oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in glasgow  hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations which he sometimes opened to the public his lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet the preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially er to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson – a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend  and influential mentor scott wampnbspr the never to be forgotten hutcheson excerpts from wampnbspr scott econ journal watch 81 96–109 january 2011http  econjwatchorg articles the never to be forgotten hutcheson excerpts from wr scott

following the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at glasgow to learn under smith  after the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith began to give more attention to  and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals  for example smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver which is the basis for  the  that dominated western european economic policies at the time

in 1759 smith published his first work the theory of moral sentiments he continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his death although the wealth of nations is widely regarded as smiths most influential work it is believed that smith himself considered the theory of moral sentiments to be a superior work 
in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments  his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience

very differently classical economists see in smiths first sentences his programme to promote the wealth of nations taking up the  concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1 theore the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth this is what smith had heard in france from among others  to this french insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the  smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living smiths central message is theore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures the wealth of nations smiths argument predicted britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors the opening sentences of the wealth of nations summarise this policy

classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the  later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of s major work capital was published in german in 1867 in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital name roemer 1987 marxian value analysis  v 3 383  1987 marx karl heinrich the new palgrave a dictionary of economics v 3 pp 372 376  the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of  that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing

some commentators have argued that smiths works show support for a progressive not flat income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them  and tax on rent  yet smith argued for the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their economic revenue by any capitation the wealth of nations viik1 smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting justice and certain publick institutions that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise the wealth of nations ivix51
additionally smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in the wealth of nations book v ch i included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system grant patents and copy rights provide public goods such as infrastructure provide national defence and regulate banking it was the role of the government to provide goods of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual such as roads bridges canals and harbours he also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies he supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society in such cases however smith argued for local rather than centralised control even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves    are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local and provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state wealth of nations vid18 finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate such that they are equal or above the public in fashion he even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion house of a   in addition he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial

it is generally accepted that lavoisiers great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role  plays in  he recognized and named  1778 and  1783 and opposed the  lavoisier helped construct the  wrote the first extensive  and helped to orm  he predicted the existence of  1787in his table of the elements lavoisier listed five salifiable earths ie ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts salis   salt in latin  chaux calcium oxide magnésie magnesia magnesium oxide baryte barium sulfate alumine alumina aluminum oxide and silice silica silicon dioxide about these elements lavoisier speculates  we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses are incapable hitherto of being reduced to a metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds are confounded with earths it is extremely probable that barytes which we have just now arranged with earths is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds irreducible by any hitherto known process – from https  booksgooglecom booksid adykaaaaiaajamppg pa218#v onepageampqampf false page 218 of   lavoisier with robert kerr trans elements of chemistry  4th ed edinburgh scotland william creech 1799  the original passage appears in lavoisier traité Élémentaire de chimie   paris france cuchet 1789 vol 1 https  booksgooglecom booksid hzch3yorayucamppg pa174#v onepageampqampf false page 174  and was also the first to establish that  was an element 1777 rather than a compoundcmichael hogan 2011 http  wwweoearthorg article sulfurtopic 49557 sulfur encyclopedia of earth eds a jorgensen and cjcleveland national council for science and the environment washington dc  he discovered that although matter may change its form or shape 
lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of  councils and an administrator of the  the ferme générale was one of the most hated components of the  because of the profits it took at the expense of the state the secrecy of the terms of its contracts and the violence of its armed agents  all of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research at the height of the  he was accused by  of selling adulterated  and of other crimes and was eventually  a year after marats death
antoine laurent lavoisier was born to a wealthy family in paris on 26 august 1743 the son of an attorney at the parliament of paris he inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother  lavoisier began his schooling at the   known as the collège mazarin in paris in 1754 at the age of 11 in his last two years 1760–1761 at the school his scientific interests were aroused and he studied    and mathematics in the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of  a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation an enthusiasm which never left him lavoisier entered the school of law where he received a bachelors degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764 lavoisier received a  and was admitted to the  but never practiced as a lawyer however he continued his scientific education in his spare time
lavoisiers education was filled with the ideals of the french  of the time and he was fascinated by s dictionary of chemistry he attended lectures in the natural sciences lavoisiers devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by  a prominent french scholar of the 18th century his first chemical publication appeared in 1764 from 1763 to 1767 he studied geology under  in collaboration with guettard lavoisier worked on a geological survey of  in june 1767 in 1764 he read his first paper to the  frances most elite scientific society on the chemical and physical properties of  hydrated  and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the king for an essay on the problems of urban  in 1768 lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the academy of sciences in 1769 he worked on the first geological map of france
at the age of 26 around the time he was elected to the academy of sciences lavoisier bought a share in the  a  financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes his participation in the french government and the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the  began in france as taxes and poor government orm were the primary motivators during the french revolution lavoisier attempted to introduce orms in the french  and taxation system to help the peasants while in government work he helped develop the  to secure uniformity of  throughout france lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when in 1771 at age 28 he married  the 13 year old daughter of a senior member of the ferme généralehttp  wwwcnrsfr cw dossiers doslavoisier contenu alternative alter2_texteshtml lavoisier le parcours dun scientifique révolutionnaire  she was to play an important part in lavoisiers scientific career—notably she translated english documents for him including s essay on phlogiston and s research in addition she assisted him in the laboratory and created many  and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works
madame lavoisier edited and published antoines memoirs whether any english translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry  for 3 years following his entry into the ferme générale lavoisiers scientific activity diminished somewhat for much of his time was taken up with official ferme générale business he did however present one important memoir to the academy of sciences during this period on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation by a very precise quantitative experiment lavoisier showed that the earthy sediment produced after long continued lux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water
during late 1772 lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of  the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science he reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the academy on 20 october in which he reported that when  burned it combined with a large quantity of air to produce  and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning in a second sealed note deposited with the academy a few weeks later 1 november lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of  and went on to add that what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination and i am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause
 
during 1773 lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air particularly fixed air and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field he published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled opuscules physiques et chimiques physical and chemical essays in the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of  the scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali for example   and the caustic form for example   lay in the fact that the former contained fixed air not common air fixed in the chalk but a distinct chemical species now understood to be  cosub2 sub which was a constituent of the atmosphere lavoisier recognized that blacks fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with the charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be blacks fixed air that is cosub2 sub
 
in the spring of 1774 lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air but the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air in october the english chemist  visited paris where he met lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the  of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance the result was his famous memoir on the nature of the principle which combines with metals during their calcination and increases their weight read to the academy on 26 april 1775 commonly erred to as the easter memoir in the original memoir lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with  giving off blacks fixed air in the process name in frenchhttp  wwwlavoisiercnrsfr ice ice_page_detailphplang framptype textampbdd lavosieramptable lavoisierampbookid 26amptypeofbookdes memoiresamppageorder 1ampfacsimile offampsearch no in french and http  weblemoyneedu ~giunta lavoisier1html memoir on combustion in general english translation  when reduced without charcoal it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way he concluded that this was just a pure form of common air and that it was the air itself undivided without alteration without decomposition which combined with metals on calcination
after returning from paris priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx his results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration inflammation and  every other use of common air he called the air dephlogisticated air as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston since it was theore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained
 
the official version of lavoisiers easter memoir appeared in 1778 in the intervening period lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of priestleys latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own in addition to studying priestleys dephlogisticated air he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined he showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties thus when the revised version of the easter memoir was published in 1778 lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air or the eminently respirable part of the air in the following year lavoisier coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air from the greek words meaning acid former name in french  and considérations générales sur la nature des acides general considerations on the nature of acids 1778http  wwwlavoisiercnrsfr ice ice_page_detailphplang framptype textampbdd lavosieramptable lavoisierampbookid 31amptypeofbookdes amppageorder 1ampfacsimile offampsearch no in french  he was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur phosphorus charcoal and nitrogen were acidic he held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was theore the acidifying principle
 
lavoisiers chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion in 1783 he read to the academy his famous paper entitled réflexions sur le phlogistique reflections on phlogiston a full scale attack on the current  of combustion that year lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of s inflammable air which lavoisier termed   for water former with dephlogisticated air oxygen by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases all of the researchers noted the production of water but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory in cooperation with mathematician  lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury the quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element as had been thought for over 2000 years but a compound of two gases hydrogen and oxygen
lavoisiers researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties especially in connection with the ferme générale there were also innumerable reports for and committees of the academy of sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government lavoisier whose organizing skills were outstanding frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports in 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company similar to the ferme générale which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying france with its munitions requirements as a result of his efforts both the quantity and quality of french  greatly improved and it became a source of revenue for the government his appointment to the gunpowder commission brought one great benefit to lavoisiers scientific career as well as a commissioner he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the royal arsenal here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792

lavoisier together with   and  submitted a new program for the orms of  to the academy in 1787 for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time the new system was tied inextricably to lavoisiers new oxygen theory of chemistry the  of earth air fire and water were discarded and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements the elements included light  matter of heat the principles of oxygen hydrogen and azote  carbon sulfur phosphorus the yet unknown radicals of muriatic acid   and fluoric acid 17 metals 5 earths mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as   and  three alkalies   and  and the radicals of 19 organic acids the acids regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids phosphoric and phosphorus acids nitric and nitrous acids the ic termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the ous ending similarly salts of the ic acids were given the terminal letters ate as in copper sulfate whereas the salts of the ous acids terminated with the suffix ite as in copper sulfite the total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name  with the old term vitriol of venus lavoisier described this system of nomenclature in méthode de nomenclature chimique method of chemical nomenclature 1787
lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his  elementary treatise on chemistry published in 1789 this work represents the synthesis of lavoisiers contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern  on the subject the core of the work was the oxygen theory and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines it presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry contained a clear statement of the law of  and denied the existence of phlogiston this text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis and presented lavoisiers theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements it remains a classic in the history of science while many leading chemists of the time used to accept lavoisiers new ideas demand for traité élémentaire as a textbook in edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into english within about a year of its french publicationsee the advertisement p vi of kerrs translation and pp xxvi–xxvii xxviii of douglas mckies introduction to the dover edition  in any event the traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation
the relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes lavoisier was almost obliged theore to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of  his first memoirs on this topic were read to the academy of sciences in 1777 but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782 1783 in association with  the result of this work was published in a famous memoir on heat lavoisier and laplace designed an ice  apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration the outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow which melted to maintain a constant temperature of  around an inner shell filled with ice by measuring the quantity of  and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process lavoisier stated la respiration est donc une combustion that is respiratory gas exchange is a combustion like that of a candle burninghttp  wwwajcnorg cgi content full 79 5 899s is a calorie a calorie american journal of clinical nutrition vol 79 no 5 899s–906s may 2004 
this continuous slow combustion which they supposed took place in the lungs enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789–1790 in cooperation with  they designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body  and respiration using seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the revolution but lavoisiers pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come
as the  gained momentum from 1789 on lavoisiers world inexorably collapsed around him attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular ferme générale and it was eventually suppressed in 1791 in 1792 lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the gunpowder commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the royal arsenal on 8 august 1793 all the learned societies including the academy of sciences were suppressed
it is difficult to assess lavoisiers own attitude to the political turmoil like so many intellectual liberals he felt that the  could be ormed from the inside if only reason and moderation prevailed characteristically one of his last major works was a proposal to the  for the orm of french education he tried to remain aloof from the political cockpit no doubt fearful and uncomprehending of the violence he saw therein however on 24 november 1793 the arrest of all the former tax gatherers was ordered he was branded a traitor by the convention under  during the  in 1794 actions such as attacking distinguished academics such as antoine lavoisier helped to establish robespierre as a tyrant and intolerant of progress eventually this would be one of the keys to his downfall lavoisier had also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign born scientists including mathematician  which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom  lavoisier was tried convicted and guillotined on 8 may 1794 in paris at the age of 50 along with his 27 co defendantshttp  wwwappcom viewart 20130508 njnews18 305080042 today history today in history 1794 antoine lavoisier the father of modern chemistry is executed on the guillotine during france’s reign of terror 
according to a probably apocryphal story the appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge la république na pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes  le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu the republic needs neither scientists nor chemists the course of justice cannot be delayed
commenting on this quotation denis duveen an english expert on lavoiser and a collector of his works wrote that it is pretty certain that it was never uttered for duveens evidence see the following   lavoisier was convicted with summary justice of having plundered the people and the treasury of france of having adulterated the nations tobacco with water and of having supplied the enemies of france with huge sums of money from the national treasury
lavoisiers importance to science was expressed by  who lamented the beheading by saying il ne leur a fallu qu’un moment pour faire tomber cette tête et cent années peut être ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable it took them only an instant to cut off this head and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like  
 
a year and a half after his death lavoisier was exonerated by the french government during the   his private belongings were delivered to his widow a brief note was included reading to the widow of lavoisier who was falsely convicted
about a century after his death a statue of lavoisier was erected in paris it was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied lavoisiers head for the statue but used a spare head of the  the secretary of the academy of sciences during lavoisiers last years lack of money prevented alterations from being made the statue was melted down during the second world war and has not since been replaced however one of the main s high schools in paris and a street in the  are named after lavoisier and statues of him are found on the  and on the façade of the cour napoléon of the  his name is one of the  of eminent french scientists engineers and mathematicians inscribed on the  as well as on buildings around killian court at  in  us
lavoisier is  and as such he defended his faith against those who attempted to use science to attack it louis edouard grimaux author of the standard french biography of lavoisier and the first biographer to obtain access to lavoisiers papers writes the following blockquoteraised in a pious family which had given many priests to the church he had held to his beliefs to  an english author who had sent him a controversial work he wrote you have done a noble thing in upholding revelation and the authenticity of the holy scripture and it is remarkable that you are using for the defense precisely the same weapons which were once used for the attackgrimaux edouard lavoisier 1743–1794 paris 1888 2nd ed 1896 3rd ed 1899 page 53  blockquote
lavoisiers fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory he established the consistent use of the  used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids which later turned out to be erroneous lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with  they used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of  produced eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction
lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory believing that  which function as a single group in a chemical process combine with oxygen in reactions he also introduced the possibility of  when he discovered that diamond is a 
he was essentially a theorist and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure reinforced his own quantitative experiments expounding the true explanation of the results he completed the work of black priestley and cavendish and gave a correct explanation of their experiments
overall his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th centurycharles c gillespie foreword to lavoisier by jean pierre poirier university of pennsylvania press english edition 1996  lavoisiers work was recognized as an  by the   and the  in 1999

hermann kolbe adolph wilhelm hermann kolbe 27 sept 1818–25 nov 1884 was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern  as professor at  and  kolbe coined the term  and contributed to the philosophical demise of  through synthesis of the  acetic acid from  to  via modifications to the idea of radicals and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his  of carboxylate salts the  in the preparation of  and the  after studies with  and  kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in london with  and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the  to be elected to the royal swedish academy of sciences and to win the s davy medal in the year of his death despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists including      etc kolbe is remembered for editing the journal for more than a decade where his rejection of s structure of benzene s theory on the origin of  and s orms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent kolbe died of a heart attack in  at age 68 six years after the death of his wife charlotte he was survived by four children
kolbe was born in elliehausen near   germany as the eldest son of a  pastor at the age of 13 he entered the göttingen gymnasium residing at the home of one of the professors  he obtained the leaving certificate the  six years later  he had become passionate about the study of  matriculating at the  in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist 
in 1842 he became an assistant to  at the  he took his doctoral degree there in 1843  a new opportunity arose in 1845 when he became assistant to  at the new museum of economic geology in london where he became a close friend of   from 1847 he was engaged in editing the handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten chemie dictionary of pure and applied chemistry edited by   and  and he also wrote an important textbook  in 1851 kolbe succeeded bunsen as professor of chemistry at marburg and in 1865 he was called to the  in 1864 he was elected a foreign member of the 
in 1853 he married charlotte the daughter of general major wilhelm von bardeleben his wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage  they had four children
as late as the 1840s and despite  in 1828 some chemists still believed in the doctrine of  according to which a special life force was necessary to create organic ie in its original meaning biologically derived compounds kolbe promoted the idea that s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this organic context directly or indirectly by substitution processes hence while by modern definitions he was converting one  to another by the parlance of his era he was converting inorganic—anorganisch—substances into organic ones only thought accessible through vital processes he validated his theory by converting  to  in several steps 1843–45 kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural  so contributing to the development of  a dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules kolbe was the first person to use the word  in its present day meaning and contributed a number of new chemical reactions
in particular kolbe developed procedures for the  of the salts of  and other s   and prepared  a building block of  in a process called  or   his method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the  and with  he found that s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids
in addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work kolbe oversaw student research at leipzig and especially at marburg students spending time under his tutelage included   known for  predicting the product composition of elimination reactions  discoverer of  compounds s and the   discoverer of the   discoverer of      first to describe s smaller and larger than  and known for  describing addition reactions to alkenes    first to describe the double bond of ethylene  and 
kolbe served for more than a decade as what in modern terms would be understood the senior editor of the  journal of practical chemistry from 1870 to 1884 kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others especially after about 1874 that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness  he was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory
his rejection of structural chemistry especially the theories of the structure of benzene by  the theory of the  by  and the orm of chemical nomenclature by  was expressed in his vituperative articles in the journal für praktische chemie  some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists 
baeyer is an excellent experimentor but he is only an empiricist lacking sense and capability and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science 
the violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation  he died of a heart attack in

   keep this note technical term necessary for wikipedia articles dont assign for wiktionary   
in  an  allomorph is a variant form of a  that is when a unit of meaning varies in sound without changing meaning the term allomorph explains the comprehension of phonological variations for specific morphemes
english has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning examples include the past tense and the plural morphemes
for example in  a past tense morpheme is  ed  it occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a  when following an alveolar stop
as  or  in verbs whose  ends with the alveolar stops  or  such as hunted  or banded 
as  in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than  such as fished 
as  in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than  such as buzzed 
notice the other than restrictions above this is a common fact about allomorphy if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive in this case after an alveolar stop to least restrictive then the first matching case usually wins  thus the above conditions could be re written as follows
as  or   when the stem ends with the alveolar stops  or 
as  when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes
as  elsewhere
the fact that the  allomorph does not appear after stem final  despite the fact that the latter is voiceless is then explained by the fact that  appears in that environment together with the fact that the environments are ordered likewise the fact that the  allomorph does not appear after stem final  is because the earlier clause for the  allomorph takes priority and the fact that the  allomorph does not appear after stem final voiceless phonemes is because the preceding clause for the  takes priority
irregular past tense forms such as broke or was  were can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items such as the verb break which theore take priority over the general cases listed above
allomorphy can also exist in stems or  as in classical

there are three allomorphs of the stem   and   the allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case marking suffixes
the form of the stem  found in the nominative singular and locative plural is the etymological form of the morpheme pre indic palatalization of  resulted in the variant form  which was initially phonologically conditioned this conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form where the  is followed by the high front vowel 
but subsequent merging of  and  into  made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case both singular and plural as well as the nominative plural and instrumental singular hence this allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes
phonological conditioning also accounts for the  form found in the instrumental plural where the  assimilates in voicing to the following 
the term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure it was first applied to language in writing in 1948 by fatih Şat and sibel merve in language xxivoxford english dictionary online entry 50006103 accessed 2006 09 05

in  an allophone  from the  állos other and φωνή phōnē voice sound is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds or  or signs used to pronounce a single  in a particular language name 00qacid  for example  as in pin and  as in spin are allophones for the phoneme  in the  the specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context such allophones are called positional variants but sometimes allophones occur in  replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme will usually not change the meaning of a word although sometimes the result may sound non native or even unintelligible native speakers of a given language usually perceive one phoneme in that language as a single distinctive sound and are both unaware of and even shocked by the allophone variations used to pronounce single phonemes name 89rahec  name 06hozep 
the term allophone was coined by  in the 1940s in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early  theory  the term was popularized by g l trager and  in a 1941 paper on english phonology  and went on to become part of standard usage within the american structuralist tradition 
every time a speech sound is produced for a given phoneme it will be slightly different from other utterances even for the same speaker this has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are see  for details only some of the variation is significant ie detectable or perceivable to speakers there are two types of allophones based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has freedom to unconsciously choose which allophone to use
when a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context ie using a different allophone for a phoneme will cause confusion or make the speaker sound non native the allophones are said to be complementary ie the allophones complement each other and one is not used in a situation where the usage of another is standard in the case of complementary allophones each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a  process name 47qo 
in other cases the speaker is able to select freely from  allophones based on personal habit or perence
a  allophone is sometimes called an allotone for example in the neutral tone of 
 
there are many allophonic processes in english like lack of plosion nasal plosion partial devoicing of sonorants complete devoicing of sonorants partial devoicing of obstruents lengthening and shortening vowels and retraction
  – strong explosion of breath in english a voiceless plosive that is p t or k is aspirated whenever it stands as the only consonant at the beginning of the stressed syllable or of the first stressed or unstressed syllable in a word for example  as in pin and  as in spin are allophones for the phoneme  because they cannot distinguish words in fact they occur in  english speakers treat them as the same sound but they are different the first is aspirated and the second is  plain many languages treat these two phones differently see 
 nasal plosion – in english a plosive  has nasal plosion when it is followed by a nasal inside a word or across word boundary
 partial devoicing of  – in english sonorants  are partially devoiced when they follow a voiceless sound within the same syllable
 complete devoicing of sonorants – in english a sonorant is completely devoiced when it follows an aspirated plosive 
 partial devoicing of s – in english a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound inside a word or across its boundary
 retraction – in english  are retracted before 
because the choice of allophone is seldom under conscious control people may not realize they exist english speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme  namely unreleased  as in cat aspirated  as in top glottalized  as in button flapped  as in american english water nasalized flapped as in winter and none of the above  as in stop however they may become aware of the differences if for example they contrast the pronunciations of the following words
night rate unreleased  without  between  and 
nitrate  aspirated  or retracted 
if a flame is held before the lips while these words are spoken it flickers more during aspirated nitrate than during unaspirated night rate the difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips for a mandarin speaker to whom  and  are separate phonemes the english distinction is much more obvious than it is to the english speaker who has learned since childhood to ignore it
allophones of english  may be noticed if the light  of leaf  is contrasted with the dark  of feel  again this difference is much more obvious to a turkish speaker for whom  and  are separate phonemes than to an english speaker for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme
there are many examples for allophones in languages other than english typically languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation see eg  and   examples links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon

since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds not the sounds themselves they have no direct  when they are realized without much allophonic variation a simple  is used however when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme so that the allophony is significant things become more complicated often if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe in the sense of not requiring diacritics then that representation is chosen for the phoneme
however there may be several such allophones or the linguist may per greater precision than this allows in such cases a common convention is to use the elsewhere condition to decide which allophone will stand for the phoneme the elsewhere allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules for example english has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels the pattern is that vowels are nasal only when preceding a nasal consonant within the same syllable elsewhere theyre oral theore by the elsewhere convention the oral allophones are considered basic nasal vowels in english are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes
in other cases an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the worlds languages than the other allophones because it lects the historical origin of the phoneme or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory another alternative commonly employed for s is the use of a capital letter such as  n  for m n ŋ
in rare cases a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols such as s so as not to privilege any one allophone

affixes are divided into plenty of categories depending on their position with erence to the stem pix and suffix are extremely common terms infix and circumfix are less so as they are not important in european languages the other terms are uncommon

pix and suffix may be subsumed under the term adfix in contrast to infix
when marking text for ing as in the third column in the chart above simple affixes such as pixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens affixes which disrupt the stem or which themselves are discontinuous are often marked off with angle brackets reduplication is often shown with a tilde affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash
lexical affixes or semantic affixes are bound elements that appear as affixes but function as s within verbs and as elements of s in other words they are similar to word roots stems in function but similar to affixes in form although similar to incorporated nouns lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns ie they always appear as affixes
lexical affixes are relatively rare the   and  all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an  of the pacific northwest of the 
the lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of  written in the saanich orthography and in

lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning for instance one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense but it may not have any noun equivalent erring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning such saltwater whitewater etc in other cases the lexical suffixes have become  to various degrees
some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic  just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns gerdts 2003 gives examples of lexical suffixes in the  the  here is

as a  an allegory in its most general sense is an extended  allegory has been used widely throughout history in all forms of  largely because it can readily illustrate complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers readers or listeners
writers or speakers typically use allegories as s or as al devices that convey hidden meanings through ic figures actions imagery and or events which together create the moral spiritual or political meaning the author wishes to convey 
one of the best known examples of allegory s  forms a part of his larger work  in this allegory plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives facing a blank wall 514a b the people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows using language to identify their world 514c 515a according to the allegory the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows he tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves 516e 518a this allegory is on a basic level about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding seeks to share it as is his duty and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough

many ancient religions are based on  that is allegories of the movement of the sun and the moon as seen from the earth
in classical literature two of the best known allegories are  in platos  book vii and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of menenius agrippa  ii 32 in late antiquity  organized all the information a fifth century upper class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of mercury and philologia with the seven  the young man needed to know as guestscapella martianus william harris stahl richard johnson and e l burge the marriage of philology and mercury new york columbia up 1977 print

allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story while infusing it with a spiritual context medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a reality underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses the allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances thus the papal bull  1302 presents themes of the unity of  with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic theore of this one and only church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster if then the greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of peter and his successors they necessarily confess that they are not of the sheep of christ this text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the medieval period following the tradition and example of the bible

since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognized this is allegoresis or the act of reading a story as an allegory for instance many people have suggested that  is an allegory for the  although tolkien has dismissed this other examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of  and even some works of science fiction and fantasy such as  by  and  by 
it is important to note that while allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way according to henry littlefields 1964 article s   may be readily understood as a plot driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters intended to discuss the politics of the timelittlefield henry 1964 the wizard of oz parable on populism american quarterly 16 1 47–58 doi102307 2710826  yet  emphasized in 1893 that a fairy tale is not an allegory in direct erence to  name baum2000  s  is another example of a well known work sometimes perceived as allegorical yet as the author himself once stated i cordially dislike allegory in all of its manifestations and i have always done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presence name bogstadkaveny2011   while this does not mean his works may not be treated as having allegorical themes especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings this further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention

allotropy or allotropism  is the property of some s to exist in two or more different forms in the same physical state known as allotropes of these elements allotropes are different structural modifications of an element  the  of the element are  together in a different manner for example the  include  where the carbon atoms are bonded together in a  lattice arrangement  where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a   single sheets of graphite and s where the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical tubular or ellipsoidal formations the term allotropy is used for elements only not for  the more general term used for any crystalline material is  allotropy ers only to different forms of an element within the same  ie different   or  forms these different states are not themselves considered to be examples of allotropy
for some elements allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases – for example two   osub2 sub and  osub3 sub can both exist in the solid liquid and gaseous states conversely some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases – for example  has  which all revert to the same psub4 sub form when melted to the liquid state
the concepts of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the swedish scientist baron  1779–1848 name jensen  the term is derived from the   allotropia variability changeableness  after the acceptance of  in 1860 it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules and the two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as osub2 sub and osub3 sub name jensen  in the early 20th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure
by 1912  noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of  known for compounds and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism name jensen  although many other chemists have repeated this advice  and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements onlyjensen 2006 citing addison w e the allotropy of the elements elsevier 1964 that many have repeated this advice 
allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours  the change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures ie   and   theore the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions for instance   changes from a  structure  to a  structure  above 906ampnbsp°c and  undergoes a modification known as  from a lic form to a  form below 132ampnbsp°c 558ampnbsp°f as an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour ozone osub3 sub is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen osub2 sub
typically elements capable of variable  and or  tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms  another contributing factor is the ability of an element to

agathocles  agathoklḗs 361 – 289 bc was a   of  317–289 bc and king of  304–289 bc
agathocles was born at thermae eae modern name  in sicily the son of a  who had moved to syracuse in about 343 bc he learned his fathers trade but afterwards entered the army along with his brother  in 333 bc he married the  of his patron damas a distinguished and wealthy citizen he was twice  for attempting to overthrow the  party in syracuse
in 317 bc he returned with an army of  under a solemn oath to observe the   which was established after they took the city having banished or murdered some 10000 citizens and thus made himself master of syracuse he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of sicily
war with  followed in 311 bc agathocles was defeated in the  and  in syracuse in 310 bc he made a desperate effort to break through the  and attack the enemy in  in africa he concluded the treaty with  ruler of  after several victories he was at last completely defeated 307 bc and fled secretly to sicily
after concluding peace with carthage in 306 bc agathocles styled himself king of sicily in 304 bc and established his rule over the  cities of the island more firmly than ever a peace treaty with carthage left him in control of sicily east of the  even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on carthage at the time of his death
his last years were plagued by ill health and the turbulence of his grandson  at whose instigation he is said to have been ed according to others he died a natural death he was a born leader of mercenaries and although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular tyrant agathocles restored the syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king
agathocles was married three times his first wife was the widow of his patron damas by whom he had two sons  and agathocles who were both murdered in 307 bc his second wife was alcia and they had a daughter called  who married as the second wife of king  his third wife was the   who was the second daughter of  from her first husband  and was a stepdaughter of  theoxena bore agathocles two children  and  theoxena survived agathocles he had further descendants from his second and third marriage
agathocles was cited as an example of those who by their crimes come to be princes” in chapter viii of ’s treatise on politics  1513 
he was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career 
however he came to glory as much as he did brutality by repelling invading carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land however many later disapproved of his actions including to an extent machiavelli who claimed 
machiavelli goes on to reason that agathocles success in contrast to other criminal tyrants was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that

 albertas economy is the sum of all  in    although alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture forestry education tourism finance and manufacturing the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of  since the 1940s  revenue from oil and natural gas extraction has fueled a series of economic booms in the provinces recent history and s have included petrochemical and pipelines
albertas per capita gdp in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in canada at 74825 approx us75000 in 2006 albertas per capita gdp was  and  albertas per capita gdp in 2007 was 61% higher than the canadian average of 46441 and more than twice that of all the  in 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in canadian history 
according to the  alberta has very high levels of  and rates alberta as the most free economy in canada  and second most free economy amongst us states and canadian provinces 
each fiscal quarter the office of alberta treasury board and finance submits a report which includes an updated alberta economic outlook and predictions for the following year 
on august 30 2015  minister of finance of alberta released the quarterly fiscal update which covers the period from april 1 to june 30 stating that the alberta budget could include a deficit of as much as 65 billion canadian – 11 billion more than his previous estimate – if the oil industry downturn persists at recent levels name deficit  name recession  rachel notley’s ndp party came into power on may 24 2015 name recession   name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08  
factors such as the lower canadian us exchange rate and the lower  price differential bolstered the otherwise downgraded outlook the dramatic drop in the  weakened albertas economic outlook name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08   and continued to contribute to the provinces loss of revenue albertas oil and gas investment is expected to fall over 30% in 2015 with weakness carrying into 2016 name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08   from january through july oil rig activity declined almost 50% name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08   by july 2015 the unemployment rate was 60% name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08   in spite of the rising unemployment rate and the outflow of some albertans due to job loss 7723 people from outside alberta moved there from january to april leaving a positive net flow with a forecast population growth of 2% in 2015 name ab_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08  
alberta has a small internal market and it is relatively distant from major s despite good  and  alberta is located in the  of  in a region of low  called the  alberta is  and separated by  from the nearest  to the  and by the  from ports on  or  from these ports to major populations centres and markets in europe or asia is several thousands of kilometers the largest population clusters of north america the    and s are all thousands of kilometers away from alberta partly for this reason alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started  in other places notably the original  in great britain but which require large s and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets namely   or transportation related manufacturing   or 
 has the been a key industry since the 1870s the climate is dry  and  with extreme variations between seasons productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province excluding the mountains and in certain parts of the north agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in alberta than anywhere else in north america extending into the  above the  generally however  and areas along the  is forested land and  is more important than agriculture there agriculture is divided into primarily  in the east  in the west and a mixture in between and in the  in the near north
conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast oil sands are found in the northeast especially around  the 
because of its relatively economically isolated location alberta relies heavily on  with the rest of the world albertas historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new  see trends below alberta is now served by two major   and  by three major highway connections to the pacific the  via  the  via  and the  via  and one to the united states  as well as two international airports  and   also alberta is connected to the  natural gas to eastern canada the  gas  gas  and  oil to the eastern united states the  and  gas to the western united states and the  electric power to saskatchewan
since the days of early agricultural settlement the majority of albertas population has been concentrated in the  mixed forest grassland a boomerang shaped strip of land extending along the  from lloydminster to edmonton and then along the  south to calgary  this area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier  grassland region called  to its south and large areas of the south the “” were  during the  of the 1920s and 30s  the  black soil of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south  urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt  edmonton and red deer are parkland cities while calgary is on the parkland prairie fringe  lethbridge and medicine hat are prairie cities  grande prairie lies in the  a parkland region with isolated patches of prairie hence the name in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested    is the only urbanized population centre in the  which covers much of the northern half of the province
 
the calgary and edmonton regions by far the provinces two largest metropolitan regions account for the majority of the province’s population  they are relatively close to each other by the standards of western canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as vancouver or winnipeg  this has produced a history of political and economical rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities
the economic profile of the two regions is slightly different  both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands  however calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies  edmonton skews much more towards governments universities and hospitals as large employers while edmonton’s suburban fringes eg        are home to most of the province’s manufacturing much of it related to oil and gashttp  wwwedmontonjournalcom business lamphier+edmonton+roll+lucky 7691047 storyhtml 
seeing calgary and edmonton are part of a single economic region as the td study did in 2003 was novel the more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals for example in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the oil capital of canada
alberta has always been an  in line with   the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance in sequence the most important products have been fur wheat and beef and oil and gas
the development of  has been crucial to its historical economic development the  relied on   and  on  to move furs out of and european trade goods into the region immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the s  in 1880s commercial farming became viable in the area once the  had developed technologies to handle the  export of grain especially s and s oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing  technology
prior to the 1950s alberta was a primarily agricultural economy based on the export of   and a few other  the health of economy was closely bound up with the 
in 1947 a major  was discovered near edmonton it was not the first petroleum find in alberta but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province and coincided with growing american demand for energy since that time albertas economic fortunes have largely tracked the  and increasingly  when oil prices spiked during the   and  albertas economy boomed however during the  albertas economy suffered alberta boomed once again during the  in july 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and albertas economy soon followed suit with unemployment doubling within a year  by 2009 with natural gas prices at a long term low albertas economy was in poor health compared to before although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions  by 2012 despite natural gas prices at a ten year low and a higher canadian dollar oil prices had recovered enough to restart economic growth
the spin offs from petroleum have allowed alberta to develop many other industries oilpatch related manufacturing is an obvious example but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money
a comparison of the development of albertas less oil and gas endowed neighbours saskatchewan and manitoba reveals the role petroleum has played alberta was once the smallest of the three  by population in the early 20th century but by 2009 albertas population was 3632483 or approximately three times as much as either saskatchewan 1023810 or manitoba 1213815
albertas economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare government or retail primary industries are also of great importance however

 augustin louis cauchy    21 august 1789 – 23 may 1857 was a   reputed as a pioneer of  he was one of the first to state and prove theorems of  rigorously rejecting the heuristic principle of the  of earlier authors he almost singlehandedly founded  and the study of s in  a profound mathematician cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors his writings range widely in mathematics and 
more concepts and theorems have been named for cauchy than for any other mathematician in  alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for cauchy cauchy was a prolific writer he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks he was a devout  strict  royalist and a close associate of the 
cauchy was the son of  1760–1848 and marie madeleine desestre cauchy had two brothers alexandre laurent cauchy 1792–1857 who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849 and eugene françois cauchy 1802–1877 a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works
cauchy married aloise de bure in 1818  she was a close relative of the publisher who published most of cauchys works  by her he had two daughters marie françoise alicia 1819 and marie mathilde 1823
cauchys father  was a high official in the parisian police of the new régime he lost his position because of the  july 14 1789 that broke out one month before augustin louis was bornhis fathers dismissal is sometimes seen as the cause of the deep hatred of the french revolution that cauchy felt all through his life  the cauchy family survived the revolution and the following  1794 by escaping to arcueil where cauchy received his first education from his father after the execution of  1794 it was safe for the family to return to paris there louis françois cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job and quickly moved up the ranks when  came to power 1799 louis françois cauchy was further promoted and became secretary general of the senate working directly under  who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics the famous mathematician  was also a friend of the cauchy family
on lagranges advice augustin louis was enrolled in the  the best secondary school of paris at that time in the fall of 1802 most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages the young and ambitious cauchy being a brilliant student won many prizes in latin and humanities in spite of these successes augustin louis chose an engineering career and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the 
in 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam and he was admitted one of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high level scientific and mathematical education the school functioned under military discipline which caused the young and pious cauchy some problems in adapting nevertheless he finished the polytechnique in 1807 at the age of 18 and went on to the  school for bridges and roads he graduated in civil engineering with the highest honors
after finishing school in 1810 cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in cherbourg where napoleon intended to build a naval base here augustin louis stayed for three years and although he had an extremely busy managerial job he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts which he submitted to the première classe first class of the in the revolutionary years the french académie des sciences was known as the first class of the institut de france  cauchys first two manuscripts on  were accepted the third one on directrices of  was rejected
in september 1812 now 23 years old after becoming ill from overwork cauchy returned to paris another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics in paris he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position although he formally kept his engineering position he was transferred from the payroll of the ministry of the marine to the ministry of the interior the next three years augustin louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave and spent his time quite fruitfully working on mathematics on the related topics of  the  and the theory of higher order algebraic equations he attempted admission to the first class of the institut de france but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815 in 1815 napoleon was defeated at waterloo and the newly installed bourbon king  took the restoration in hand the  was re established in march 1816  and  were removed from this academy for political reasons and the king appointed cauchy to take the place of one of them the reaction by cauchys peers was harsh they considered his acceptance of membership of the academy an outrage and cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles
in november 1815  who was an associate professor at the École polytechnique asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star who certainly merited a professorship one of his great successes at that time was the proof of s  however the fact that cauchy was known to be very loyal to the bourbons doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of poinsot he finally quit his engineering job and received a one year contract for teaching mathematics to second year students of the École polytechnique in 1816 this bonapartist non religious school was reorganized and several liberal professors were fired the reactionary cauchy was promoted to full professor
when cauchy was 28 years old he was still living with his parents his father found it high time for his son to marry he found him a suitable bride aloïse de bure five years his junior the de bure family were printers and booksellers and published most of cauchys worksbradley amp sandifer page 9  aloïse and augustin were married on april 4 1818 with great roman catholic pomp and ceremony in the church of saint sulpice in 1819 the couples first daughter marie françoise alicia was born and in 1823 the second and last daughter marie mathilde
   cauchy had two brothers alexandre laurent cauchy who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849 and eugène françois cauchy a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works
the conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited cauchy perfectly in 1824 louis xviii died and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother  during these years cauchy was highly productive and published one important mathematical treatise after another he received cross appointments at the  and the 
in  charles x fled the country and was succeeded by the non bourbon king  of the  riots in which uniformed students of the École polytechnique took an active part raged close to cauchys home in paris
these events marked a turning point in cauchys life and a break in his mathematical productivity cauchy shaken by the fall of the government and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power left paris to go abroad leaving his family behind he spent a short time at  in switzerland where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime he used to do this and consequently lost all his positions in paris except his membership of the academy for which an oath was not required in 1831 cauchy went to the italian city of turin and after some time there he accepted an offer from the  who ruled turin and the surrounding piedmont region for a chair of theoretical physics which was created especially for him he taught in turin during 1832–1833 in 1831 he had been elected a foreign member of the 
in august 1833 cauchy left turin for  to become the science tutor of the thirteen year old duke of bordeaux  1820–1883 the exiled crown prince and grandson of charles x as a professor of the École polytechnique cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach and cramming his allotted time with too much material the young duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch although cauchy took his mission very seriously he did this with great clumsiness and with surprising lack of authority over the duke
during his civil engineering days cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the parisian sewers and he made the mistake of telling his pupil this with great malice the young duke went about saying that mister cauchy started his career in the sewers of paris his role as tutor lasted until the duke became eighteen years old in september 1838 cauchy did hardly any research during those five years while the duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics the only good that came out of this episode was cauchys promotion to  a title that cauchy set great store by in 1834 his wife and two daughters moved to prague and cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years of exile
cauchy returned to paris and his position at the academy of sciences late in 1838 he could not regain his teaching positions because he still used to swear an oath of allegiance however he desperately wanted to regain a formal position  in parisian science
in august 1839 a vacancy appeared in the  this bureau had some resemblance to the academy for instance it had the right to co opt its members further it was believed that members of the bureau could forget about the oath of allegiance although formally unlike the academicians they were obliged to take it the bureau des longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea – mainly the  coordinate since  is easily determined from the position of the sun since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations the bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences
in november 1839 cauchy was elected to the bureau and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with without his oath the king used to approve his election for four years cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected but not being approved hence he was not a formal member of the bureau did not receive payment could not participate in meetings and could not submit papers still cauchy used to take any oaths however he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to  in 1840 he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the academy he also described and illustrated the  of numbers an innovation presented in england in 1727 by  the confounded membership of the bureau lasted until the end of 1843 when cauchy was finally replaced by poinsot
throughout the nineteenth century the french educational system struggled over the separation of church and state after losing control of the public education system the catholic church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally he lent his prestige and knowledge to the  a school in paris run by jesuits for training teachers for their colleges he also took part in the founding of the  the purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of catholic university education in france these activities did not make cauchy popular with his colleagues who on the whole supported  ideals of the french revolution when a chair of mathematics became vacant at the  collège de france in 1843 cauchy applied for it but got just three out of 45 votes
the year 1848 was the year of revolution all over europe revolutions broke out in numerous countries beginning in france king louis philippe fearful of sharing the fate of louis xvi fled to england the oath of allegiance was abolished and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for cauchy on march 1 1849 he was reinstated at the faculté de sciences as a professor of mathematical astronomy after political turmoil all through 1848 france chose to become a republic under the presidency of  nephew of napoleon bonaparte and son of napoleons brother who had been installed as the first king of holland soon early 1852 the president made himself emperor of france and took the name 
not unexpectedly the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries including university professors not always does history repeat itself however because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the emperor to exempt cauchy from the oath cauchy remained a professor at the university until his death at the age of 67 he received the  and died at 4ampnbspam on may 23 1857

the genius of cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the —describing a  touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805 his generalization of  on  in 1811 and in several other elegant problems more important is his memoir on  propagation which obtained the grand prix of the french academy of sciences in 1816 cauchys writings covered notable topics including the theory of series where he developed the notion of  and discovered many of the basic formulas for  in the theory of numbers and complex quantities he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers he also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions the theory of functions differential equations and determinants
in the theory of light he worked on  wave theory and on the  and  of light    in  he developed the wave theory and his name is associated with the simple dispersion formula exactly which formula    he also contributed significant research in  substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter he wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media he introducedcauchy de la pression ou tension dans un corps solide on the pressure or tension in a solid body exercices de mathématiques vol 2 p 42 1827  a 3 × 3 symmetric  of numbers that is now known as the  in  he originated the theory of  and his results are nearly as valuable as those of 
other significant contributions include being the first to prove the 
cauchy is most famous for his single handed development of  the first pivotal theorem proved by cauchy now known as  was the following
math
 \oint_c fzdz   0
 math
where fz is a complex valued function  on and within the non self intersecting closed curve c contour lying in the  the contour integral is  taken along the contour c the rudiments of this theorem can  already be found in a paper that the 24 year old cauchy presented to the académie des sciences then still called first class of the institute on august 11 1814 in full formcauchy mémoire sur les intégrales définies prises entre des limites imaginaires memorandum on definite integrals taken between imaginary limits submitted to the académie des sciences on february 28 1825  the theorem was given in 1825 the 1825 paper is seen by many as cauchys most important contribution to mathematics
in 1826cauchy sur  un nouveau genre de calcul analogue au calcul infinitésimal on a new type of calculus analogous to the infinitesimal calculus exercices de mathématique vol 1 p 11 1826  cauchy gave a formal definition of a  of a function this concept regards functions that have s—isolated singularities ie points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity if the complex valued function fz can be expanded in the   of a singularity a as
math
fz   \phiz + \frac{b_1}{z a} + \frac{b_2}{z a^2} + \cdots + \frac{b_n}{z a^n}\quad
b_i za \in \mathbb{c}
 math
where φz is analytic ie well behaved without singularities then f is said to have  a pole of order n in the point a if n   1 the pole is called simple
the coefficient bsub1 sub is called by cauchy the residue of function f at a if f is non singular at a then the residue of f is zero at a clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to
math
\underset{z a}{\mathrm{res}} fz   \lim_{z \rightarrow a} z a fz
 math
where we replaced bsub1 sub by the modern notation of the residue
in 1831 while in turin cauchy submitted two papers to the academy of sciences of turin in the firstcauchy sur la mécanique céleste et sur un nouveau calcul qui sapplique à un grande nombre de questions diverses on the celestial mechanics and on a new calculus that can be applied to a great number of diverse questions presented to the academy of sciences of turin october 11 1831  he proposed the formula now known as 
math
fa   \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_c \frac{fz}{z a} dz
 math
where fz is analytic on c and within the region bounded by the contour c and the complex number a is somewhere in this region the contour integral is taken counter clockwise clearly the integrand has a simple pole at z   a in the second papercauchy mémoire sur les rapports qui existent entre le calcul des résidus et le calcul des limites et sur les avantages quoffrent ces deux calculs dans la résolution des équations algébriques ou transcendantes memorandum on the connections that exist between the residue calculus and the limit calculus and on the advantages that these two calculi offer in solving algebraic and transcendental equations presented to the academy of sciences of turin november 27 1831  he presented the 
math
 \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_c fz dz   \sum_{k 1}^n \underset{z a_k}{\mathrm{res}} fz
 math
where the sum is over all the n poles of fz on and within the contour c these results of cauchys still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers for quite some time contemporaries of cauchy ignored his theory believing it to be too complicated only in the 1840s the theory started to get response with  being the first mathematician besides cauchy making a substantial contribution his  published in 1843
 in his book cours danalyse cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis rigor in this case meant the rejection of the principle of  of earlier authors such as euler and lagrange and its replacement by geometry and s  judith grabiner wrote cauchy was the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of europe  the book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities and math\delta \epsilon math arguments were introduced into calculus  here cauchy defined continuity as follows the function fx is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if between these limits an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself
m barany claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against cauchys better judgement   gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to analyse algébrique was reduced in 1825 cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions and theore also infinitesimals at the beginning of the differential calculus laugwitz 1989 and benis sinaceur 1973 point out that cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853
cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero  there has been a vast body of literature written about cauchys notion of infinitesimally small quantities arguing they lead from everything from the usual epsilontic definitions or to the notions of    the consensus is that cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used 
he was the first to prove  rigorously establishing his well known form of the remainder he wrote a textbook name cauchy_1821https  booksgooglecom booksid urt0ksbdmdwcamppg pa11amplpg pa11   access date 2015 11 07   reissued by  2009 isbn 978 1 108 00208 0  see the illustration for his students at the École polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible in this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a  in the form that is still taught   which is epsilon delta    also cauchys well known test for  stems from this book  in 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbookcauchy leçons sur le calcul différentiel paris 1829  in spite of these cauchys own research papers often used intuitive not rigorous methodsmorris kline mathematics the loss of certainty isbn 0 19 503085 0 p 176  thus one of his theorems was exposed to a counter example by  later fixed by the introduction of the notion of

archimedes was born c 287ampnbspbc in the seaport city of  at that time a self governing  in  located along the coast of  the date of birth is based on a statement by the  historian  that archimedes lived for 75 years works of archimedes 1897  in  archimedes gives his fathers name as phidias an  about whom nothing is known  wrote in his  that archimedes was related to king  the ruler of syracuse  a biography of archimedes was written by his friend heracleides but this work has been lost leaving the details of his life obscure name mactutor  it is unknown for instance whether he ever married or had children during his youth archimedes may have studied in   where  and  were contemporaries he erred to conon of samos as his friend while two of his works  and the  have introductions addressed to eratosthenes
archimedes died c 212ampnbspbc during the  when roman forces under general  captured the city of syracuse after a two year long  according to the popular account given by  archimedes was contemplating a  when the city was captured a roman soldier commanded him to come and meet general marcellus but he declined saying that he had to finish working on the problem the soldier was enraged by this and killed archimedes with his sword plutarch also gives a  account of the death of archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a roman soldier according to this story archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items general marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of archimedes as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed name death  marcellus called archimedes a geometrical mary jaeger archimedes and the roman imagination p 113 
the last words attributed to archimedes are do not disturb my circles a erence to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the roman soldier this quote is often given in  as  but there is no reliable evidence that archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by plutarch  writing in memorable doings and sayings in the 1st century ad gives the phrase as sed protecto manibus puluere noli inquit obsecro istum disturbare    but protecting the dust with his hands said i beg of you do not disturb this the phrase is also given in  as μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε  name death 
the tomb of archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof consisting of a  and a  of the same height and diameter archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases in 75ampnbspbc 137 years after his death the roman   was serving as  in  he had heard stories about the tomb of archimedes but none of the locals was able to give him the location eventually he found the tomb near the agrigentine gate in syracuse in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription  a tomb discovered in the courtyard of the hotel panorama in syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of archimedes but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown 
the standard versions of the life of archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of ancient rome the account of the siege of syracuse given by  in his universal history was written around seventy years after archimedes death and was used subsequently as a source by plutarch and  it sheds little light on archimedes as a person and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city 
the most widely known  about archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape according to  a  for a temple had been made for king hiero ii who had supplied the pure  to be used and archimedes was asked to determine whether some  had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith  archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its 
while taking a bath he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in and realized that this effect could be used to determine the  of the crown for practical purposes water is incompressible  so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume by dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced the density of the crown could be obtained this density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added archimedes then took to the streets naked so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress crying  heúrēka meaning i have found it the test was conducted successfully proving that silver had indeed been mixed in 
the story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of archimedes moreover the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement name inaccuracy  archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in  as  which he describes in his treatise on floating bodies this principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a  equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces  using this principle it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold erence sample then immersing the apparatus in water the difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly  considered it probable that this method is the same that archimedes followed since besides being very accurate it is based on demonstrations found by archimedes himself name galileo  in a 12th century text titled mappae clavicula there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used and thus solve the problem name kingcrownhttp  wwwjstororg stable 27690606 o a w dilke gnomon 62 bd h 8 1990 pp 697 699 published by verlag chbeck marcel berthelot   sur l histoire de la balance hydrostatique et de quelques autres appareils et procédés scientifiques annales de chimie et de physique série 6 23   1891 pp 475 485  the latin poem carmen de ponderibus et mensuris of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown and attributes the method to archimedes name kingcrown  
a large part of archimedes work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of syracuse the greek writer  described how king hiero ii commissioned archimedes to design a huge ship the  which could be used for luxury travel carrying supplies and as a naval warship the syracusia is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity  according to athenaeus it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations a  and a temple dedicated to the goddess  among its facilities since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull the  was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water archimedes machine was a device with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder it was turned by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a  body of water into irrigation canals the archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain the archimedes screw described in roman times by  may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the     the worlds first seagoing  with a  was the  which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of archimedes and his work on the screw 
the  is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of syracuse also known as the ship shaker the claw consisted of a crane like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended when the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it there have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw and in 2005 a television documentary entitled superweapons of the ancient world built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device  
archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a  to burn ships attacking

this purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the renaissance  rejected it as false while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to archimedes  it has been suggested that a large array of highly polished  or  shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship this would have used the principle of the  in a manner similar to a 
a test of the archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the greek scientist ioannis sakkas the experiment took place at the  naval base outside  on this occasion 70 mirrors were used each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet 15 by 1ampnbspm the mirrors were pointed at a plywood  of a roman warship at a distance of around 160ampnbspfeet 50ampnbspm when the mirrors were focused accurately the ship burst into flames within a few seconds the plywood ship had a coating of  paint which may have aided combustion  a coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era
in october 2005 a group of students from the  carried out an experiment with 127 one foot 30ampnbspcm square mirror tiles focused on a  wooden ship at a range of around 100ampnbspfeet 30ampnbspm flames broke out on a patch of the ship but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes it was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions the mit group repeated the experiment for the television show  using a wooden fishing boat in  as the target again some charring occurred along with a small amount of flame in order to catch fire wood needs to reach its  which is around 300ampnbsp°c 570ampnbsp°f http  wwwengineeringtoolboxcom fuels ignition temperatures d_171html fuels and chemicalsampnbsp– auto ignition temperatures 
when mythbusters broadcast the result of the san francisco experiment in january 2006 the claim was placed in the category of busted or failed because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur it was also pointed out that since syracuse faces the sea towards the east the roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors mythbusters also pointed out that conventional weaponry such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances name death ray 
in december 2010 mythbusters again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled presidents challenge several experiments were carried out including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a  of a roman sailing ship 400ampnbspfeet 120ampnbspm away in all of the experiments the sail failed to reach the 210ampnbsp°c 410ampnbsp°f required to catch fire and the verdict was again busted the show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding  or distracting the crew of the ship name death ray2 
while archimedes did not invent the  he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work on the equilibrium of planes earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the  of the followers of  and are sometimes attributed to  name lever rorres  name lever clagett  according to  archimedes work on levers caused him to remark give me a place to stand on and i will move the earth quoted by  in synagoge book viii  plutarch describes how archimedes designed   systems allowing sailors to use the principle of age to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move  archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the  and with inventing the  during the  the odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled 
 106–43ampnbspbc mentions archimedes briefly in his   which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129ampnbspbc after the capture of syracuse c 212ampnbspbc general  is said to have taken back to rome two mechanisms constructed by archimedes and used as aids in astronomy which showed the motion of the sun moon and five planets cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by  and  the dialogue says that marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from syracuse and donated the other to the temple of virtue in rome marcellus mechanism was demonstrated according to cicero by  to  who described it thus
this is a description of a  or   stated that archimedes had written a manuscript now lost on the construction of these mechanisms entitled  modern research in this area has been focused on the  another device built ampnbspbc that was probably designed for the same purpose  constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of   this was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times but the discovery of the antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient greeks  
 
while he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics  wrote he placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no erence to the vulgar needs of life 
archimedes was able to use s in a way that is similar to modern  through proof by contradiction  he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy while specifying the limits within which the answer lay this technique is known as the  and he employed it to approximate the value of π in  he did this by drawing a larger  outside a  and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step as the number of sides increases it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle after four such steps when the polygons had 96 sides each he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3 approximately 31429 and 3 approximately 31408 consistent with its actual value of approximately 31416  he also proved that the  of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the  of the  of the circle πrsup2 sup in  archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude this is the  of real numbers 
in measurement of a circle archimedes gives the value of the  of 3 as lying between  approximately 17320261 and  approximately 17320512 the actual value is approximately 17320508 making this a very accurate estimate he introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it this aspect of the work of archimedes caused  to remark that he was as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his resultsquoted in heath t l works of archimedes dover publications isbn 0 486 42084 1  it is possible that he used an  procedure to calculate these values

in  archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain in doing so he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted he wrote there are some king gelo gelo ii son of  who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude and i mean by the sand not only that which exists about syracuse and the rest of sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited to solve the problem archimedes devised a system of counting based on the  the word is from the greek  murias for the number 10000 he proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads 100 million and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8  or 8

  two volumes
in the first part of this treatise archimedes spells out the law of  of fluids and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity this may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary greek astronomers such as  that the earth is round the fluids described by archimedes are not  since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape
in the second part he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids this was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships hulls some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water similar to the way that icebergs float  of buoyancy is given in the work stated as follows

prominent members of the science name  dawkins2003a  name  offit2013  and biomedical science community name angell1998  assert that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine that the expressions conventional medicine alternative medicine complementary medicine integrative medicine  and holistic medicine do not er to anything at all name angell1998  name  dawkins2003a  name  offit2013  name fontanarosa1998  their criticisms of trying to make such artificial definitions include theres no such thing as conventional or alternative or complementary or integrative or holistic medicine theres only medicine that works and medicine that doesnt name angell1998  name  dawkins2003a  name  offit2013  by definition alternative medicine has either not been proved to work or been proved not to work you know what they call alternative medicine thats been proved to work medicine name helmuth  there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work once a treatment has been tested rigorously it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset if it is found to be reasonably safe and effective it will be accepted name angell1998  and there is no alternative medicine there is only scientifically proven evidence based medicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine for which scientific evidence is lacking name fontanarosa1998 
others in both the biomedical and cam communities point out that cam cannot be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes and because the boundaries between cam and biomedicine overlap are porous and change the expression complementary and alternative medicine cam resists easy definition because the health systems and practices to which it ers are diffuse and its boundaries are poorly defined name  cam_sointu_nissen_eisenberg 
healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin theoretical basis   and in their relationship to the medical mainstream some alternative therapies including  and  have antique origins in east or south asia and are entirely alternative medical systemsbr    others such as homeopathy and chiropractic have origins in europe or the united states and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some such as  and chiropractic employ manipulative physical methods of treatment others such as  and  are based on s treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another name  nissen2013  thus chiropractic is not considered alternative in denmark and likewise  is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the united states name  nissen2013 
one common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as other than conventional medicine for example the widely erenced  descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the  of the  states that it is a group of diverse medical and health care systems practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine name nccih1  for conventional medical practitioners it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative
some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare name saks1992  this can er to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to  sympathetic coverage in the  or inclusion in the standard  name saks1992  in 1993 the  one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine stated that it erred to those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses name  bma_1993_1st  in a us context an influential definition coined in 1993 by the harvard based physician name  artus2007  david m eisenberg name  eisenberg_bio  characterized alternative medicine as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in us hospitalsbr    these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and cam introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training name  hol_kopelman_wieland_astin_pelletier  alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of  and increasingly  are willing to provide reimbursement for cam therapies in 1999 77% of us hospitals reported using some form of cam therapy this proportion had risen to 377% by 2008 name  salomonsen_aha 
an expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the us office for alternative medicine oam name  wieland2011  devised a  name  wieland2011  of alternative medicine as a broad domain of healing resourcesampnbsp other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period name  cam_rmc1997  this definition has been widely adopted by cam researchers name  wieland2011  cited by official government bodies such as the uk department of health name  ukdoh_cam  attributed as the definition used by the  name  zollchancoulrobeadamartu  and with some modification was perred in the 2005 consensus report of the  complementary and alternative medicine in the united states
the 1995 oam conference definition an expansion of eisenbergs 1993 formulation is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies name hufford2004  its proponents hold that it thus avoids  about differing forms of medical knowledge and while it is an essentially political definition this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream  is solely due to political forces name hufford2004   according to this definition alternative and  can only be differentiated with erence to what is intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture name kopelman2004  however there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and s nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity name kopelman2004  if the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population name kopelman2004 
 definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven unvalidated or ineffective and support of theories which have no recognized scientific basis these definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when used independently or in place of  they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine but which are not based on  gathered with the  name nccih1  name nsf_2002  name angell1998  name  nci_pdq_cam  name borkan2012  name kong2005  exemplifying this perspective a 1998 editorial co authored by  a former editor of the  argued that
 it is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work once a treatment has been tested rigorously it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset if it is found to be reasonably safe and effective it will be accepted but assertions speculation and testimonials do not substitute for evidence alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments name angell1998 
this line of division has been subject to criticism however as not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit  name ezzo2001  and it is also unlikely in most instances that conventional therapies if proven to be ineffective would ever be classified as cam name  wieland2011

much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent complete medical systems these were developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods each system was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre scientific western medicine or with each others systems examples are  and the  of 
other alternative medicine practices such as  were developed in western europe and in opposition to western medicine at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of  which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water but homeopathy with its remedies made of water was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time which included use of s and  often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death name chbhama 
other alternative practices such as  and  were developed in the united states at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories but the biomedical model was not yet totally dominant practices such as chiropractic and osteopathic each considered to be irregular practices by the western medical establishment also opposed each other both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing and licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field without the original nonscientific practices and theories osteopathic medicine is now considered the same as biomedicine

until the 1970s western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were erred to irregular practitioners and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific as practicing  name chbhama  irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as  and fraud as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments
dating from the 1970s medical professionals sociologists anthropologists and other commentators noted the increasing visibility of a wide variety of health practices that had neither derived directly from nor been verified by  name bivins2011  since that time those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field name bivins2011  a variety of terms have been used including heterodox irregular fringe and alternative medicine while others particularly medical commentators have been satisfied to label them as instances of quackery name bivins2011  the most persistent term has been alternative medicine but its use is problematic as it assumes a value laden dichotomy between a medical fringe implicitly of borderline acceptability at best and a privileged medical orthodoxy associated with validated medico scientific norms name jutte2001  the use of the category of alternative medicine has also been criticized as it cannot be studied as an independent entity but must be understood in terms of a regionally and temporally specific medical orthodoxy name  deblecourt1999  its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists name jutte1999  as with near synonymous expressions such as unorthodox complementary marginal or quackery these linguistic devices have served in the context of processes of professionalisation and market competition to establish the authority of official medicine and police the boundary between it and its unconventional rivals name jutte2001 
an early instance of the influence of this modern or western  scientific medicine outside europe and north america is  name  bullock1980 
from a historical perspective the emergence of alternative medicine if not the term itself is typically dated to the 19th century name  porter_ramsey_loudon  this is despite the fact that there are variants of western non conventional medicine that arose in the late eighteenth century or earlier and some non western medical traditions currently considered alternative in the west and elsewhere which boast extended historical pedigrees name jutte2001  alternative medical systems however can only be said to exist when there is an identifiable regularized and authoritative standard medical practice such as arose in the west during the nineteenth century to which they can function as an alternative
during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of europe and name  brunton_brown  as the nineteenth century progressed most western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semi protected medical markets name  pickstone2006  it is at this point that an official medicine created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of  emerges as a recognizable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable name  ramsey1999 
as part of this process professional adherents of mainstream medicine in countries such as germany france and britain increasingly invoked the scientific basis of their discipline as a means of engendering internal professional unity and of external differentiation in the face of sustained market competition from homeopaths naturopaths mesmerists and other nonconventional medical practitioners finally achieving a degree of imperfect dominance through alliance with the state and the passage of regulatory legislation name jutte2001  name jutte1999  in the us the  based in baltimore maryland opened in 1893with  and  among the founding physicians and was the first medical school devoted to teaching german scientific medicine name  silverman2011 
buttressed by the increased authority arising from significant advances in the medical sciences of the late 19th century onwards—including the development and application of the  by the chemist  and the surgeon  of  co founded by  in 1885 appointed professor of  at the  and of the use of s s—the 1910  called upon  to follow the model set by the johns hopkins school of medicine and adhere to mainstream science in their teaching and research this was in a belief mentioned in the reports introduction that the preliminary and professional training then prevailing in medical schools should be ormed in view of the new means for diagnosing and combating disease being made available to physicians and surgeons by the sciences on which medicine depended name  hiatt2003 
among putative medical practices available at the time which later became known as alternative medicine were homeopathy founded in germany in the early 19c and chiropractic founded in north america in the late 19c these conflicted in principle with the developments in medical science upon which the flexner orms were based and they have not become compatible with further advances of medical science such as listed in  1900–1999 and 2000–present nor have ayurveda acupuncture or other kinds of alternative medicine
at the same time  was being developed as a specialist branch of western medicine in research establishments such as  founded in 1898 by   founded in 1899 by  and  instituted in 1912 a distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems an example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in india including ayurveda submitted by  and others in 1923 this stated that the first question the committee considered was to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not name  usman1925  name  madras1984 
by the later twentieth century the term alternative medicine entered public discourse name  bma_cant_saks  but it was not always being used with the same meaning by all parties  remarked in 1998 that in the best kind of medical practice all proposed treatments must be tested objectively and that in the end there will only be treatments that pass and those that do not those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not he asked can there be any reasonable alternative name  relman1998  but also in 1998 the then   name  historymakers_hhs_satcher_bio  issued public information about eight common alternative treatments including acupuncture holistic and massage together with information about common diseases and conditions on nutrition diet and lifestyle changes and about helping consumers to decipher fraud and quackery and to find healthcare centers and doctors who practiced alternative medicine name  new_millennium 
by 1990 approximately 60 million americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues according to a nationwide survey in the us published in 1993 by david eisenberg name  eisenberg1993  a study published in the november 11 1998 issue of the  reported that 42% of americans had used complementary and alternative therapies up from 34% in 1990 name  eisenberg1998  however despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine most of the early alternative complementary medical centers failed name  bravewell2007

the british medical association in its publication complementary medicine new approach to good practice 1993 gave as a working definition of non conventional therapies including acupuncture chiropractic and homeopathy those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the orthodox health care professions and the skills of which are not part of the undergraduate curriculum of orthodox medical and paramedical health care courses by 2000 some medical schools in the uk were offering cam familiarisation courses to undergraduate medical students while some were also offering modules specifically on cam name  walton_science_and_technology_committee 
 
the  complementary medicine field explains its scope and topics by giving a broad and general definition for complementary medicine as including practices and ideas which are outside the domain of conventional medicine in several countries and defined by its users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well being and which complement mainstream medicine in three ways by contributing to a common whole by satisfying a demand not met by conventional practices and by diversifying the conceptual framework of medicine name  cochrane_cam_field

criticisms have come from individuals such as wallace sampson in an article in annals of the new york academy of sciences june 1995 name atramm   sampson argued that proponents of alternative medicine often used terminology which was loose or ambiguous to create the appearance that a choice between alternative effective treatments existed when it did not or that there was effectiveness or scientific validity when it did not exist or to suggest that a dichotomy existed when it did not or to suggest that consistency with science existed when it might not that the term alternative was to suggest that a patient had a choice between effective treatments when there was not that use of the word conventional or mainstream was to suggest that the difference between alternative medicine and science based medicine was the prevalence of use rather than lack of a scientific basis of alternative medicine as compared to conventional or mainstream science based medicine that use of the term complementary or integrative was to suggest that purported supernatural energies of alternative medicine could complement or be integrated into science based medicine integrative medicine or integrated medicine is used to er to the belief that medicine based on science would be improved by integration with alternative medical treatments practices that are not and is substantially similar in use to the term complementary and alternative medicine name bmj_may

alternative therapies lack the requisite  and their  is either  or  name atramm   name nsf_2002  name kent1997  name  goldrosen2004   many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed  misleading results from only publishing positive results and not all results marked differences in product quality and standardisation and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where herbs may have some evidence of containing chemicals that may affect health name sarris2012  the scientific review of alternative medicine points to confusions in the general population    a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise ineffective therapy just because they are taking something the placebo effect the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness the  gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken a person not diagnosed with science based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category name  alcock1999

cancer researcher  has stated
 contrary to much popular and scientific writing many  have been investigated in good quality clinical trials and they have been shown to be ineffective in this article clinical trial data on a number of alternative cancer cures including livingston wheeler di bella multitherapy antineoplastons vitamin c hydrazine sulfate  and psychotherapy are reviewed the label unproven is inappropriate for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven name vickers 
homeopathy is based on the belief that a disease can be cured by a very low dose of substance that creates similar symptoms in a healthy person name  stratten_in_hahnemann  this conflicts with fundamental concepts of physics and chemistry and there is no good evidence from reviews of research to support its use name ernst2002  name nccih_homeopathy  name  hoc_evidence_check2_homeopathy  name shang2005 
some commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of  in alternative medicine  has said  that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of unidirectional bias because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject name unid  ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100% of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in china had positive conclusions name unid   contrasts  in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudoscience based research of striving to confirm pre existing notions name gorski   writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists in the case of acupuncture for example an acupuncturist would have a great deal to lose if acupuncture were rejected by research but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials name hall 
many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects which can be fatal 
one of the commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine cam is the manner in which is regulated there have been significant developments in how cams should be assessed prior to re sale in the united kingdom and the european union eu in the last 2 years despite this it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws name  colquhoun2012   there is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection from false claims toxicity and advertising with freedom to choose remedies
advocates of cam suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect name  connelly2012  some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over the counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose such as paracetamol name  malcolm2012 
 
forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine examples include immuno augmentation therapy shark cartilage bioresonance therapy oxygen and ozone therapies insulin potentiation therapy some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs radiation therapy or anesthetics during surgery among other problems name cassilethdeng2004  an anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by associate professor alastair maclennan of adelaide university australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking natural potions to build up her strength before the operation including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death name hills1999 
to abc online maclennan also gives another possible mechanism
and lastly  theres the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off and theyre disappointed and they move on to the next one and theyre disappointed and disillusioned and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult because you may not get compliance because theyve seen the failure so often in the past name  swanabc 
 
conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired  whereas alternative treatments in general are not subjected to such testing at all any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side effects attempts to ute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the  fallacy ie that which is natural cannot be harmful specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies  
an exception to the normal thinking regarding side effects is  since 1938 the  fda has regulated homeopathic products in several significantly different ways from other drugs name stehlin  homeopathic preparations termed remedies are extremely dilute often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active and possibly toxic ingredient is likely to remain they are thus considered safe on that count but their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs name stehlin 
 
those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious possibly life threatening illness name  navarro2006  for this reason critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous according to mental health journalist scott lilienfeld in 2002 unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments and ers to this as  individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful in short even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes name lilienfeld2002 
between 2001 and 2003 four children died in australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic homeopathic or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies name  hughes2010 
 
there have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in  these alternative cancer cures have often been described as unproven suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown however many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good quality clinical trials and they have been shown to be ineffectivethe label unproven is inappropriate for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven name vickers 
 has stated
  any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition there will never be an alternative cancer cure why because if something looked halfway promising then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it and if there is anything to it it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly all curative alternative cancer cures are based on false claims are bogus and i would say even criminal name miller 
funding for research into effectiveness of alternative treatments comes from a variety of public and private sources in the usa one conduit for funding and information is the national center for complementary and integrative medicine nccih other governments have various levels of funding the dutch government funded cam research between 1986 and 2003 but formally ended it in 2006 name  renkens2009 
physicians who practice complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available complementary therapies patients often express interest in mind body complementary therapies because they offer a non drug approach to treating some health conditions name  sobel2000  some mind body techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy were once considered complementary medicine but are now a part of conventional medicine in the united states name  webmd2011 
against alternative medicine it has been argued that in addition to the social cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth one of the most critical is the placebo effect which is a well established observation in medicine name  van_deventer2008   related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe name beyerstein   es that help maintain self esteem and promote harmonious social functioning name beyerstein   and the  fallacy name beyerstein  
cams popularity may be related to other factors which  mentioned in an interview in 
blockquotewhy is it so popular then ernst blames the providers customers and the doctors whose neglect he says has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped people are told lies there are 40 million websites and 399 million tell lies sometimes outrageous lies they mislead cancer patients who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives at the same time people are gullible it needs gullibility for the industry to succeed it doesnt make me popular with the public but its the truth name con  blockquote

blockquotecam is popular an analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor providers of cam tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals in turn this implies that much of the popularity of cam is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare we should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients name  ernst2010  blockquote
a study published in 1998 indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments name astin1998  approximately 44 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine the research found that those having used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was not a meaningful factor in the choice but rather the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so largely because they find these healthcare alternatives to be more congruent with their own values beliefs and philosophical orientations toward health and life in particular subjects reported a holistic orientation to health a transformational experience that changed their worldview identification with a number of groups committed to environmentalism feminism psychology and or spirituality and personal growth or that they were suffering from a variety of common and minor ailments – notable ones being anxiety back problems and chronic pain
authors have speculated on the socio cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them in lieu of conventional medicine there are several socio cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of  among the public at large and a concomitant increase in  attitudes and   name beyerstein   related to this are vigorous  name  weber  of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics name beyerstein2001  name beyerstein 
there is also an increase in  toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies mistrust of traditional authority figures such as the physician and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments name beyerstein2001  many patients lack access to contemporary medicine due to a lack of private or public  which leads them to seek out lower cost alternative medicine name  barnes2004  medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market name weber 
patients can also be averse to the painful unpleasant and sometimes dangerous  of biomedical treatments treatments for severe diseases such as  and  infection have well known significant side effects even low risk medications such as  can have potential to cause life threatening  reactions in a very few individuals also many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach in all of these cases patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments name beyerstein2001  name beyerstein 
schofield and others in a systematic review published in 2011 make ten recommendations which they think may increase the effectiveness of consultations in a conventional here oncology setting such as ask questions about cam use at critical points in the illness trajectory respond to the persons emotional state and provide balanced evidence based advice they suggest that this approach may address  concerns surrounding cam use and encourage informed decision making about cam and ultimately improve outcomes for patients name  schofield2010

in  an archimedean solid is a highly symmetric semi regular  composed of two or more types of s meeting in identical  they are distinct from the s which are composed of only one type of polygon meeting in identical vertices and from the s whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices
identical vertices are usually taken to mean that for any two vertices there must be an  of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other sometimes it is instead only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other this difference in definitions controls whether the  pseudo rhombicuboctahedron is considered an archimedean solid or a  it is the unique convex polyhedron that has regular polygons meeting in the same way at each vertex but that does not have a global symmetry taking every vertex to every other vertex based on its existence  has suggested a terminological distinction in which an archimedean solid is defined as having the same vertex figure at each vertex including the elongated square gyrobicupola while a  is defined as having each vertex symmetric to each other vertex excluding the 
 and s whose s are the s are generally not considered to be archimedean solids despite meeting the above definition with this restriction there are only finitely many archimedean solids all but the elongated square gyrobicupola can be made via s from the platonic solids with   and 
the archimedean solids take their name from  who discussed them in a now lost work  ers to it stating that archimedes listed 13 polyhedra name g09  during the  s and s valued pure forms and rediscovered all of these forms this search was almost entirely completed around 1620 by field j rediscovering the archimedean polyhedra piero della francesca luca pacioli leonardo da vinci albrecht dürer daniele barbaro and johannes kepler archive for history of exact sciences 50 1997 227  who defined   and the non convex solids known as the 
kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola pseudorhombicuboctahedron at least he once stated that there were 14 archimedean solids however his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedrons existence was made in 1905 by  name g09 
there are 13 archimedean solids not counting the  15 if the s of two  see below are counted separately
here the vertex configuration ers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex for example a  of 468 means that a   and  meet at a vertex with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex

some definitions of  include one more figure the  or pseudo rhombicuboctahedron pampnbsp85 
the number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex 
the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are  and are called 
the  of the archimedean solids are called the s  together with the s and  these are the  solids with regular vertices
the snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as  as they come in a left handed latin levomorph or laevomorph form and right handed latin dextromorph form when something comes in multiple forms which are each others three dimensional  these forms may be called enantiomorphs  this nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain s
the different archimedean and platonic solids can be related to each other using a handful of general constructions  starting with a platonic solid  involves cutting away of corners  to preserve symmetry the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners  depending on how much is truncated see table below different platonic and archimedean and other solids can be created  or  involves moving each face away from the center by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the platonic solid and taking the convex hull  expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces thus breaking the rectangles corresponding to edges into triangles  the last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges  ignoring scaling expansion can also be viewed as truncation of corners and edges but with a particular ratio between corner and edge truncation

note the duality between the cube and the octahedron and between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron  also in part due to self duality of the tetrahedron only one archimedean solid has only tetrahedral symmetry

in  an n sided antiprism is a  composed of two parallel copies of some particular n sided  connected by an alternating band of s antiprisms are a subclass of the s
antiprisms are similar to s except the bases are twisted relative to each other and that the side faces are triangles rather than quadrilaterals
in the case of a regular n sided base one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180° n extra regularity is obtained by the line connecting the base centers being perpendicular to the base planes making it a right antiprism as faces it has the two  bases and connecting those bases 2n isosceles triangles
a  antiprism has apart from the base faces 2n equilateral triangles as faces as a class the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex uniform polyhedra as do the uniform prisms for  we have as degenerate case the regular  as a digonal antiprism and for  the non degenerate regular  as a triangular antiprism

uniform star antiprisms are named by their  bases {p q} and exist in prograde and retrograde crossed solutions crossed forms have intersecting s and are denoted by inverted fractions p p q instead of p q like 5 3 versus 5 2
in the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry
some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths so are not uniform polyhedra star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where p and q have common factors thus a 10 4 antiprism is the compound of two 5 2 star antiprisms

the natural history of africa encompasses some of the well known  of that 
 is the study and description of organisms and natural objects especially their origins evolution and interrelationships
the vegetation of  follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture the northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally which is tropical in the countries bordering the  there are groves of  and  trees evergreen s  trees and s intermixed with    and fragrant 
south of the  range the conditions alter  the zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness  characteristic of the  is the  which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence while in the semidesert regions the  from which gum arabic is obtained is abundant
the more humid regions have a richer vegetation dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts and in the west african equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper  and  interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias etc forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation in the coast regions the typical tree is the  which flourishes wherever the soil is of a  character
the dense s of west africa contain in addition to a great variety of s two   oil palm and  bamboo palm not found generally speaking in the savanna regions  or silk cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests which are the home of the india rubber producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees such as  chlorophora excelsa   khaya senegalensis  oldfieldia africana and  baphia nitida the climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or bush is extremely dense
in the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or  adanisonia digitata  hyphaene and s the  plant grows wild in such widely separated places as  and southern  the higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern  the  and 
in the swamp regions of north east africa  and associated plants including the soft wooded  flourish in immense quantities and little else is found in the way of vegetation south africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions tropical flora disappears and in the semi desert plains the fleshy leafless contorted species of s s s and other succulent plants make their appearance there are too valuable timber trees such as the  podocarpus elongatus  ocotea  or  pteroxylon utile and ironwood extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent of the grasses of africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the atlas range
the fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation  the open savannas are the home of large s especially s the  peculiar to africa   wild  and four species of  and of carnivores such as the    etc the  a genus restricted to africa is found only in the dense forests of the  basin s are confined to the atlas region  and es to north africa the  though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters is found both in the savannas and forest regions the latter being otherwise poor in large game though the special habitat of the  and  s and s with few exceptions are peculiar to africa the single humped  as a domestic animal is

the average elevation of the continent approximates closely to  above sea level roughly near to the mean elevation of both  and  but considerably less than that of   in contrast with other continents it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground lands under  occupying an unusually small part of the surface while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of asia or south america but the area of land over  is also quite insignificant being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges so prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term inselberg landschaft island mountain landscape has been adopted in  to describe this kind of country thought to be in great part the result of wind action

the high southern and eastern plateaus rarely falling below  have a mean elevation of about  the  as far as about 12° s is bounded east west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts on this account south africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them the largest of these level areas the  is a dry barren region and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the 
the south african plateau is connected towards  with probably a slightly greater average elevation and marked by some distinct features it is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges tablelands and depressions the most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the earths crust the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley occupied by  the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system
farther north the western depression known as the  is occupied for more than half its length by water forming the  of    and  the first named over  long and the longest freshwater lake in the world associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks the greatest of which occur on a  east of the eastern trough the eastern branch of the  contains much smaller lakes many of them  and without outlet the only one comparable to those of the western trough being  or basso norok
at no great distance east of this rift valley is    with its two peaks kibo and mawenzi the latter being  and the culminating point of the whole continentampnbsp— and  which is  hardly less important is the  over  which lies east of the western trough other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys some of the kirunga mfumbiro group north of lake kivu being still partially active this could cause most of the citys and states to be flooded with lava and ash
the third division of the higher region of africa is formed by the  a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent little of its surface falling below  while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m this block of country lies just west of the line of the great east african trough the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the red sea there is however in the centre a circular basin occupied by 
both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast the ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the red sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of  in the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower the most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the  adamawa etc where heights of  are reached exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the cameroon on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south west has a height of  while clarence peak in  the first of the line of islands rises to over  towards the extreme west the futa jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers but beyond this as far as the atlas chain the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting
the area between the east and west coast highlands which north of 17° n is mainly desert is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground one of which runs nearly centrally through north africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole the best marked of the basins so formed the  basin occupies a circular area bisected by the equator once probably the site of an inland sea
running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the 
the arid region the ampnbsp— the largest desert in the world covering ampnbsp— extends from the  to the red sea though generally of slight elevation it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to  bordered nw by the atlas range to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the  this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the nile that river see below pierces the desert without modifying its character the  the north westerly part of the continent between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places  broad from the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the sahara the greater part of that now desert region is indeed furrowed by old water channels

from the outer margin of the african plateaus a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands before breaking through the outer ranges the main drainage of the continent is to the north and west or towards the basin of the 
to the main african rivers belong nile the longest river of africa congo river with the highest water discharge on the continent and the niger which flows half of its length through the arid areas the largest lakes are the following lake victoria lake ukerewe lake chad in the centre of the continent lake tanganika lying between the democratic republic of congo burundi tanzania and zambia there is also the considerably large lake malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world  malawi there are also numerous water dams throughout the continent kariba on the river of zambezi asuan in egypt on the river of nile and the biggest dam of the continent lying completely in the republic of ghana is called akosombo on the volta river fobil 2003
the high lake plateau of the  region contains the headwaters of both the nile and the 
the upper nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the central african trough in the neighbourhood of the equator from there streams pour eastward into  the largest lake in africa covering over 26000 square m and to the west and north into  and  to the latter of these the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters issuing from there the nile flows northward and between the latitudes of 7 and 10 degrees north it traverses a vast marshy level where its course is liable to being blocked by floating vegetation after receiving the bahr el ghazal from the west and the   and  from the  the chief gathering ground of the flood water it separates the great desert with its fertile watershed and enters the mediterranean at a vast delta
the most remote head stream of the congo is the  which flows southwest into the marshy  from this lake issues the congo known in its upper course by various names flowing first south it afterwards turns north through  and descends to the forest clad basin of west equatorial africa traversing this in a majestic northward curve and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the atlantic ocean through the western highlands
north of the congo basin and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface is the basin of  – a flat shored shallow lake filled principally by the  coming from the southeast
west of this is the basin of the  the third major river of africa with its principal source in the far west it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the nile and congo and ultimately flows into the atlanticampnbsp— a fact that eluded european geographers for many centuries an important branch howeverampnbsp— the —flows from the southeast
these four river basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of north and west africaampnbsp— the remainder consists of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea
of the remaining rivers of the atlantic basin the  in the extreme south brings the drainage from the  on the opposite side of the continent while the kunene kwanza ogowe and sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb the  komoe bandama  and  the highlands of the western limb north of the senegal for over  of coast the arid region reaches to the atlantic farther north are the streams with comparatively short courses reaching the atlantic and mediterranean from the atlas mountains
of the rivers flowing to the  the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the  whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands the main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ s 24°22′ e at an elevation of  it flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward all the largest tributaries including the shire the outflow of  flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10° to 12° s in the southwest the zambezi system interlaces with that of the  or tioghe from which it at times receives surplus water the rest of the water of the taukhe known in its middle course as the  is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in  now dried up
farther south the  drains a portion of the interior plateau but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source the   and  principally drain the outer slopes of the african great lakes highlands
in the  region to the north the  and the  rivers begin in the  these rivers mainly flow southwards with the jubba emptying in the  the shebelle river reaches a point to the southwest after that it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the jubba river another large stream the  rising in the ethiopian mountains is lost in a saline depression near the gulf of aden
between the basins of the atlantic and indian oceans there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the ethiopian plateau directed chiefly into the lakes in the  the largest river is the  which fed by the rains of the ethiopian highlands carries down a large body of water into  the rivers of africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths or by cataracts at no great distance upstream but when these obstacles have been overcome the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters
the area of the congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the amazon while the african inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but asia where the corresponding area is 4000000 square miles 10 mm²
the principal lakes of africa are situated in the african great lakes plateau as a rule the lakes found within the great rift valley have steep sides and are very deep this is the case with the two largest of the type tanganyika and nyasa the latter with depths of 430 s 790 m
others however are shallow and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season such are  in a subsidiary depression north of nyasa and eiassi and manyara in the system of the great rift valley lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth the deepest sounding in  being under 50 fathoms 90 m
besides the african great lakes the principal lakes on the continent are  in the northern inland watershed  and  traversed by the head stream of the congo and  and ntomba mantumba within the great bend of that river all except possibly mweru are more or less shallow and lake chad appears to be drying up
divergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the african great lakes especially  which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea dating from a time when the whole central congo basin was under water others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence the former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type they include jellyfish molluscs prawns crabs etc

lying almost entirely within the tropics and equally to north and south of the equator africa does not show excessive variations of temperature name  africa geography 
great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of north africa removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean and here too the contrast between day and night and between summer and winter is greatest the rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point
farther south the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface especially in east africa where the range of temperature is wider than in the congo basin or on the guinea coast
in the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone the south of the continent being narrower than the north the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt
the most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall the wide heated plains of the sahara and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the kalahari in the south have an exceedingly scanty rainfall the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation in the inter tropical zone of summer precipitation the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after it is theore greatest of all near the equator where the sun is twice vertical and less in the direction of both tropics
the rainfall zones are however somewhat deflected from a due west to east direction the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast and those of the south northwards along the west within the equatorial zone certain areas especially on the shores of the gulf of guinea and in the upper nile basin have an intensified rainfall but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world the rainiest district in all africa is a strip of coastland west of  where there is a mean annual rainfall of about  as compared with a mean of  at  in  
the two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone where the sun is vertical at half yearly intervals become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics where the sun is overhead but once snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges and on the highest the climate is thoroughly alpine
the countries bordering the sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind full of fine particles of sand blowing from the desert towards the sea known in  as the  on the mediterranean as the  it is called on the guinea coast the  this wind is not invariably hot its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result similar dry winds blow from the  in the south on the eastern coast the monsoons of the indian ocean are regularly felt and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced
the climate of africa lends itself to certain environmental diseases the most serious of which are   and  malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in africa it is transmitted by a genus of mosquito  native to africa and can be contracted over and over again there is not yet a vaccine for malaria which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in africa recently the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria
yellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to africa unlike malaria it cannot be contracted more than once like chicken pox it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease name  africa geography 
sleeping sickness or african trypanosomiasis is a disease that usually affects animals but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well it is transmitted by the  and is found almost exclusively in sub saharan africa  this disease has had a significant impact on african development not because of its deadly nature like malaria but because it has prevented africans from pursuing agriculture as the sleeping sickness would kill their livestock name  africa geography

approval voting is a  used for s each voter may approve of ie select any number of candidates the winner is the most approved candidate
guy ottewell first described the system in 1977  and also by  who coined the term approval voting it was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist  and mathematician   the idea of approval was adopted by x hu and  in 2003   in studying  in organizations
approval voting can be considered a form of  with the range restricted to two values 0 and 1—or a form of  with grades restricted to good and poor approval voting can also be compared to  without the rule that discards ballots that vote for more than one candidate
by treating each candidate as a separate question do you approve of this person for the job approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one some or all candidates all votes count equally and everyone gets the same number of votes one vote per candidate either for or against final tallies show how many voters support each candidate and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support
approval voting ballots show for each office being contested a list of the candidates running for that seat next to each name is a checkbox or another similar way to mark yes or no for that candidate this check yes or no approach means approval voting provides one of the simplest ballots for a voter to understand
ballots on which the voter marked every candidate the same whether yes or no have no effect on the outcome of the election each ballot can theore be viewed as a small  that separates two groups of candidates those supported and those that are not each candidate approved is considered perred to any candidate not approved while the voters perences among approved candidates is unspecified and likewise the voters perences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified
approval voting has been adopted by the  1986  the   the institute of management sciences 1987 now the http  wwwinformsorg downloadfilephpi a1d0c6e83f027327d8461063f4ac58a6 informs bylaws p 7  the  1987  and the  1987  according to steven j brams and peter c fishburn the ieee board in 2002 rescinded its decision to use approval voting ieee executive director daniel j senese stated that approval voting was abandoned because few of our members were using it and it was felt that it was no longer needed

span id historical_usehistorically several voting methods that incorporate aspects of approval voting have been used span

 in the 13th through 18th centuries the  elected the  using a multi stage process that featured random selection and voting that allowed approval of multiple candidates and required a supermajority miranda mowbray dieter gollmann 2007

 the selection of the  of the  has involved rounds of approval polling to help discover and build a consensus before a formal vote is held in the security council
 
approval voting advocates  and  predict that approval voting should increase voter participation prevent minor party candidates from being spoilers and reduce negative campaigningbrams and herschbach   the effect of this system as an  measure is not without critics however  has a position paper arguing that approval voting has three flaws that undercut it as a method of voting and political vehiclehttp  archivefairvoteorg indexphppage 1920 why irv  they argue that it can result in the defeat of a candidate who would win an absolute majority in a plurality system can allow a candidate to win who might not win any support in a plurality elections and has incentives for

a generalized version of the burr dilemma applies to approval voting when two candidates are appealing to the same subset of voters  although approval voting differs from the voting system used in the burr dilemma approval voting can still leave candidates and voters with the generalized dilemma of whether to compete or cooperatenagel j h 2007 the burr dilemma in approval voting the journal of politics 691 43 58 http  wwwjournalofpoliticsorg files 69_1 nagelpdf nagel jh 2006 http  dxdoiorg 101007 3 540 35605 3_10 a strategic problem in approval voting mathematics and democracy pp 133 150 studies in choice and welfare series springer 
while in the modern era there have been relatively few competitive approval voting elections where tactical voting is more likely brams argues that approval voting usually elects  in practicesteven j brams mathematics and democracy princeton university press 2008 p 16 see also http  wwwnyuedu gsas dept politics faculty brams theory_to_practicepdf s brams and p fishburn going from theory to practice the mixed success of approval voting   critics of the use of approval voting in the alumni elections for the dartmouth board of trustees in 2009 placed its ultimately successful repeal before alumni voters arguing that the system has not been electing the most centrist candidates the dartmouth editorialized that when the alumni electorate fails to take advantage of the approval voting process the three required alumni council candidates tend to split the majority vote giving petition candidates an advantage by reducing the number of alumni council candidates and instituting a more traditional one person one vote system trustee elections will become more democratic and will more accurately lect the desires of our alumni base 
approval voting is vulnerable to  and   while it is immune to  and 
 occurs when a voter approves only candidate a instead of both a and b for the reason that voting for b can cause a to lose
 occurs when a voter approves an additional candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning
strategic approval voting differs from ranked choice voting methods where voters might reverse the perence order of two options strategic approval voting with more than two options involves the voter changing their approval threshold the voter decides which options to give the same rating despite having a strict perence order between them
approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those  that directly lect the true perences of a voter ie that do not report perences falsely name sinceredefbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 29   they also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voters  as being any vote that if it votes for one candidate it also votes for any more perred candidate  this definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly perred candidates the same ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote the definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally perred candidates differently  when there are two or more candidates every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from  two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates  when there are three or more candidates every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates
 
based on the definition above if there are four candidates a b c and d and a voter has a strict perence order perring a to b to c to d then the following are the voters possible sincere approval votes
vote for a b c and d
vote for a b and c
vote for a and b
vote for a
vote for no candidates
if the voter instead equally pers b and c while a is still the most perred candidate and d is the least perred candidate then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote
vote for a and c
the decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary approval cutoff all candidates perred to the cutoff are approved all candidates less perred are not approved and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily
a sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use  is a way to make that choice in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting rather than being an alternative to it name probstrat  this differs from other voting systems that typically have a unique sincere vote for a voter
when there are three or more candidates the winner of an approval voting election can change depending on which sincere votes are used in some cases approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates including a  and a  without the voter perences changing  to the extent that electing a condorcet winner and not electing a condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere strategic voting   in one sense conditions where this can happen are robust and are not isolated cases   on the other hand the variety of possible outcomes has also been portrayed as a virtue of approval voting representing the flexibility and responsiveness of approval voting not just to voter ordinal perences but cardinal utilities as well name unmitigated 
 
approval voting avoids the issue of multiple sincere votes in special cases when voters have dichotomous perences  for a voter with dichotomous perences approval voting is  also known as strategy freebrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 31   when all voters have dichotomous perences and vote the sincere strategy proof vote approval voting is guaranteed to elect the condorcet winner if one existsbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 38   however having dichotomous perences when there are three or more candidates is not typical  it is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous perences when there are more than a few voters name probstrat 
having dichotomous perences means that a voter has bi level perences for the candidates  all of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top level group is perred to any candidate in the bottom level groupbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser pp 16 17   a voter that has strict perences between three candidates—pers a to b and b to c—does not have dichotomous perences
being strategy proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote regardless of how others vote in approval voting the strategy proof vote if it exists is a sincere vote name sinceredef 
 
another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal perence model with an approval or acceptance threshold  an approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of  a voter can approve of more than one candidate and still per one approved candidate to another approved candidate  acceptance thresholds are similar  with such a threshold a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold name probstrat 
with threshold voting it is still possible to not elect the  and instead elect the  when they both exist  however according to steven brams this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting  without providing specifics he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the  and other social choice criteria name critstrats 
voting strategy under approval is guided by two competing features of approval voting  on the one hand approval voting fails the  so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more perred candidate  on the other hand approval voting satisfies the  so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win but can cause that candidate to lose to a less perred candidate  either way the voter can risk getting a less perred election winner  a voter can balance the risk benefit trade offs by considering the voters cardinal utilities particularly via the  and the probabilities of how others vote
a  described by  and weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating   this strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voters  subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large
an optimal approval vote always votes for the most perred candidate and not for the least perred candidate  however an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more perred candidate if there 4 candidates or moresmith warren http  wwwmathtempleedu ~wds homepage newgibbsatpdf completion of gibbard satterthwaite impossibility theorem range voting and voter honesty actually there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates and definitely none for 3 candidates the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown 
other strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations  for example
 vote for the candidates that have above average utility  this strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likelybrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 85 
 vote for any candidate that is more perred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more perred than the expected runner up  this strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities
vote for the most perred candidate only  this strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating
another strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates the candidates that have an above median utility when the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly the strategy maximizes the voters power or efficacy meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate winsbrams steven and fishburn peter 1983 approval voting boston birkhäuser p 74 81 
optimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the  and can elect a    strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the  in some special circumstances  for example if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small probability statistically independent errors in recording the votes then the winner will be the condorcet winner if one existslaslier j f 2006 http  halshsarchives ouvertesfr docs 00 12 17 51 pdf stratapproval4pdf strategic approval voting in a large electorate idep working papers no 405 marseille france institut deconomie publique

in the first scenario voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely  as a result they vote for any candidate with an above average utility  most voters vote for only their first choice  only the knoxville faction also votes for its second choice chattanooga  as a result the winner is memphis the condorcet loser with chattanooga coming in second place
in the second scenario all of the voters expect that memphis is the likely winner that chattanooga is the likely runner up and that the pivot probability for a memphis chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair wise ties  as a result each voter votes for any candidate they per more than the leading candidate and also vote for the leading candidate if they per that candidate more than the expected runner up each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies
in the second scenario there is a three way tie for first place  this happens because the expected winner memphis was the condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first
only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner up match the expected winner and runner up  as a result this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario in the language of  this is an equilibrium  in this scenario the winner is also the condorcet winner
as this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method modelling voters with a dichotomous cutoff assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff while having meaningful cardinal perences this means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates or all candidates above the average approval which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out resulting in a system that does not satisfy iia they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval cutoff that they have decided this cutoff does not change regardless of which and how many candidates are running so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff the voter votes for all or none of the candidates despite perring some over others  while this extreme appears unrealistic it actually lects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of in this way there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff and would not simply vote for their top 3 or the above average candidates although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable
for example   in this scenario voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate

most of the mathematical criteria by which voting systems are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal perences in this case approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff see examples above depending on how this decision is made approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria
there is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered but the following are criteria that  many voting theorists accept and considered desirable
 —a voter may have any perence ordering among the alternatives
 —there does not exist a single voter whose perence for the alternatives always determines the outcome regardless of other voters perences
 —if every voter pers candidate a to all other candidates then a must be elected from 
 —if there exists a majority that ranks or rates a single candidate higher than all other candidates does that candidate always win
 —is it impossible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher or to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking him lower
 —if the electorate is divided in two and a choice wins in both parts does it always win overall
 —is voting honestly always better than not voting at all this is grouped with the distinct but similar consistency criterion in the table belowconsistency implies participation but not vice versa for example score voting complies with participation and consistency but median ratings satisfies participation and fails consistency 
 —if a candidate beats every other candidate in  does that candidate always win this implies the majority criterion above
 —if a candidate loses to every other candidate in pairwise comparison does that candidate always lose
 —is the outcome the same after adding or removing non winning candidates
 —is the outcome the same if candidates identical to existing candidates are added
 —if individual perences of each voter are inverted does the original winner never win

 approval voting can allow voters to cast a compromise vote without abandoning their favorite candidate as long as voters accept the potential of that compromise vote resulting in the defeat of their favorite plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a lesser of evils to win
 approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections as ballots are cast so that final tallies are immediately available after the election without any upgrades to equipment approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level
 if voters are sincere approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme if backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and bullet vote for that first choice they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere perences
 if voters are sincere candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so however a candidate may win a  race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups
 approval voting fails the  because a candidate who is perred by a majority of voters is not always elected in some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate perred by a mere majority if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority in other cases with elections having three or more candidates approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also perred by a majority if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective ie vote only for the extreme candidate leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented
 suppose a candidate is eliminated say for medical reasons between a primary election and the party convention with plurality voting voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates
 approval voting without write ins is easily reversed as  where a choice is disavowed as is already required in other measures in politics eg representative 
 unlike plurality voting approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one increasing the probability an alternative wins
 in contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who per their favorite candidate vastly over all others approval voting may revert to  some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their perred candidate than as compromise choices  and  allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts
approval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections  a simple way to do so is as block approval voting a simple variant on  where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win  this does not provide  and is subject to the  among other problems
other ways of extending approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised among these are  and   for determining a proportional assembly and minimax approval  for determining a consensus assembly where the least satisfied voter is satisfied the most
approval ballots can be of at least four semi distinct forms the simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand write the names of the candidates they support a more structured ballot lists all candidates and voters mark each candidate they support a more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each candidate list ballots can include spaces for write in candidates as well
{  border
  
  
  
  
  
 }
all four ballots are theoretically equivalent the more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices the yes no format can help to detect an undervote when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct the single bubble format is incapable of producing invalid ballots which might otherwise be rejected in counting
unless the second or fourth format is used fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot that is it does not make it appear inconsistent thus approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the chain of custody of ballots is secure

alfred jarry  8 september 1873 – 1 november 1907 was a french  writer who is best known for his play  1896jarry alfred “ubu roi” dover 2003  he also coined the term and philosophical concept of https  wwwbookbytecom textbooks pataphysics 9780810118775 0810118777 pataphysics   01 edition 
jarry was born in  france and his mother was from brotchie alastair alfred jarry a pataphysical life mit press 2013 isbn 978 0 262 01619 3  he was associated with the  movement his play  1896 is often cited as a forerunner of  and to the  and  movements of the 1920s and 1930s jarry wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles piguring the  he wrote plays novels poetry essays and speculative journalism his texts present us with pioneering work in the fields of  and 
at the lycée in  when he was 15 he led a group of boys who enjoyed poking fun at their well meaning but obese and incompetent physics teacher a man named hébert jarry and his classmate henri morin wrote a play they called les polonais and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends the main character père heb was a blunderer with a huge belly three teeth one of stone one of iron and one of wood a single retractable ear and a misshapen body in jarrys later work ubu roi père heb would develop into ubu one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in french literature
at 17 jarry passed his  and moved to paris to prepare for admission to the École normale supérieure though he was not admitted he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose poems a collection of his work les minutes de sable mémorial was published in 1893
that same year both his parents died leaving him a small inheritance which he quickly spent
jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol which he called my sacred herb or when erring to  the green goddess a story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour and possibly under its influence
when he was drafted into the army in 1894 his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline the sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5 foot frame—the army did not issue uniforms small enough—was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons his military experience eventually inspired his novel days and nights
jarry returned to paris and applied himself to writing drinking and the company of friends who appreciated his witty sweet tempered and unpredictable conversation this period is marked by his intense involvement with  in the publication of  a luxuriously produced art magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints  as an art movement was in full swing at this time and lymagier provided a nexus for many of its key contributors jarrys play  1895 drew on this movement for material this is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which jarry would soon become associated using the biblical  as a point of departure caesar antichrist presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which christ is resurrected not as an agent of  but as an agent of the  that seeks to dominate spirituality it is a unique narrative that effectively links the domination of the soul to contemporaneous advances in the field of  such as the 1894 excavation of the  an ancient artifact used for situating the  within  the character ubu roi first appears in this playcody gabriele sprinchorn everet the columbia encyclopedia of modern drama volume 1 columbia university press 2007 isbn 9780231144223 page 53 
the spring of 1896 saw the publication in paul forts review le livre dart of jarrys 5 act play  — the rewritten and expanded les polonais of his school days ubu rois savage humor and monstrous absurdity unlike anything thus far performed in french theater seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage however impetuous theater director aurélien marie lugné poe took the risk producing the play at his théâtre de lŒuvre
on opening night 10 december 1896 with traditionalists and the  in the audience king ubu played by firmin gémier stepped forward and intoned the opening word merdre often translated as pshit or shittr in english a quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued outraged cries booing and whistling by the offended parties countered by cheers and applause by the more degenerate contingent such interruptions continued through the evening at the time only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held and the play was not revived until after jarrys death
the play brought fame to the 23 year old jarry and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created gémier had modeled his portrayal of ubu on jarrys own staccato nasal vocal delivery which emphasized each syllable even the silent ones from then on jarry would always speak in this style he adopted ubus ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech for example he erred to himself using the  and called the wind that which blows and the bicycle he rode everywhere that which rolls
jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition the diminutive jarry could just manage to stand up in the place but guests had to bend or crouch jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver in response to a neighbors complaint that his target shooting endangered her children he replied if that should ever happen ma da me we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you

amalric   1136 – 11 july 1174 was  from 1163 and  before his accession he was the second son of  and  and succeeded his older brother  during his reign jerusalem became more closely allied with the  and the two states launched an unsuccessful  meanwhile the muslim territories surrounding jerusalem began to be united under  and later  he was the father of three future rulers of jerusalem   and 
older scholarship mistook the two names amalric and aimery as variant spellings of the same name so these historians erroneously added numbers making amalric to be amalric i 1163–74 and king  1197–1205 to be amalric ii now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries a history of cyprus vol 2 cambridge university press 2010 1947 p 45 n 1 
amalric was born in 1136 to king fulk the former  who had married the heiress of the kingdom melisende daughter of king  after the death of fulk in a hunting accident in 1143 the throne passed jointly to melisende and amalrics older brother  who was still only 13 years old melisende did not step down when baldwin came of age two years later and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other in 1152 baldwin had himself crowned sole king and civil war broke out with melisende retaining  while baldwin held territory further north amalric who had been given the  as an  when he reached the age of majority in 1151 remained loyal to melisende in jerusalem and when baldwin invaded the south amalric was besieged in the  with his mother melisende was defeated in this struggle and baldwin ruled alone thereafter in 1153 baldwin captured the ian fortress of  which was then added to amalrics fief of jaffa see 
amalric married  in 1157 agnes daughter of  had lived in jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader  were lost in 1150  objected to the marriage on grounds of  as the two shared a great great grandfather  and it seems that they waited until fulchers death to marry agnes bore amalric three children  the future  both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right and alix who died in childhood
baldwin iii died on 10 february 1163 and the kingdom passed to amalric although there was some opposition among the nobility to agnes they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when baldwin iii was still capable of siring an heir but now the  used to endorse amalric as king unless his marriage to agnes was annulled the hostility to agnes it must be admitted may be exaggerated by the chronicler  whom she prevented from becoming  decades later as well as from williams continuators like  who hints at a slight on her moral character car telle nest que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de jherusalem there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as jerusalem nevertheless consanguinity was enough for the opposition amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife although agnes continued to hold the title countess of jaffa and ascalon and received a pension from that fiefs income agnes soon thereafter married  to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with amalric the church ruled that amalric and agnes children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession through her children agnes would exert much influence in jerusalem for almost 20 years
during baldwin iiis reign the county of edessa the first  established during the  was conquered by  the turkic emir of  zengi united aleppo  and other cities of northern syria and intended to impose his control on  in the south the  in 1148 had failed to conquer damascus which soon fell to zengis son  jerusalem also lost influence to byzantium in northern syria when the empire imposed its suzerainty over the  jerusalem thus turned its attention to egypt where the  was suffering from a series of young s and civil wars the crusaders had wanted to conquer egypt since the days of  who died during an expedition there the capture of ascalon by baldwin iii made the conquest of egypt more feasible
amalric led his first expedition into egypt in 1163 claiming that the fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of baldwin iii the vizier dirgham had recently overthrown the vizier  and marched out to meet amalric at  but was defeated and forced to retreat to  the egyptians then opened up the  dams and let the river flood hoping to prevent amalric from invading any further amalric returned home but shawar fled to the court of nur ad din who sent his general  to settle the dispute in 1164 in response dirgham sought help from amalric but shirkuh and shawar arrived before amalric could intervene and dirgham was killed shawar however feared that shirkuh would seize power for himself and he too looked to amalric for assistance amalric returned to egypt in 1164 and besieged shirkuh in bilbeis until shirkuh retreated to damascus
amalric could not follow up on his success in egypt because nur ad din was active in syria having taken  and  prisoner at the  during amalrics absence amalric rushed to take up the regency of antioch and tripoli and secured bohemunds ransom in 1165 raymond remained in captivity until 1173 the year 1166 was relatively quiet but amalric sent envoys to the  seeking an alliance and a byzantine wife and throughout the year had to deal with raids by nur ad din who captured 
in 1167 nur ad din sent shirkuh back to egypt and amalric once again followed him establishing a camp near  shawar again allied with amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph  himself shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the  after an indecisive battle amalric retreated to cairo and shirkuh marched north to capture  amalric followed and besieged shirkuh there aided by a pisan fleet from jerusalem   shirkuh negotiated for peace and alexandria was handed over to amalric however amalric could not remain there indefinitely and returned to jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute
after his return to jerusalem in 1167 amalric married  a great grandniece of   the negotiations had taken two years mostly because amalric insisted that manuel return  to jerusalem once amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry maria in  on august 29 1167 during this time the queen dowager baldwin iiis widow  eloped with her cousin  to  and  which had been in her possession reverted into the royal domain of jerusalem it was also around this time that  was promoted to  of tyre and was recruited by amalric to write a history of the kingdom
in 1168 amalric and manuel negotiated an alliance against egypt and william of tyre was among the ambassadors sent to  to finalize the treaty although amalric still had a peace treaty with shawar shawar was accused of attempting to ally with nur ad din and amalric invaded the  eagerly supported this invasion while the  used to have any part in it in october without waiting for any byzantine assistance and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return amalric invaded and seized bilbeis the inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved amalric then marched to cairo where shawar offered amalric two million pieces of gold meanwhile nur ad din sent shirkuh back to egypt as well and upon his arrival amalric retreated
in january 1169 shirkuh had shawar assassinated shirkuh became vizier although he himself died in march and was succeeded by his nephew  amalric became alarmed and sent   to seek help from the kings and nobles of europe but no assistance was forthcoming later that year however a byzantine fleet arrived and in october amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged  by sea and by land the siege was long and famine broke out in the christian camp the byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure and a truce was signed with saladin amalric returned home
now jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies in 1170 saladin invaded jerusalem and took the city of  severing jerusalems connection with the red sea saladin who was set up as vizier of egypt was declared sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last fatimid caliph saladins rise to sultan was an unexpected reprieve for jerusalem as nur ad din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal nevertheless in 1171 amalric visited constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of europe for a second time but again no help was received over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by saladin and nur ad din but also by the  in one episode the knights templar murdered some hashshashin envoys leading to further disputes between amalric and the templars
nur ad din died in 1174 upon which amalric immediately besieged banias on the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from  which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in jerusalem william of tyre explains that after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days he ordered physicians of the greek syrian and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy neither they nor latin doctors could help and he died on july 11 1174
maria comnena had borne amalric two daughters  who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen was born in 1172 and a stillborn child some time later on his deathbed amalric bequeathed  to maria and isabella both of whom would retire there the  child  succeeded his father and brought his mother agnes of courtenay now married to her fourth husband back to court
william was a good friend of amalric and described him in great detail he had a slight impediment in his speech not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence he was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech like his brother baldwin iii he was more of an academic than a warrior who studied law and languages in his leisure time he was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact he was second to no one in this respect he was probably responsible for  making all rear vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the haute cour amalric had an enormous curiosity and william was reportedly astonished to find amalric questioning during an illness the  of the body he especially enjoyed reading and being read to spending long hours listening to william read early drafts of his history he did not enjoy games or spectacles although he liked to hunt he was trusting of his officials perhaps too trusting and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him although he used to take any action against those who insulted him publicly
he was tall and fairly handsome he had sparkling eyes of medium size his nose like that of his brother was becomingly aquiline his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead a comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin he had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook he did not overeat or drink to excess but his corpulence grew in his later years decreasing his interest in military operations according to william he was excessively fat with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist
amalric was pious and attended mass every day although he also is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women despite his piety he taxed the clergy which they naturally opposed
as william says he was a man of wisdom and discretion fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom he is considered the last of the early  after whom there was no king able to save jerusalem from its eventual collapse within a few years emperor manuel died as well and saladin remained the only strong leader in the east

one of the main reasons ascii art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks also to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users bulk printers often used ascii art to print large banners making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk ascii art was also used in early e mail when images could not be embedded  ascii art can also be used for typesetting

the widespread usage of ascii art can be traced to the computer s of the late 1970s and early 1980s the limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images along with asciis use in communication however it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period an ascii comic is a form of webcomic which uses ascii text to create images in place of images in a regular comic ascii art is used with the text or dialog usually placed underneath

so called block ascii or high ascii uses the extended characters of the 8 bit  which is a proprietary standard introduced by  in 1979 ansi standard x316 for the ibm pc dos and ms dos operating systems block asciis were widely used on the pc during the 1990s until the internet replaced bbses as the main communication platform until then block asciis dominated the  name asciistyleshttp  wwwroysaccom roy sac_styles_of_underground_text_arthtml the three styles of the underground ascii art scene article 01 2006 roy  http  wwwroysaccom roysaccom  name ddarthistoryhttp  cdtextfilescom darkdomain www html history art_scenehtml an abbreviated history of the underground computer art scene by napalm 11 10 1998 the history of art and technology

there is some debate between ascii and block ascii artist with hardcore ascii artists maintaining that block ascii art is in fact not  because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ascii standard on the other hand block ascii artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set then it is to be called ascii regardless if the character set is proprietary or not  original sentence was entirely ungrammatical i hope this one gets the proper meaning across  
microsoft windows does not support the  x316 one can view block asciis with a text editor using the font  but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist with a special ascii ansi viewer such as acidview for windows see ascii and ansi art viewers one can see block ascii and ansi files properly an example that  in appearance is part of this article alternatively one could look at the file using the type command in the command prompt
 
in the art scene one popular ascii style that used the 7 bit standard ascii character set was the so called oldskool style it is also called amiga style due to its origin and widespread use on the  computers the style uses primarily the characters tt_ \ +  tt the oldskool art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures
this is an example of  style also erred to as old school or oldskool style  ascii art name asciistyles  
the amiga ascii scene surfaced in 1992 seven years after the introduction of the commodore  the commodore 64 petscii scene did not make the transition to the commodore amiga as the c64 demo and warez scenes did among the first amiga ascii art groups were art epsilon design upper class unreal later known as dezign this means that the text art scene on the amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the pc the amiga artists also did not call their ascii art style oldskool that term was introduced on the pc when and by whom is unknown and lost in history
the amiga style ascii artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file which included all the artwork usually requested with some design parts in between as opposed to the pc art scene where the art work was released as a  with separate text files for each piece furthermore the releases were usually called ascii collections and not art packs like on the ibm pc

the east coast comprises three or four traditionally and linguistically distinct regions each of which possessing english varieties distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse  the  the  centering on philadelphia and baltimore and the  after the  the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the eastern us led to dialect mixing and leveling  so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the ern  the  and  is usually regarded as the southern western extent of new england speech which has its roots in the speech of the puritans from  who settled in the 
the  generally divides a group of northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the coastal southern dialect area in between these two rivers several local variations exist chief among them the one that prevails in and around  and northern  which developed on a dutch  after the english conquered new amsterdam the main features of coastal southern speech can be traced to the speech of the english from the  who settled in virginia after leaving england at the time of the 
a distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between  and the united states centered on the  region but only on the american side linguists call this region the  as defined by its unique —occurring in the same region whose standard midwestern speech was the basis for  in the mid 20th century though prior to this recent vowel shift those not from this area frequently confuse it with the north midland dialect treated below erring to both plus areas to the immediate west of the great lakes region all collectively as  a common but vaguely delineated term for what is now the central or north central united states the so called  dialect is also prevalent in the cultural  and is characterized by influences from the german and scandinavian settlers of the region like yah for yes pronounced similarly to ja in german norwegian and swedish in parts of  and  another dialect known as  is also spoken
between the traditional american north and south is what linguists have long called the midland this geographically overlaps with some states situated in the lower midwest west of the  begins the broad zone of modern day  speech this is divided into two discrete subdivisions the north midland that begins north of the  valley area and the south midland speech which to the american ear has some slight trace of a  sometimes the former region is designated simply midland and the latter is labelled as highland southern the north midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related western dialect which contains  as well as  although in the immediate  area some older speakers do not possess the  and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which lects a historical mid atlantic heritage
the south midland or highland southern dialect follows the  in a generally southwesterly direction moves across  and  west of the  and peters out in  it is a version of the midland speech that has assimilated some coastal southern forms outsiders often mistakenly believe south midland speech and coastal south speech to be the same
although no longer region specificcf trudgill p42   which remains prevalent among s has a close relationship to southern varieties of american english and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many americans
the island state of hawaii though primarily english speaking is also home to a  known commonly as 
dialect development in the united states has further been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as             etc which imposed their linguistic marks on the surrounding areas
compared with  north american english trudgill p 2 is a collective term used for the varieties of the english language that are spoken in both the united states and   is more homogeneous and any accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as  some distinctive accents can be found on the  for example in eastern  new york city philadelphia and baltimore partly because these areas were in close contact with  and imitated prestigious varieties of english at a time when these were undergoing changestrudgill pp 46–47  in addition many speech communities on the east coast have existed in their present locations for centuries while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing united states and developed a far more general linguistic pattern
studies on historical usage of english in the united states and the united kingdom suggest that spoken american english did not simply evolve from period british english but rather retained many archaic features contemporary  has since lost  most north american speech is  because in the 17th century when english was brought to the americas most english in england was rhotic rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of   and   in most varieties of north american english the sound corresponding to the letter r is a   or   rather than a trill or tap as often heard for example in the english accents of scotland or india a unique bunched tongue variant of the approximant r sound is also associated with the united states and seems particularly noticeable in the midwest and southa handbook of varieties of english bernd kortmann amp edgar w schneider walter de gruyter 2004 p 317  the loss of the r sound after a vowel for example causing spar to sound like spa known as non rhoticity is confined in the united states mostly to the accents of  the   and the  nowadays the vowel consonant cluster found in bird work hurt learn etc usually retains its r pronunciation even in otherwise non rhotic accents on the other hand dropping of syllable final r may sometimes happen in natively rhotic dialects if r is located in unaccented syllables wherein the next syllable or word begins in a consonant for example many north americans drop the first r in particular in england the lost r was often changed into   giving rise to a new class of falling s furthermore the er sound of fur or butter is realized in ame as a al  stressed  or unstressed  as represented in the  this does not happen in the non rhotic varieties of north american speech
some other english changes in which most north american dialects do not participate
 the realization of intervocalic  as a glottal stop  as in  for butter the only environment in which t glottalization is standard in american english is before syllabic  as in button 
on the other hand north american english has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of english speech
 the  making father and bother rhyme this change is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in north american english exceptions are in northeastern  such as the     and many  such as the  name wells    wells 1982 245–47   labov et al 2006 p 171 
 the merger of  and  in many areas this is the so called  where cot and caught are s this change has occurred in eastern new england boston area in  and surrounding areas and from the  westward
 for speakers who do not merge caught and cot the replacement of the cot vowel with the caught vowel in many cases before s as in cloth off which is found in some old fashioned varieties of rp as well as before  as in strong long usually in gone often in on and irregularly before  log hog dog fog which is not found in british english at all
 the from rum merger consisting of the replacement of the lot vowel with the strut vowel in most utterances of the words was of from what and in many utterances of the words everybody nobody somebody anybody the word because has either  or  this is directly due to influence of the according to merriam webster collegiate dictionary eleventh edition for speakers who merge caught and cot  is to be understood as the vowel they have in both caught and cot  want has normally  or  sometimes    
  before intervocalic  which vowels are affected varies between dialects but the   and  mergers are found in many american english dialects americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of ampmdashsuch as those in  and ampmdashsometimes monophthongizing towards  and  or  towards  and  respectively causing pronunciations like  for pair pear and  for peer pier  also  is often reduced to  so that cure pure and mature may all end with the sound  thus rhyming with blur and sir the word sure is also part of this rhyming set as commonly pronounced

  in environments that vary widely from accent to accent with most american speakers for whom the phoneme  operates under a somewhat continuous system  has both a tense and a lax  with a kind of continuum of possible sounds between those two extremes rather than a definitive split in these accents  is overall realized before s as more tense approximately  while other environments are more lax approximately the standard  for example note the vowel sound in  for mass  but  for man in some american accents though specifically those from   and   and  are entirely separate or split phonemes for example in planet  vs plan it  this is often called the mid atlantic  system note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed british broad a the phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern new england boston area who  to  the so called  before  alone or when preceded by a  nasal

l velarization englands typical distinction between a clear l ie  and a dark l ie  or sometimes even  is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of american english it may even be altogether absent  instead most us speakers pronounce all l sounds with a tendency to be dark meaning with some degree of   the only notable exceptions to this are in some spanish influenced us english varieties such as  which typically shows a clear l in s and in older   of the us where l is clear in an  environment between sa handbook of varieties of english bernd kortmann amp edgar w schneider walter de gruyter 2004 p 319

north america has given the english  many thousands of words meanings and phrases several thousand are now used in english as spoken internationally
the process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora fauna and topography from the   examples of such names are    and  from   other native american loanwords such as  or  describe articles in common use among native americans the languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the american vocabulary for instance    and pit of a fruit from     from http  germanaboutcom library blvoc_gerloanhtm aboutcomampnbsp–   portage carrying of boats or goods and probably  from    and  from     
among the earliest and most notable regular english additions to the american vocabulary dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century are terms describing the features of the north american landscape for instance run branch fork    neck of the woods barrens  notch knob riffle s watergap cutoff   and  already existing words such as    and in later use  received new meanings that were unknown in england
other noteworthy american s are found among loanwords for example   french   via louisiana french  canadian french but used also in louisiana with a different meaning    spanish vlei skate  dutch 
the word  used in england to er to wheat or any cereal came to denote the plant  the most important crop in the us originally named  by the earliest settlers wheat rye barley oats etc came to be collectively erred to as  other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by  not only a building for hay and grain storage but also for housing livestock and team not just the horses but also the vehicle along with them as well as in various periods the terms      and 
 later applied to a  derives from  most spanish contributions came after the  with the opening of the west among these are other than toponyms  from chaparreras      examples of english additions from the  era are bad man maverick chuck food and  from the  came such idioms as hit pay dirt or strike it rich the word blizzard probably originated in the west a couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb belittle and the noun bid both first used in writing by

ever since the  a great number of terms connected with the us political institutions have entered the language examples are run ie for office gubernatorial   after the  repeater  a  term used originally in banking  and  some of these are internationally used for example    
 
the development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words phrases and idioms typical examples are the vocabulary of ing see further at  and ation terminology ranging from names of roads from dirt roads and back roads to s and s to road infrastructure    and from automotive terminology to  for example in the sentence riding the subway downtown such american introductions as commuter from commutation ticket  to board a vehicle to park double park and parallel park a car  or the noun terminal have long been used in all dialects of englisha few of these are now chiefly found or have been more productive outside of the us for example jump to drive past a traffic signal block meaning building and center central point in a town or main area for a particular activity cf oxford english dictionary 
trades of various kinds have endowed american english with household words describing jobs and occupations  longshoreman patrolman   bellhop     boss from dutch     businesses and workplaces           hock also from dutch as well as general concepts and innovations     reservation as at hotels pay envelope  mileage   
already existing english words—such as   dry goods  —underwent shifts in meaning some—such as  student  the verbs can as in canned goods ship fix carry enroll as in school run as in run a business release and haul—were given new significations while others such as  have retained meanings that disappeared in england from the world of business and finance came       from sports terminology came jargon aside monday morning quarterback cheap shot game plan  in the  out of  off base hit and run and  from  gamblers coined    bottom dollar raw deal pass the buck ace in the hole freeze out showdown miners coined  bonanza peter out pan out and the verb prospect from the noun and railroadmen are to be credited with make the  sidetrack head on and the verb railroad a number of americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to north america    many automotive terms fall in this category although many do not        to exhaust
in addition to the above mentioned loans from french spanish mexican spanish dutch and native american languages other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration notably from   schmooze tush and — and culinary terms like frankfurter franks liverwurst sauerkraut       musical terminology   etc and apparently  fresh impudent and what gives such constructions as are you coming with and i like to dance for i like dancing may also be the result of german or yiddish influence 2004 new dialect formation the inevitability of colonial englishes 
finally a large number of english colloquialisms from various periods are american in origin some have lost their american flavor from  and cool to  and  while others have not  for sure   many are now distinctly old fashioned swell groovy some english words now in general use such as hijacking  boost bulldoze and  originated as american slang among the many english idioms of us origin are get the hang of bark up the wrong tree keep tabs run scared take a backseat have an edge over stake a claim take a shine to in on the ground floor bite off more than one can chew off on the wagon stay put inside track  bad hair day  under the weather jump bail come clean come again it aint over till its over and what goes around comes around

the us is largely divided about the generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage nearly 53% of the surveyed sample say soda particularly in the northeast   the far  and some of  over 25% say pop particularly around the  including the  and the western regions along the canadian border over 12% say coke which is also trademarked for a  particularly scattered throughout the  urban coastal california speakers use all three terms though especially soda speakers of the  generally use soda or popkatz joshua 2013 http  www4ncsuedu ~jakatz2 files dialectposterpng beyond soda pop or coke north carolina state university 
the most common words to address a group of two or more people in the second  are the phrase you guys at almost 43% particularly throughout the northeast and great lakes region along with simply you at nearly 13% yall is perred by 14% particularly in the south but reaching somewhat into the northern regions as well youse is largely confined to the new york and philadelphia metropolitan areas at just over half of 1%
the most common term for generic rubber soled shoes worn for athletic activities is sneakers as said by 46% throughout the country but particularly in the northeast 41% particularly outside of the northeast say tennis shoes several much rarer other terms may also be used in various regions of the country
nearly 68% of american english speakers make no distinction between  and  or simply never use the term supper
64% of american speakers say where are you at to mean how are you coming along this also incorporates the 34% who use where are you at in any context for example to even mean where are you physically located right now
small  are known by 40% of polled speakers as crawfish 32% as crayfish and 19% as crawdads within no particular regional boundaries though crayfish seems fairly uncommon in the south
the most common nicknames for grandparents are grandpa grampa and grandma gramma
nearly all american english speakers call the  a fily or lightning bug with nearly 40% using the two terms interchangeably
american english and  bre often differ at the levels of phonology phonetics vocabulary and to a much lesser extent grammar and orthography
the first large american dictionary  was written by  in 1828 codifying several of these spellings
differences in grammar are relatively minor and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility these include different use of some  formal rather than notional agreement with s different perences for the past forms of a few verbs for example ame bre learned learnt burned burnt snuck sneaked dove dived although the purportedly british forms can occasionally be seen in american english writing as well different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts for example ame in school bre at school  when it means to be a student   and whether or not a definite article is used in very few cases ame to the hospital bre to hospital contrast however ame actress elizabeth taylor bre the actress elizabeth taylor often these differences are a matter of relative perences rather than absolute rules and most are not stable since the two varieties are constantly influencing each otheralgeo john 2006 british or american english cambridge cambridge university press isbn 0 521 37993 8  and american english is not a standardized set of dialects
differences in  are also minor the main differences are that american english usually uses spellings such as flavor for british flavour fiber for fibre defense for defence analyze for analyse catalog for catalogue and traveling for travelling noah webster popularized such spellings in america but he did not invent most of them rather he chose already existing options  on such grounds as simplicity analogy or etymologyalgeo john the effects of the revolution on language in a companion to the american revolution john wiley amp sons 2008 p599  other differences are due to the  tastes of 19th century  for example they perred programme for program manoeuvre for maneuver cheque for check etcpeters pam 2004 the cambridge guide to english usage cambridge cambridge university press isbn 0 521 62181 x pp 34 and 511  ame almost always uses  ize in words like realize bre pers  ise but also uses  ize see 
there are a few differences in punctuation rules british english is more tolerant of run on sentences called comma splices in american english and american english requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which british rules would place them outside american english also favors the double quotation mark over single name apa 
ame sometimes favors words that are  more complex whereas bre uses clipped forms such as ame transportation and bre transport or where the british form is a  such as ame burglarize and bre burgle from burglar however while individuals usually use one or the other both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems
british english also differ from american english in that some british words are pronounced with silent letters than are normally heard in ame such as the silent c in schedule

albert goodwill spalding september 2 1849 – september 9 1915 was an american   and executive in the early years of professional  and the co founder of  sporting goods company he played major league baseball between 1871 and 1878 a popular myth is that spalding became the first well known player to use a fielding glove in 1877 because such gloves were among the items sold at his sporting goods store field gloves were regularly used in the mid 1870s http  wwwnprorg templates story storyphpstoryid 1413207 
after his retirement as a player spalding remained active with the  as president and part owner in the 1880s he took players on the first world tour of baseball with  spalding organized the  he later called for the commission that investigated the origins of baseball and credited  with creating the game he also wrote the first set of official baseball rules
having played baseball throughout his youth spalding first played competitively with the  pioneers a youth team which he joined in 1865 after pitching his team to a 26–2 victory over a local mens amateur team the mercantiles he was approached at the age of 15 by another the forest citys for whom he played for two years name starr  in the autumn of 1867 he accepted a 40 per week contract nominally as a clerk but really to play professionally for the chicago excelsiors not an uncommon arrangement used to circumvent the rules of the time which forbade the hiring of professional players following the formation of baseballs first professional organization the  which became known as the national association the association or na in 1871 spalding joined the  precursor club to the modern  and was highly successful  206 games and losing only 53 as a pitcher and  323 as a hitter
 principal owner of the  did not like the loose organization of the national association and the gambling element that influenced it so he decided to create a new organization which he dubbed the  of baseball clubs to aid him in this venture hulbert enlisted the help of spalding playing to the pitchers desire to return to his midwestern roots and challenging spaldings integrity hulbert convinced spalding to sign a contract to play for the white stockings now known as the  in 1876 spalding then coaxed teammates   and  as well as  players  and  to sign with chicago this was all done under complete secrecy during the playing season because players were all free agents in those days and they did not want their current club and especially the fans to know they were leaving to play elsewhere the next year news of the signings by the boston and philadelphia players leaked to the press before the season ended and all of them faced verbal abuse and physical threats from the fans of those cities
he was the premier pitcher of the 1870s leading the league in victories for each of his six full seasons as a professional name   fame   during each of those years he was his teams only pitcher name pbs  in 1876 spalding won 47 games as the prime pitcher for the white stockings and led them to win the first ever national league  by a wide margin name   fame  
in 1877 spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand people had used gloves previously but never had a star like spalding used one spalding had an ulterior motive for doing so he now owned a sporting goods store which sold baseball gloves and wearing one himself was good advertising for his business
spalding retired from playing baseball in 1878 at the age of 27 although he continued as president and part owner of the white stockings and a major influence on the national league spaldings 796 career winning percentage from an era when teams played about once or twice a week is the highest ever achieved by a baseball pitcher
in the months after signing for chicago hulbert and spalding organized the national league by enlisting the four major teams in the east and the three other top teams in what was then considered to be the west joining chicago initially were the leading teams from   and  the owners of these western clubs accompanied hulbert and spalding to new york where they secretly met with owners from new york city   and  each signed the leagues constitution and the national league was officially born spalding was thus involved in the transformation of baseball from a game of gentlemen athletes into a business and a professional sport name   starr   although the national association held on for a few more seasons it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball gradually it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country
in 1905 after  wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the british sports of  and  spalding called for a  to find out the real source of baseball the commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters after three years of searching on december 30 1907 spalding received a letter that erroneously declared baseball to be the invention of  the commission though was biased as spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the english sport of rounders just before the commission in a letter to sportswriter  spalding noted our good old american game of baseball must have an american dad the project later called the mills commission concluded that base ball had its origins in the united states and the first scheme for playing baseball according to the best evidence available to date was devised by abner doubleday at  in 1839
receiving the archives of henry chadwick in 1908 spalding combined these records with his own memories and biases to write  published 1911 which despite its flaws was probably the first scholarly account of the  name   pbs  
in 1874 while spalding was playing and organizing the league spalding and his brother walter began a sporting goods store in chicago which grew rapidly 14 stores by 1901 and expanded into a manufacturer and distributor of all kinds of sporting equipment the company became synonymous with sporting goods name   starr   and is still a going concern
spalding published the first official rules guide for baseball in it he stated that only spalding balls could be used previously the quality of the balls used had been subpar spalding also founded the baseball guide which at the time was the most widely read baseball publication
in 1888–1889 spalding took a group of major league players around the world to promote baseball and  this was the first ever world baseball tour name   fame   playing across the western us the tour made stops in hawaii although no game was played new zealand australia  egypt italy france and england the tour returned to grand receptions in new york philadelphia and chicago the tour included future rs cap anson and  while the players were on the tour the national league instituted new rules regarding player pay that led to a revolt of players led by ward who started the  the following season 1890 the league lasted one year partially due to the anti competitive tactics of spalding to limit its success  the tour and formation of the players league is depicted in the 2015 movie deadballhttp  wwwimdbcom title tt4531902 _ fn_al_tt_2 
in 1900 spalding was appointed by  as the usas commissioner at that years  name   pbs  
spalding had been a prominent member of the theosophical society under   in 1900 spalding moved to  with his newly acquired second wife elizabeth name   starr   and became a prominent member and supporter of the  community  which was being developed on  by  he built an estate in the  area of point loma where he lived with elizabeth for the rest of his life the spaldings raised race horses and collected chinese fine furniture and art
the spaldings had an extensive library which included many volumes on theosophy art and literature in 1907–09 he was the driving force behind the development of a paved road known as the point loma boulevard from downtown san diego to point loma and  the road also provided good access to lomaland it later provided the basis for   he proposed the project supervised it on behalf of the city and paid a portion of the cost out of his own pocket he joined with  and other civic minded businessmen to purchase the site of the original  which they developed as a historic park and eventually donated to the city of san diego name marston  he ran unsuccessfully for the  in 1910 name   marston   he helped to organize the 1915  serving as second vice president

acquire is a  designed by  name hg  the game was originally published in 1962 by  as a part of their  in most versions the theme of the game is investing in  chains in the 1990s  edition the hotel chains were replaced by generic corporations though the actual gameplay was unchanged the game is currently published by hasbro under the  brand and the companies are once again hotel chains
the object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains when a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain at the end of the game all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money
the components of the game have varied over the years in particular the tiles have been made from wood plastic and cardboard in various editions of the game in the current 2008 version the tiles are cardboard the following components are included in all versions
 game board with 108 spaces arranged in a 12 by 9 array
 108 tiles corresponding to the squares in the array
 7 markers one for each of the hotel chains american continental festival imperial luxor or sackson in the 2008 version tower and worldwide
 25 shares of stock for each of the seven hotel chains
 a supply of play money in denominations of 100 500 1000 and 5000
 6 charts listing the prices of shares of the chains
the array on the game board is arranged with lettered rows a through i and numbered columns 1 through 12 the 108 tiles correspond to each of the squares 5e 10b and so forth
acquire is a game for three to six players though earlier editions included special rules for two players standard tournament games are played with four players
at the beginning of the game each player receives 6000 in cash each player draws a tile and places it on the board the player whose tile is in the topmost row closest to row a goes first if more than one player selects a tile in that row then the player whose tile is in the leftmost column closest to 1 goes first all players place these tiles on the board then starting with the first player each player draws six tiles
a turn consists of three steps
# placing a tile
# buying stock
# drawing a replacement tile
tile placement falls in one of four categories the tile placed could be an orphan adjacent to no other tile on the board the tile could create a new chain of tiles and the player who placed it on the board would have the opportunity to found a new chain the tile could increase the length of an existing chain already on the board or the tile could link two chains causing a merger of two or more chains since there are only seven hotel chains in the game placing a tile that would create an eighth chain is not permitted
when a player founds a chain he receives one free share of stock in that chain if however there are no shares left when the chain is founded then the founding player does not receive the free share
chains are deemed safe if they have 11 or more links placing a tile that would cause such a chain to be acquired by a larger chain is also not permitted
after a player places a tile and the results of that placement have been handled he may purchase up to three shares of stock a player may only purchase shares of stock in chains that have already been founded the price of a share depends on the size of the chain according to a chart that lists prices according to size a player may purchase shares in one two or three existing chains assuming at least three chains are currently in play in any combination up to a total of three shares
finally the player replaces the tile he played ensuring that he has six tiles at the end of his turn
a chain is a conglomeration of tiles that are linked to each other orthogonally but not diagonally for example adjacent to square 5f are squares 4f 6f 5e and 5g but not 6e or 4g if there is a tile in 5f then placing either tile 4f or 5g would result in founding a new hotel chain a chain grows when a player increases the length of a chain suppose a chain consists of squares 8d 8e and 8f playing tile 9f would add to the length of the chain playing tile 9c would not
chains merge when a player places the tile that eliminates the empty space between them suppose there is a chain at 1a 2a 3a and 4a along with another chain at 6a and 7a placing tile 5a would cause these two chains to merge when a merger occurs the larger hotel chain always acquires the smaller hotel chain that is the hotel chain with more tiles will continue to exist and now grows to include the smaller hotel chain after bonuses have been calculated according to the steps outlined below if a tile is placed between two hotel chains of the same size the individual player who places the tile decides which hotel chain remains on the board and which is acquired in this situation there are a number of strategic reasons why an individual player might select one hotel chain over another to be the one that remains on the board however often it is most advantageous for the player selecting to choose to let the more expensive chains remain on the board and trade in their stock of the less expensive chain at the 2 to 1 ratio described below
the merger is the mechanism by which the players compete mergers yield bonuses for the two shareholders who hold respectively the largest and second largest interests in a chain mergers also give each player who holds any interest at all in a chain a chance to sell his stock or to trade it in for shares of the acquiring chain a merger takes place in three steps
# bonuses for majority and minority shareholders each player counts his or her stock in the acquired chain the player with the largest number of shares is the majority shareholder and the player with the second largest number of shares is the minority shareholder if two players tie for majority they will share both shareholder bonuses if two players tie for minority they will share the minority shareholder bonusbrsuppose festival is the chain being acquired alex owns 10 shares betty owns 8 and carla owns 6 alex is the majority shareholder and betty is the minority shareholderbrsuppose now that worldwide is the chain being acquired alex owns 8 shares betty owns 8 shares and carla owns 7 alex and betty would share the majority and minority bonuses and carla would get no bonus if instead betty and carla both owned 7 shares then alex would keep the majority bonus for herself while betty and carla would split the minority bonus
# sell trade or hold shares starting with the player who caused the merger to happen each player may either sell his shares in the acquired chain trade in two shares of the acquired chain for one share of the acquiring chain or hold on to his shares of the acquired chain shares are sold at the same price as the current cost of one share of stock in the acquired chain a player may trade in as many shares as he owns but may not trade in one share of the acquired chain for half a share of the acquiring chain if a player holds onto his stock he runs the risk that the acquired chain may not reemerge before the game ends if that happens then he will be holding worthless stock at the end of the game
# defunct chain the acquired chain then becomes defunct it is eligible to be founded again if another player founds a chain again in a later turn
if placing a tile causes three or four chains to merge then the merger steps are handled between the largest and second largest chain then with the third largest chain and finally with the smallest chain
any player may declare the game over at any time during his turn if either of two conditions is true one chain has 41 or more tiles or there is at least one chain on the board and every chain on the board has 11 or more tiles upon declaring the game over the player is allowed to complete his turn including buying stock ending the game is optional   if he believes it is to his advantage not to end the game he may rain from doing so once the game ends the minority and majority bonuses are paid to the minority and majority holders in each of the remaining chains each player sells his or her shares of stock in each of the remaining chains and the player with the most money wins because ending the game is optional and a player may not realize that he can end it it is unethical to say good game or in any other way indicate that the game could be ended until after a player actually has ended the game
these conditions can be used to handle unusual situations
# replacing permanently unplayable tiles   per 1999 rules players can replace permanently unplayable tile tiles that would merge safe corporations at the end of their turn you may continue to replace unplayable tiles including new unplayable tiles that you draw until you have six playable tiles or the tile stock is empty
# no playable tiles   per 2008 rules a player that has no legal plays because all 6 tiles in his or her hand are unplayable may reveal his or her hand set aside his or her unplayable tiles and draw six new tiles at the beginning of his or her turn tiles set aside are discarded from the game
# bank doesnt have enough shares to allow everyone to trade in their shares   first choice falls to person causing the merger followed by other players in order around the table in the order of play
the rules allow any player to count the number of shares available in the bank however the rules do not specify whether a player should hold his shares of stock face up or face down that is the rules do not say whether one player may ask another how many shares of stock he or she owns in a particular chain whether this is public or private information should be agreed upon between players before the game begins
the current rules do not provide for a two player game however the stock market was used as a third shareholder in previous versions of the game by this rule a tile is drawn whenever a merger is declared the number on the tile indicates how many shares the stock market owns in the company that is being acquired the players must compete with the market as well as with each other in order to receive bonuses

australian english ause aue auseng en aucodeen au code is the  for australian english as defined by s see  and  and s see   is a major variety of the  and is used throughout  although english has no official status in the  australian english is the countrys  official language and is the 
australian english began to diverge from  after the founding of the  in 1788 and was recognised as being different from british english by 1820 it arose from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of  dialectal regions of the  and quickly developed into a distinct variety of english name clasmqeduau 
australian english differs from other varieties of english in      and 
the earliest form of australian english was first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the colony of  this first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation the australian born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the british isles in particular from  and  name moore 2008 69 
the native born children of the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them and with it expressed  even when new settlers arrived this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech
a quarter of the convicts were irish many had been arrested in ireland and some in great britain many if not most of the irish convicts spoke either no english at all or spoke it poorly and rarely there were other significant populations of convicts from non english speaking part of britain such as the  and 
records from the early 19th century show the distinct dialect that had surfaced in the colonies since  in 1788 name clasmqeduau  with s 1827 book two years in new south wales describing the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native born colonists different from that of their parents and with a strong  influence name moore 2008 69   writes that australian english may be thought of as a kind of fossilised cockney of the dickensian era 
the first of the  in the 1850s began a large wave of  during which about two per cent of the population of the united kingdom emigrated to the colonies of  and   according to linguist bruce moore the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the australian accent was from south east england name moore 2008 69 
some elements of  have been —mainly as names for places flora and fauna for example  and local culture many such are localised and do not form part of general australian use while others such as kangaroo boomerang budgerigar wallaby and so on have become international other examples are  and hard yakka the former is used as a high pitched call for attracting attention pronounced  which travels long distances cooee is also a notional distance if hes within cooee well spot him hard yakka means hard work and is derived from yakka from the  yagara language once spoken in the brisbane region
also of aboriginal origin is the word bung from the sydney  english and ultimately from the sydney aboriginal language meaning dead with some extension to broken or useless many towns or suburbs of australia have also been influenced or named after aboriginal words the best known example is the capital canberra named after a local language word meaning meeting place 
among the changes starting in the 19th century was the introduction of words spellings terms and usages from  the words imported included some later considered to be typically australian such as bushwhacker and squatter 
  
this american influence continued with the popularity of american films and the influx of american military personnel in  seen in the enduring persistence of such terms as okay you guys and gee name bell 
the primary way in which australian english is distinctive from other varieties of english is through its unique pronunciation it shares most similarity with other  accents in particular trudgill peter and jean hannah 2002 international english a guide to the varieties of standard english 4th ed london arnold isbn 0 340 80834 9 p 4  like most dialects of english it is distinguished primarily by its vowel  
the vowels of australian english can be divided according to length the long vowels which include s and s mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of  rp as well as its centring diphthongs the short vowels consisting only of monophthongs correspond to the rp lax vowels  there exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving australian english  which is unusual amongst the various dialects of english though not unknown elsewhere such as in regional south eastern dialects of the uk and eastern seaboard dialects in the us  as with general american and new zealand english the  is complete in australian english unstressed  sometimes written as  or  is merged into   unless it is followed by a velar consonant

australian english is  in other words the  sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant however a  can occur when a word that has a final r in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel an  may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have r in the spelling in certain environments namely after the long vowel  and after word final 
there is some degree of allophonic variation in the s as with north american english  is a feature of australian english prevocalic  and  surface as the   after s other than   m as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group for many speakers  and  in the combinations   and   are also palatalised thus   and   as australian  is only very slightly retroflex the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth in the same position as for  it is also somewhat rounded to say r the way australians do you need to say w at the same time where older english  and  have fallen together as  the  is complete in australian english
 occurs after          and   other cases of  and  along with  and  have  to    and  respectively for many speakers   is generally retained in other s
in common with  and  the phoneme  is pronounced as a dark velarised l in all positions unlike other dialects such as  and  where a light l ie a non velarised l is used in many positions
differences in stress weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between australian english and other forms of english which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility
the affixes  ary  ery  ory  bury  berry and  mony seen in words such as necessary mulberry and matrimony can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa although some words like necessary are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel older generations of australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel
words ending in unstressed  ile derived from latin adjectives ending in  ilis are pronounced with a full vowel  so that fertile rhymes with fur tile rather than turtle
in addition miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of english in relation to seemingly random words for example as with american english the vowel in yoghurt is pronounced as  long o rather than  short o and vitamin is pronounced with  long i in the first syllable rather than  short i as with british english advertisement is pronounced with  and buoy is pronounced as  rather than  two examples of miscellaneous pronunciations which contrast with both standard american and british usages are data which is pronounced with  dah as opposed to  day and maroon pronounced with  own as opposed to  oon
academic research has shown that the most notable variation within australian english is largely  this is mostly evident in phonology which is divided into three sociocultural varieties broad general and cultivated 
a limited range of s is strongly regional in nature consequently the geographical background of individuals can be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular australian states or territories and in some cases even smaller regions
in addition some australians speak  derived from australian english such as   and 
the broad general and cultivated accents form a continuum that lects minute variations in the australian accent they can lect the  education and urban or rural background of speakers though such indicators are not always reliablehttp  wwwinternationalmqeduau globe defaultaspxid 244ampeditionid 162 australias unique and evolving sound edition 34 2007 23 august 2007 – the macquarie globe  according to linguists the general australian variant emerged some time before 1900bruce moore australian oxford dictionary and felicity cox macquarie university interviewed in sounds of aus television documentary 2007 director david swann writer lawrie zion princess pictures broadcaster abc television  recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the broad variant along with the near extinction of the cultivated australian accent   the growth and dominance of general australian accents perhaps lects its prominence on radio and television during the late 20th century
 is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of australia and are said to vary along a continuum from forms close to standard australian english to more non standard forms there are distinctive features of accent grammar words and meanings as well as language use
the ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in australian english that are spoken by the  groups which are of non english speaking background  a massive immigration from asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the australian context  these ethnocultural varieties contain features of general australian english as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non english language features such as the  and 
although australian english is relatively homogeneous some regional variations are notable the dialects of english spoken in       and the  differ slightly from each other differences exist both in terms of vocabulary and phonology
most regional differences come down to word usage for example swimming clothes are known as cossies or swimmers in new south wales togs in queensland and bathers in victoria western australia and south australia  what is erred to as a stroller in most of australia is called a pusher in victoria and usually a pram in western australia name pauline bryant 1985pauline bryant 1985 regional variation in the australian english lexicon australian journal of linguistics 51 55 66  perence for synonymous words also differs between states for example garbage ie garbage bin garbage truck dominates over rubbish in new south wales and queensland while rubbish is more popular in victoria western australia and south australia name pauline bryant 1985  the word footy generally ers to the most popular  in the particular state or territory that is  in new south wales and queensland and  elsewhere beer glasses are also  in different states distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative eh also spelled ay or aye which is particularly associated with queensland
there are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words the extent to which the  has taken hold is one example this phonological development is more advanced in south australia which had a different settlement chronology and type than other parts of the country which resulted in a prolonged british english influence that outlasted that of the other colonies words such as dance advance plant graph example and answer are pronounced far more frequently with the older  as in mad outside of south australia but with  as in father within south australia name pauline bryant 1985   is also more common in south australia than other states  in western australian and queensland english the vowels in near and square are typically realised as centring diphthongs nee ya whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs  a feature common in victorian english is  whereby a victorian pronunciation of ellen may sound like alan to speakers from other states there is also regional variation in  before  as in school and pool typically pronounced as  in queensland and new south wales but  in south australia and western australia
australian english has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect and have been written on extensively with the  widely regarded as the national standard incorporating numerous australian termsthe macquarie dictionary fourth edition the macquarie library pty ltd 2005 
internationally well known examples of australian terminology include  meaning a remote sparsely populated area  meaning either a native forest or a country area in general and gday a greeting dinkum or fair dinkum means true or is that true among other things depending on context and inflectionhttp  wwwanueduau andc pubs ozwords november_98 indexhtml frederick ludowyk 1998 aussie words the dinkum oil on dinkum where does it come from 0zwords australian national dictionary centre access date 5 november 2007   the derivative dinky di means true or devoted a dinky di aussie is a true australian
 such as  as well as  such as  contain many historical australian words and phrases that are understood by australians even though some are not in common usage today
australian english in common with several british english dialects for example    and  uses the word  many words used by australians were at one time used in england but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there
for example creek in australia as in north america means a stream or small river whereas in the uk it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea paddock in australia means field whereas in the uk it means a small enclosure for livestock bush or scrub in australia as in north america means a wooded area whereas in england they are commonly used only in proper names such as  and 
 such as not bad not much and youre not wrong are also used as are s which are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity some common examples are arvo afternoon barbie barbecue  cigarette break aussie australian and pressie present gift this may also be done with peoples names to create s other english speaking countries create  for example gazza from gary or smitty from john smith the use of the suffix  o originates in irish gaelic irish ó which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in australian english
in informal speech incomplete comparisons are sometimes used such as sweet as as in that car is sweet as full fully or heaps may precede a word to act as an intensifier as in the waves at the beach were heaps good this was more common in regional australia and south australia but has been in common usage in urban australia for decades the suffix  ly is sometimes omitted in broader australian english for instance really good can become real good
australias switch to the  in the 1970s changed the countrys vocabulary of measurement from imperial towards metric measures 
where  australians sometimes favour a usage different from both varieties as with footpath for us sidewalk uk pavement capsicum for us bell pepper uk green red pepper or  for us comforter uk duvet in other instances it either shares a term with american english as with  uk lorry or  uk aubergine or with british english as with  us cell phone or  us hood
a non exhaustive selection of common british english terms not commonly used in australian english include australian usage in brackets artic articulated lorry semi trailer aubergine eggplant bank holiday public holiday bedsit one bedroom apartment bin lorry garbage rubbish truck cagoule raincoat candy floss fairy floss cash machine automatic teller machine atm child minder babysitter clingfilm glad wrap cling wrap courgette zucchini crisps chips potato chips doddle bludge dungarees overalls dustbin garbage rubbish bin dustcart garbage rubbish truck duvet doona elastoplast plaster band aid estate car station wagon fairy cake cupcake patty cake flannel face washer wash cloth free phone toll free football soccer high street main street hoover vacuum cleaner ice lolly ice block icy pole kitchen roll paper towel lavatory toilet lorry truck off licence bottle shop pavement footpath red green pepper capsicum pillar box mail box plimsoll sandshoe pushchair pram stroller saloon sedan sweets lollies utility room laundry wellington boots gumboots

terms shared by british and american english but not so commonly found in australian english include abroad overseas  ice box esky  ute  bushfire
australian english is particularly divergent from other varieties with respect to geographical terminology due to the countrys unique geography this is particularly true when comparing with british english due to that countrys dramatically different geography british geographical terms not in common use in australia include coppice cleared bushland dell valley fen swamp heath shrubland meadow grassy plain moor swampland spinney shrubland stream creek woods bush and village even the smallest settlements in australia are called towns or stations
in addition a number of words in australian english have different meanings to those ascribed in other varieties of english clothing related examples are notable pants in australian english er to british english trousers but in british english er to australian english underpants vest in australian english ers to british english waistcoat but in british english ers to australian english singlet thong in both american and british english ers to underwear otherwise known as a  while in australian english it ers to british and american english flip flop footwear there are numerous other examples including biscuit which ers in australian and british english to american english cookie or cracker but to a savoury cake in american english another notable example that has emerged due to immigration patterns is the use of the noun asian which in australian and american english commonly ers to people of n heritage british english oriental as opposed to british english in which it commonly ers to people of n descent
as with american english but unlike british english collective nouns are almost always singular in construction eg the government was unable to decide as opposed to the government were unable to decide
in common with british english the past tense and past participles of the verbs learn spell and smell are often irregular learnt spelt smelt
shant and the use of should as in i should be happy if common in upper register british english are almost never encountered in australian or north american english
while prepositions before days may be omitted in american english ie she resigned thursday they must be retained in australian english as in british english she resigned on thursday ranges of dates use to ie monday to friday as with british english rather than monday through friday in american english
river generally follows the name of the river in question as in north america ie darling river rather than the british convention of coming before the name eg river thames note in south australia however the british convention applies—for example the river murray or the river torrens
when saying or writing out numbers and is inserted before the tens and units ie one hundred and sixty two as with british practice however australians like americans are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1200 as twelve hundred rather than one thousand two hundred
as with american english on the weekend and studied medicine are used rather than the british at the weekend and read medicine

as in most english speaking countries there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar the  is used by some  and some other organisations as a standard for australian english spelling the style manual for authors editors and printers the cambridge guide to australian english usage and the australian guide to legal citation are prominent style guides
australian spelling is closer to  than  as with british spelling the u is retained in words such as colour honour labour and favour  while the macquarie dictionary lists the  our ending and follows it with the  or ending as an acceptable variant the latter is rarely found in actual use today australian print media including digital media today strongly favour  our endings a notable exception to this rule is the  which adopted the american spelling in 1912 as a result of  or spellings comparative popularity at that time consistent with british spellings  re rather than  er is the only listed variant in australian dictionaries in words such as theatre centre and manoeuvre unlike british english which is split between  ise and  ize in words such as organise and realise with  ize favoured by the  and  ise listed as a variant  ize is rare in australian english and designated as a variant by the macquarie dictionary ae and oe are often maintained in words such as manoeuvre paedophilia and foetus excepting those listed below however the macquarie dictionary lists forms with e eg pedophilia fetus as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within australian english towards using only e individual words where the perred spelling is listed by the macquarie dictionary as being different from the british spellings include program in all contexts as opposed to programme inquire and derivatives inquired inquiry etc as opposed to enquire and derivatives analog as opposed to digital as opposed to analogue livable as opposed to liveable guerilla as opposed to guerrilla yoghurt as opposed to yogurt verandah as opposed to veranda burqa as opposed to burka and pastie food as opposed to pasty name fourth edition 2005the macquarie dictionary fourth edition  the macquarie library pty ltd 2005  name macquariedictionarycomauhttp  wwwmacquariedictionarycomau  name oxforddictionariescomhttp  oxforddictionariescom  unspaced prepositions such as onto anytime alright and anymore are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts name fourth edition 2005the macquarie dictionary fourth edition  the macquarie library pty ltd 2005  name macquariedictionarycomau  name oxforddictionariescom

an ambush is a long established  in which  take advantage of concealment and the  to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions such as among dense  or behind tops ambushes have been used consistently throughout history from  to 
the use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game   
more recently an ambush often might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale such as over a  ambushes appear many times in  military history one outstanding example from ancient times is the  river hannibal encamped within striking distance of the romans with the trebia river between them and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment near the battle zone he had noticed says polybius a place between the two camps flat indeed and treeless but well adapted for an ambuscade as it was traversed by a water course with steep banks densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy 
when the roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear the result was slaughter and defeat for the romans nevertheless the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force although most of the legions were lost about 10000 romans cut their way through to safety maintaining  this ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a  is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation see ranger erence below
another famous ambush was that sprung by germanic warchief  against the romans at  this particular ambush was to have an impact on the course of western history the germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush they took cover in difficult forested terrain allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection they had the element of surprise and this was also aided by the defection of arminius from roman ranks prior to the battle they sprang the attack when the romans were most vulnerable when they had left their fortified camp and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm 
the germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly using a massive series of short rapid vicious charges against the length of the whole roman line with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place the germans also made use of blocking obstacles erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder roman movement along the route of the killing zone the result was mass slaughter of the romans and the destruction of 3 legions the germanic victory caused a limit on roman expansion in the west ultimately it established the rhine as the boundary of the roman empire for the next four hundred years until the decline of the roman influence in the west the roman empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer germania beyond the rhine
according to muslim tradition islamic prophet muhammad made use of ambush tactics in his military campaigns his first such use was during the  in the kharrar caravan raid sa`d ibn abi waqqas was ordered to lead a raid against the  his group consisted of about twenty muhajirs this raid was done about a month after the previous sad with his soldiers set up an ambush in the valley of  on the road to mecca and waited to raid a returning meccan caravan from syria but the caravan had already passed and the muslims returned to medina without any loot name mubarakpuri the sealed nectar p 127mubarakpuri the sealed nectar free version p 127  name haykal 1976 
arab tribes during muhammads era also made use of ambush tactics  one example retold in muslim tradition is said to have taken place during the  the banu thalabah tribe were already aware of the impending attack so they lay in wait for the muslims and when muhammad ibn maslama arrived at the sitethe banu thalabah with 100 men ambushed them while the muslims were making preparation to sleep and after a brief resistance killed all of muhammad ibn maslama’s men muhammad ibn maslama pretended to be dead a muslim who happened to pass that way found him and assisted him to return to  the raid was unsuccessful name mubarakpuri  
in modern warfare an ambush is most often employed by ground troops up to  size against enemy targets which may be other ground troops or possibly vehicles however in some situations especially when deep behind enemy lines the actual attack will be carried out by a platoon a  sized unit will be deployed to support the attack group setting up and maintaining a forward patrol harbour from which the attacking force will deploy and to which they will retire after the attack
ambushes are complex multi phase operations and are theore usually planned in some detail first a suitable killing zone is identified  this is the place where the ambush will be laid it is generally a place where enemy units are expected to pass and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment execution and extraction phases of the ambush patrol a path along a wooded valley floor would be a typical example
ambush can be described geometrically as
 linear when a number of firing units are equally distant from the linear 
 l shaped when a short leg of firing units are placed to  fire the length of the sides of the linear kill zone
 v shaped when the firing units are distant from the kill zone at the end where the enemy enters so the firing units lay down bands of intersecting and interlocking fire this ambush is normally triggered only when the enemy is well into the kill zone the intersecting bands of fire prevent any attempt of moving out of the kill zonehttp  wwwglobalsecurityorg military library policy army fm 7 85 ch6htm fm 7 85 chapter 6 special light infantry operations   bot generated title    
ambush criteria the terrain for the ambush had to meet strict criteria
 provide concealment to prevent detection from the ground or air
 enable ambush force to deploy encircle and divide the enemy
 allow for heavy weapons emplacements to provide sustained fire
 enable the ambush force to set up observation posts for early detection of the enemy
 permit the secret movement of troops to the ambush position and the dispersal of troops during withdrawal
one important feature of the ambush was that the target units should pile up after being attacked thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the  and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy the terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force or which offered some protection to the target was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre registered for mortars
ambush units the nva vc ambush formations consisted of
 lead blocking element
 main assault element
 rear blocking element
 observation posts
 command post
other elements might also be included if the situation demanded such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement
command posts when deploying into an ambush site the nva first occupied several observation posts placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using its strength and firepower as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander usually one main op and several secondary ops were established runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the ops and the main command post the ops were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options frequently the ops were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security the command post was situated in a central location often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site
recon methods recon elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300–500 meters away sometimes a leapfrogging recon technique was used surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other as the enemy drew close to the first it fell back behind the last recon team leaving an advance group in its place this one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap and the cycle rotated this method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points and allowed the recon groups to cover one another name rand corprand corp insurgent organization and operations a case study of the viet cong in the delta 1964–1966 santa monica august 1967

an abzyme from  and  also called catmab from catalytic monoclonal antibody and most often called catalytic antibody is a  with   abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptans but some natural abzymes can be found in normal humans anti vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies and in patients with  such as  where they can bind to and hydrolyze  to date abzymes display only weak modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical usehttp  courseschemindianaedu c582 documents hilvertabsreview_000pdf   they are however subjects of considerable academic interest  studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms enzyme structure and function catalysis and the immune system itself
enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state of a chemical reaction thereby enabling the formation of an otherwise less favorable molecular intermediate between the reactants and the products   if an antibody is developed to bind to a molecule thats structurally and electronically similar to the transition state of a given chemical reaction the developed antibody will bind to and stabilize the transition state just like a natural enzyme lowering the activation energy of the reaction and thus catalyzing the reaction by raising an antibody to bind to a stable transition state analog a new and unique type of enzyme is produced
so far all catalytic antibodies produced have displayed only modest weak catalytic activity the reasons for low catalytic activity for these molecules have been widely discussed possibilities indicate that factors beyond the binding site may play an important in particular through protein dynamics   some abzymes have been engineered to use metal ions and other s to improve their catalytic activityhttp  www2southeasternedu academics faculty dnorwood oldseminars spring04 seminarnicholaspdf http  wwwhighbeamcom doc 1g1 9343909html 
the possibility of catalyzing a reaction by means of an antibody which binds the transition state was first suggested by  in 1969http  wwwdschunivtriesteit ~benedetti antibody_catalysishtm   in 1994  and  received the prestigious  for developing catalytic antibodies for many reactions and popularizing their study into a significant sub field of enzymologyhttp  www2lblgov science articles archive peter schultz wolf prizehtml 
in a june 2008 issue of the journal autoimmunity review  name physorg  researchers s planque sudhir paul phd and yasuhiro nishiyama phd of the university of texas medical school at houston announced that they have engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the   binding site this is the one part of the   outer coating that does not change because it is the attachment point to  the key cell in cell mediated immunity once infected by hiv patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat  the antibodies are ineffective because of the virus ability to change their coats rapidly because this protein gp120 is necessary for hiv to attach it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the hiv variant population
the abzyme does more than bind to the site it catalytically destroys the site rendering the virus inert and then can attack other hiv viruses a single abzyme molecule can destroy thousands of hiv viruses

in  adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly into a multitude of new forms particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available creates new challenges or opens new environmental niches  name schluter2000  starting with a recent single ancestor this process results in the  and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits with which they can exploit a range of divergent environments name schluter2000

much research has been done on adaptive radiation due to its dramatic effects on the diversity of a population  however more research is needed especially to fully understand the many factors affecting adaptive radiation  both empirical and theoretical approaches are helpful though each has its disadvantages  in order to procure the largest amount of data empirical and theoretical approaches must be unitedgavrilets s amp losos j b 2009 adaptive radiation contrasting theory with

four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation name schluter2000  
# a common ancestry of component species specifically a recent ancestry note that this is not the same as a  in which all descendants of a common ancestor are included
# a phenotype environment correlation a significant association between environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to exploit those environments
# trait utility the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in their corresponding environments
# rapid speciation presence of one or more bursts in the emergence of new species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is underway
the evolution of a novel feature may permit a clade to diversify by making new areas of morphospace accessible a classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth this trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on evolution of this character has thus increased the number of s available to mammals the trait arose a number of times in different groups during the  and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation name jernvall1996  birds find other ways to provide for each other ie the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore initiating an adaptive radiation 
other examples include  gestation for n mammals or  in  name levin 21  
adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain the colonizing population may diversify rapidly taking advantage of all possible niches
in  an isolated lake which formed recently in the african rift valley over 300 species of  fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15000 years
adaptive radiations commonly follow s following an extinction many niches are left vacant a classic example of this is the replacement of the non avian dinosaurs with mammals at the  and of s by bivalves at the 
one famous example where adaptive radiation is seen is with   it has been observed by many evolutionary biologists that fragmented landscapes oftentimes are a prime location for adaptive radiation to occur  the differences in geography throughout disjointed landscapes such as islands are believed to promote such diversification  darwin’s finches occupy the fragmented landscape of the galapagos islands and are diversified into many different species which differ in ecology song and morphology specifically the size and shapes of their beaks  the first obvious explanation for these differences is allopatric speciation speciation that occurs when populations of the same species become isolated geographically and evolve separately  because the finches are divided amongst the islands the birds have been evolving separately for several million years  however this does not account for the fact that many of the species occur in sympatry with seven or more species inhabiting the same island name petren k 2005petren k grant p r grant b r amp keller l f 2005 comparative landscape genetics and the adaptive radiation of darwins finches the role of peripheral isolation molecular ecology 1410 2943 2957   this raises the question as to why these species split when living in the same environment with all the same resources  petren grant grant and keller proposed that the speciation of the finches occurred in two parts an initial easily observable allopatric event followed by a less clear sympatric event this sympatric event which occurred second was adaptive radiation name petren k 2005   this occurred largely to promote specialization upon each island  one major morphological difference among species sharing one island is beak size and shape  adaptive radiation led to the evolution of different beaks which could access different food and resources  those with short beaks are better adapted to eating seeds on the ground those with thin sharp beaks eat insects and those with long beaks use their beaks to probe for food inside cacti  with these specializations seven or more species of finches are able to inhabit the same environments without competition or lack of resources killing several off  in other words these morphological differences in beak size and shape brought about by adaptive radiation allow the island diversification to persist
another famous example is the  fishes in lakes of the east african rift  the lakes in this area are believed to support and sustain about 2000 different species of these fish each with different ecological and morphological characteristics such as body sizelosos jonathan b adaptive radiation ecological opportunity and evolutionary determinism the american naturalist 1756 2010 623 39 web 28 oct 2014   like the galapagos islands these lakes form a fragmented landscape that isolates the cichlid fish from one another allowing them and many of the organisms they live with to evolve separately  the diversity of the lakes is in fact quite extraordinary because the adaptive radiations here are sometimes so young  one thing that has interested scientists about the cichlid fish case is the possibility of convergent evolution or the evolution of analogous structures independently driven by similar environmental selection pressures  however quantitative studies on the convergent evolution of the cichlid fish are limitedlosos jonathan b adaptive radiation ecological opportunity and evolutionary determinism the american naturalist 1756 2010 623 39 web 28 oct 2014 
another example of an adaptive radiation would be an  species of the hawaiian islands  the s are a large highly diverse species which have been part of a vast adaptive radiation that began as the hawaiian islands started to form  the honeycreeper species was shaped by island formation and natural selection  the mechanism by which this adaptive radiation occurred can be described as  via the peripheral isolate model  each time a new island formed a dispersal event would occur which would result in new community structures on each island new selection pressures forced the adaptive radiation of the hawaiian honeycreepers as they needed to exploit new resources from the different environments of each island   it has been determined that many of the similar morphologies and behaviors of the hawaiian honeycreepers located on distant islands are due to convergence of analogous traits caused by similar environments 
though the most famously recognized cases of adaptive radiation have occurred in animals such as darwin’s finches or the cichlid fish adaptive radiation certainly occurs in plant species as well  the most famous example of adaptive radiation in plants is quite possibly the hawaiian silverswords  the hawaiian  consists of twenty eight species of hawaiian plants which range from trees to shrubs to vines  this is exceptional diversification as can be seen through the significant morphological differences between each species of the hawaiian silverswordsbaldwin bruce g and michael j sanderson age and rate of diversification of the hawaiian silversword alliance compositae proceedings of the national academy of sciences 9516 1998 9402 9406   with some species it’s virtually impossible to distinguish visually that they were ever part of one species to begin with these radiations occurred millions of years ago but through studies over the past few decades it has been suggested that the rate of speciation and diversification was extremely high  these high rates as well as the fragmented landscape of the hawaiian islands are key characteristics which point directly to adaptive radiation
 lizards have been radiating widely in many different environments including central and south america as well as the west indies and experience great diversity of species just as the finches cichlid fish and silverswords  studies have been done to determine whether radiations occur similarly for these lizards on the mainland as they do on the caribbean islands or if differences can be observed in how they speciated  it has been observed that in fact the radiations are very different and ecological and morphological characteristics that these lizards developed as part of their speciation on the islands and on the mainland are uniqueirschick duncan j et al a comparison of evolutionary radiations in mainland and caribbean anolis lizards ecology 787 1997 2191 2203   they have clearly evolved differently to the environments they inhabit  the environmental pressures on the anolis lizards are not the same on the mainland as they are on the islands  there is a significantly larger amount of predators preying on the anolis lizards on the mainland  this is but one environmental difference  other factors play a role in what sort of adaptive radiation will develop  among the caribbean islands a larger perch diameter correlates with longer forelimbs larger body mass longer tails and longer hind limbs  however on the mainland a larger perch diameter correlates with shorter tails  this shows that these lizards adapted differently to their environment depending on whether they were located on the mainland or the islands  these differing characteristics reconfirm that most of the adaptive radiation between the mainland and the islands occurred independently  on the islands specifically species have adapted to certain “microhabitats” in which they require different morphological traits to survive  irschick 1997 divides these microhabitats into six groups “trunk–ground trunk–crown grass–bush crown–giant twig and trunk”  different groups of lizards would acquire traits for one of these particular areas that made them more specialized for survival in this microhabitat and not so much in others  adaptive radiation allows species to acquire the traits they need to survive in these microhabitats and reduce competition to allow the survival of a greater number of organisms as seen in many of the examples before

agarose gel electrophoresis is a method of  used in   genetics and clinical chemistry to separate a mixed population of dna or proteins in a matrix of  the proteins may be separated by charge and or size  agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent and the  and  fragments by length  biomolecules are separated by applying an  to move the charged molecules through an  matrix and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrixsambrook j russel dw 2001 molecular cloning a laboratory manual 3rd ed cold spring harbor laboratory press cold spring harbor ny 
agarose gels are easy to cast and are particularly suitable for separating dna of size range most often encountered in laboratories which accounts for the popularity of its use the separated dna may be viewed with stain most commonly under uv light and the dna fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease most agarose gels used are between 07   2% dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer
agarose gel is a three dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass  the 3 d structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can theore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state the melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature depending on the sources agarose gel has a gelling temperature of 35 42ampnbsp°c and a melting temperature of 85 95ampnbsp°c low melting and low gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available
agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength that made it particularly suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of dna and large protein molecules the pore size of a 1% gel has been estimated from 100ampnbspnm to 200 500ampnbspnm name zimm  name viovy  and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as 015% to form a slab for gel electrophoresis name serwer  low concentration gels 01   02% however are fragile and theore hard to handle agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for dna but has a greater range of separation and is theore used for dna fragments of usually 50 20000 bp in size the limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb but resolution of over 6 mb is possible with  pfge  it can also be used to separate large proteins and it is the perred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than 5 10ampnbspnm a 09% agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of  name serwer 
the agarose polymer contains charged groups in particular  and  name lonza   these negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of dna in a process called  eeo and can theore retard the movement of dna and cause blurring of bands higher concentration gel would have higher electroosmotic flow low eeo agarose is theore generally perred for use in agarose  but high eeo agarose may be used for other purposes the lower sulphate content of low eeo agarose particularly low melting point lmp agarose is also beneficial in cases where the dna extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures such as  and   zero eeo agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged group and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions 
a number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids the dimension of the gel pores gel concentration size of dna being electrophoresed the voltage used the ionic strength of the buffer and the concentration of intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis 
smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules in gel and double stranded dna moves at a rate that is inversely proportional to the logsub10 sub of the number of base pairs this relationship however breaks down with very large dna fragments and separation of very large dna fragments requires the use of  pfge
for standard agarose gel electrophoresis larger molecules are resolved better using a low concentration gel while smaller molecules separate better at high concentration gel high concentrations gel however requires longer run times sometimes days
the movement of the dna may be affected by the  of the dna molecule for example  usually moves faster than relaxed dna because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact in a normal plasmid dna preparation multiple forms of dna may be present  gel electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show the negatively supercoiled form as the main band while nicked dna open circular form and the relaxed closed circular form appears as minor bands the rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions name sambrook1  and the mobility of larger circular dna may be more strongly affected than linear dna by the pore size of the gel 
ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular dna can change the charge length as well as the superhelicity of the dna molecule theore its presence in gel during electrophoresis can affect its movement agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular dna with different supercoiling topology 
dna damage due to increased ing will also reduce electrophoretic dna migration in a dose dependent way  
the rate of migration of the dna is proportional to the voltage applied ie the higher the voltage the faster the dna moves the resolution of large dna fragments however is lower at high voltage the mobility of dna may also change in an unsteady field   in a field that is periodically reversed the mobility of dna of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency name zimm   this phenomenon can result in band inversion in field inversion gel electrophoresis fige whereby larger dna fragments move faster than smaller ones
 smiley gels   this edge effect is caused when the voltage applied is too high for the gel concentration used  
 overloading of dna   overloading of dna slows down the migration of dna fragments
 contamination   presence of impurities such as salts or proteins can affect the movement of the dna
the negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the dna towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis however the migration of dna molecules in solution in the absence of a gel matrix is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis name zimm  name old amp primrose   the gel matrix is theore responsible for the separation of dna by size during electrophoresis and a number of models exist to explain the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix a widely accepted one is the ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve a globular protein or a  dna moves through the interconnected pores and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix and the molecules of different sizes can theore be separated in this sieving process name zimm  
the ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule for dna molecules of size greater than 1 kb a  model or its variants is most commonly used this model assumes that the dna can crawl in a snake like fashion hence reptation through the pores as an elongated molecule a biased reptation model applies at higher electric field strength whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction and pulls the rest of the molecule along name microfluidics   real time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules however showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis with the dna showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball or becoming hooked into a u shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres  
the details of an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment may vary depending on methods but most follow a general procedure
the gel is prepared by dissolving the agarose powder in an appropriate buffer such as tae or tbe to be used in electrophoresis   the agarose is dispersed in the buffer before heating it to near boiling point but avoid boiling the melted agarose is allowed to cool sufficiently before pouring the solution into a cast as the cast may warp or crack if the agarose solution is too hot a comb is placed in the cast to create wells for loading sample and the gel should be completely set before use
the concentration of gel affects the resolution of dna separation for a standard agarose gel electrophoresis a 08% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb dna fragments while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 02–1kb fragments 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis   the concentration is measured in weight of agarose over volume of buffer used g ml high percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly while low percentage gels 01 02% are fragile and not easy to handle low melting point lmp agarose gels are also more fragile than normal agarose gel  low melting point agarose may be used on its own or simultaneously with standard agarose for the separation and isolation of dna  pfge and fige are often done with high percentage agarose gels
once the gel has set the comb is removed leaving wells where dna samples can be loaded loading buffer is mixed with the dna sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells the loading buffer contains a dense compound which may be glycerol sucrose or  that raises the density of the sample so that the dna sample may sink to the bottom of the well if the dna sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation it may float out of the well the loading buffer also include colored dyes such as  and  used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis the dna samples are loaded using a 
agarose gel electrophoresis is most commonly done horizontally in a submarine mode whereby the slab gel is completely submerged in buffer during electrophoresis it is also possible but less common to perform the electrophoresis vertically as well as horizontally with the gel raised on agarose legs using an appropriate apparatus   the buffer used in the gel is the same as the running buffer in the electrophoresis tank which is why electrophoresis in the submarine mode is possible with agarose gel
for optimal resolution of dna greater than 2kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis 5 to 8 v cm is recommended the distance in cm ers to the distance between electrodes theore this recommended voltage would be 5 to 8 multiplied by the distance between the electrodes in cm name sambrook1    voltage may also be limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if it is run at high voltage for a prolonged period especially if the gel used is lmp agarose gel too high a voltage may also reduce resolution as well as causing band streaking for large dna molecules too low a voltage may lead to broadening of band for small dna fragments due to dispersion and diffusion 
since dna is not visible in natural light the progress of the electrophoresis is monitored using colored dyes xylene cyanol light blue color comigrates large dna fragments while bromophenol blue dark blue comigrates with the smaller fragments less commonly used dyes include  and  which migrate ahead of bromophenol blue a  is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the dna fragments note however that the size of a circular dna like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by  alternatively a supercoiled dna marker may be used
dna as well as rna are normally visualized by staining with  which intercalates into the major grooves of the dna and fluoresces under uv light the ethidium bromide may be added to the agarose solution before it gels or the dna gel may be stained later after electrophoresis destaining of the gel is not necessary but may produce better images other methods of staining are available examples are      sulphate and   sybr green gelred and other similar commercial products are sold as safer alternatives to ethidium bromide as it has been shown to be  in  although the  of ethidium bromide has not actually been established sybr green requires the use of a blue light transilluminator dna stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a uv transilluminator which is an advantage however it may not produce a strong band
when stained with ethidium bromide the gel is viewed with an  uv transilluminator standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302 312 nm uv b however exposure of dna to uv radiation for as little as 45 seconds can produce damage to dna and affect subsequent procedures for example reducing the efficiency of  in vitro  and    exposure of the dna to uv radiation theore should be limited using a higher wavelength of 365ampnbspnm uv a range causes less damage to the dna but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images while the longer wavelength should be used when it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time
the transilluminator apparatus may also contain image capture devices such as a digital or polaroid camera that allow an image of the gel to be taken or printed
the separated dna bands are often used for further procedures and a dna band may be cut out of the gel as a slice dissolved and purified the gels may also be used for blotting techniques
in general the ideal buffer should have good conductivity produce less heat and have a long life  there are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis common ones for nucleic acids include  tae and  tbe many other buffers have been proposed eg  lb which is almost never used based on pubmed citations iso electric histidine pk matched goods buffers etc in most cases the purported rationale is lower current less heat and or matched ion mobilities which leads to longer buffer life tris phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if dna extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction borate is problematic borate can polymerize and or interact with cis diols such as those found in rna tae has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger dna this means a lower voltage and more time but a better product lb is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp however with its low conductivity a much higher voltage could be used up to 35 v cm which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis as low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium 1 mm lithium boratebrody jr kern se 2004 history and principles of conductive media for standard dna electrophoresis anal biochem 33311 13 pmid 15351274 http  wwwccahschulaacth molmed dna%20electro%27s%20conductive%20mediapdf pdf   the buffers used contain edta to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function

agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis samples are also easily recovered after the experiment is finished the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a rigerator
electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce ph changes due to the electric field which is important because the charge of dna and rna depends on ph but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution further different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other for morphological or other reasons

an allele  or  or allel is one of a number of alternative forms of the same  or same  name collins  name basic glossary on genetic epidemiology  sometimes different alleles can result in different observable s such as different  however most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation
most s have two sets of s that is they are   these chromosomes are erred to as s diploid organisms have one copy of each  and theore one allele on each chromosome if both alleles are the same they and the organism are  with respect to that gene if the alleles are different they and the organism are  with respect to that gene
the word allele is a short form of allelomorph other form which was used in the early days of  to describe variant forms of a  detected as different  it derives from the greek pix ἀλλήλ allel meaning reciprocal or each other which itself is related to the greek adjective ἄλλος allos cognate with latin alius meaning other
in many cases genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as  or  according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the heterozygote most resembles where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes the allele involved is said to be  to the other which is said to be  to the former name essential genetics a genomics perspective  the degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci this type of interaction was first formally described by  however many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by  and 
the term  allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in wild populations of organisms such as fruit flies  such a wild type allele was historically regarded as dominant common and normal in contrast to  alleles regarded as recessive rare and frequently deleterious it was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the wild type allele at most gene loci and that any alternative mutant allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of affected individuals often as  and more frequently in heterozygous form in  for the mutant allele it is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic with multiple alleles whose frequencies vary from population to population and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences
a population or  of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each  among various individuals allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles  present or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population a  is a gene variant that lacks the genes normal function because it either is not expressed or the expressed protein is inactive
for example at the gene locus for the    s in humans name  name onlinemendelianinheritanceinman  classical genetics recognizes three alleles isupa sup isupb sup and i that determine compatibility of s any individual has one of six possible s isupa supisupa sup isupa supi isupb supisupb sup isupb supi isupa supisupb sup and ii that produce one of four possible s type a produced by isupa supisupa sup homozygous and isupa supi heterozygous genotypes type b produced by isupb supisupb sup homozygous and isupb supi heterozygous genotypes type ab produced by isupa supisupb sup heterozygous genotype and type o produced by ii homozygous genotype it is now known that each of the a b and o alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different dna sequences that produce proteins with identical properties more than 70 alleles are known at the abo locus name sequence variation at the human abo locus  an individual with type a blood may be an ao heterozygote an aa homozygote or an aa heterozygote with two different a alleles
the frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes see  for a simple model with two alleles
 mathp + q 1 \  math
 mathp^2 + 2pq + q^2 1 \ math
where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the alternative allele which necessarily sum to unity then psup2 sup is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele 2pq is the fraction of heterozygotes and qsup2 sup is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele if the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is psup2 sup + 2pq and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is qsup2 sup
with three alleles
 mathp + q + r   1 \  math and
 mathp^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr   1 \ math
in the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus the number of possible genotypes g with a number of alleles a is given by the expression
 mathg  \frac{aa+1}{2}  math
a number of  are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single gene trait recessive genetic disorders include     pku and  other disorders are also due to recessive alleles but because the gene locus is located on the x chromosome so that males have only one copy that is they are  they are more frequent in males than in females examples include red green  and 
other disorders such as  occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele

   definition amp symptoms  
antimicrobial resistance amr is when  are less treatable with one or more  medications used to treat or prevent  name who2014  there are three main ways by which resistance can occur by natural resistance in certain types of bacteria by genetic  or by one species acquiring resistance from another  resistance can happen spontaneously owing to random mutations to a buildup of resistance over time or to  name about antimicrobial resistance  although the latter two pathways are the most important resistant microbes become increasingly difficult to treat requiring alternative medications or higher doses both of which may be more costly or  microbes which are resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called  mdr in the press these organisms are often erred to as superbugs name cdcgetsmart  antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly problematic issue that leads to millions of deaths every year name who 2014  a few infections become completely untreatable due to resistance all classes of microbes develop resistance fungi  resistance es  resistance   resistance   resistance of those categories bacterial antibiotic resistance poses the largest threat to 
   prevention   
antibiotics should only be used when needed and only when prescribed by health professionals name swedish  when antibiotics are being prescribed the prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration the right patient the right drug the right dose the right route and the right time  narrow spectrum antibiotics should be used rather than broad spectrum antibiotics when possible to effectively and accurately target specific organisms name nps2013  cultures should be taken before treatment when indicated and treatment potentially changed based on the susceptibility report name cdc mission   for people who will be self administering these medications in the home setting emphasis must be placed on education about proper use of the drug in practice health care providers should try to minimize spread of resistant infections by using proper sanitations techniques including  or disinfecting between each patient and should encourage the same of the patient visitors and family members name cdc mission 
   epidemiology  
the rising trend in drug resistance can be attributed to three primary areas use of antibiotics in the human population use of antibiotics in the animal population and the spread of resistant strains between human or non human sources name about antimicrobial resistance  any use of antibiotics can increase  in a population of bacteria causing vulnerable bacteria to die thereby increasing the relative numbers of resistant bacteria and allowing for further growth as resistance to antibiotics becomes more common there is greater need for alternative treatments call for new antibiotic therapies have been issued but there is continuing decline in the number of  approved drugs  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has developed a monitoring program for the top 18 drug resistant threats in the united states categorized by level of concern examples of common types of drug resistant bacteria include  mrsa  vrsa  esbl  vre  mrab

a  who report released april 2014 stated this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone of any age in any country antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health name whointhttp  wwwwhoint mediacentre news releases 2014 amr report en  whos first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious worldwide threat to public health retrieved 2014 05 02  there have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat including a proposal for an  on antimicrobial resistance  antibiotic resistance is not properly mapped across the world but the countries that are affected the most are poorer countries with already weaker healthcare systems name swedish 
the who defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganisms resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism name who2014 
a person cannot become resistant to antibiotics resistance is a property of the microbe not a person or other organism infected by a microbe 
bacteria with resistance to antibiotics predate medical use of antibiotics by humans  however widespread antibiotic use has made more bacteria resistant through the process of  
reasons for the widespread use of antibiotics include
increasing global availability over time since the 1950s
uncontrolled sale in many low or middle income countries where they can be obtained over the counter without a prescription potentially resulting in antibiotics being used when not indicated name lid13the lancet infectious diseases commission http  wwwprincetonedu pei news s1473309913703189 mainpdf antibiotic resistance—the need for global solutions lancet infect dis 201313 1057–98  this may result in emergence of resistance in any remaining  bacteria
 feed at low doses for growth promotion is an accepted practice in many industrialized countries and is known to lead to increased levels of resistance  name mathew  releasing large quantities of antibiotics into the environment during pharmaceutical manufacturing through inadequate wastewater treatment increases the risk that antibiotic resistant strains will develop and spread   it is uncertain whether antibacterials in soaps and other products contribute to antibiotic resistance but they are discouraged for other reasons  
increasing bacterial resistance is linked with the volume of antibiotic prescribed as well as missing doses when taking antibiotics name pechère jc 2001 s170–3  inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has been attributed to a number of causes including people insisting on antibiotics physicians prescribing them as they feel they do not have time to explain why they are not necessary and physicians not knowing when to prescribe antibiotics or being overly cautious for medical and or legal reasons name arn2005 
up to half of antibiotics used in humans are unnecessary and inappropriate name about antimicrobial resistance  for example a third of people believe that antibiotics are effective for the   and the common cold is the most common reason antibiotics are prescribed  even though antibiotics are useless against viruses a single regimen of antibiotics even in compliant individuals leads to a greater risk of resistant organisms to that antibiotic in the person for a month to possibly a year  
antibiotic resistance increases with duration of treatment theore as long as an effective minimum is kept shorter courses of antibiotics are likely to decrease rates of resistance reduce cost and have better outcomes with fewer complications name nps2013  short course regimens exist for     suspected lung infections in intense care wards  so called   middle ear infections sinusitis and throat infections  and penetrating gut injuries   in some situations a short course may not cure the infection as well as a long course  a  editorial recommended that antibiotics can often be safely stopped 72ampnbsphours after symptoms resolve  because individuals may feel better before the infection is eradicated doctors must provide instructions to them so they know when it is safe to stop taking a prescription some researchers advocate doctors using a very short course of antibiotics reevaluating the patient after a few days and stopping treatment if there are no clinical signs of infectionmarc bonten md eijkman winkler institute for medical microbiology utrecht the netherland   http  hicsigwikiasidnetau images 4 41 should_you_stop_an_antibiotic_course_early_if_you_feel_better_r_evertspdf infectious diseases and inflammation 
certain  result in resistance more than others increased rates of mrsa infections are seen when using  s and    cephalosporins and particularly quinolones and  are more likely to produce colonisation with   
factors within the intensive care unit setting such as mechanical ventilation and multiple underlying diseases also appear to contribute to bacterial resistance  poor hand hygiene by hospital staff has been associated with the spread of resistant organisms  and an increase in hand washing compliance results in decreased rates 
improper use of antibiotics can often be attributed to the presence of  in particular regions socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy the efficacy of treatment programs for drug resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violencefarmer paul e bruce nizeye sara stulac and salmaan keshavjee 2006 structural violence and clinical medicine plos medicine 1686–1691 url  
the  concluded that inappropriate use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is an underlying contributor to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant germs and that the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited the  has added to the terrestrial animal health code a series of guidelines with recommendations to its members for the creation and harmonization of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programs  monitoring of the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry  and recommendations to ensure the proper and prudent use of antibiotic substances another guideline is to implement methodologies that help to establish associated risk factors and assess the risk of antibiotic resistance 
eighty percent of antibiotics sold in the united states are used on livestock the majority of these antibiotics are given to animals that are otherwise healthy rather it is normal practice to mix antibiotics with livestock food to promote healthier living conditions and to encourage animal growth  the use of antibiotics in animals is to a large degree involved in the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganismshttp  wwwncbinlmnihgov books nbk97126  the resistance phenomenon in microbes and infectious disease vectors implications for human health and strategies for containment workshop summary institute of medicine us forum on emerging infections knobler sl lemon sm najafi m et al editors washington dc national academies press us 2003  antibiotics are used in food with the intention of not only preventing controlling and treating diseases but also to promote growth name about antimicrobial resistance  antibiotic use in animals can be classified into therapeutic prophylactic metaphylactic and growth promotion uses of antibiotics   all four patterns select for bacterial resistance since antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process but the non therapeutic uses expose larger number of animals and theore of bacteria for more extended periods and at lower doses they theore greatly increase the cross section for the evolution of resistance
  since the last third of the 20th century antibiotics have been used extensively  in  in 2013 80% of antibiotics used in the us were used in animals and only 20% in humans in 1997 half were used in humans and half in animals name therealnews 2014 05 18  some antibiotics are not used and not considered significant for use in humans because they either lack efficacy or purpose in humans such as s in ruminants  or because the drug has gone out of use in humans others are used in both animals and humans including penicillin and some forms of tetracyclinethe editorial board of the  may 10 2014 http  wwwnytimescom 2014 05 11 opinion sunday the rise of antibiotic resistancehtml opinionamp_r 0 the rise of antibiotic resistance  historically regulation of antibiotic use in food animals has been limited to limiting drug residues in meat egg and milk products rather than by direct concern over the development of antibiotic resistance this mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine where in general researchers and doctors were more concerned about effective but non toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance
in 2001 the  estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the us are given to food animals for example chickens pigs and cattle in the absence of disease name therealnews 2014 05 18   the amounts given are termed sub therapeutic ie insufficient to combat disease despite no diagnosis of disease the administration of these drugs most of which are not significant to human medicine results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated it is theorized that sub therapeutic dosages kills some but not all of the bacterial organisms in the animal — likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic resistanthttp  wwwncbinlmnihgov books nbk114485  antibiotic resistance   linking human and animal health improving food safety through a one health approach workshop summary wegener henrik c washington dc national academies press us 2012  studies have shown however that in essence the overall population levels of bacteria are unchanged only the mix of bacteria is affected the actual mechanism by which sub therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promoters is thus unclear some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub clinical infections which would be cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed thereby allowing the creatures to thrive no convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory and the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives the mechanism of growth promotion is theore probably something other than killing off the bad bugs
antibiotics are used in us animal feed to promote animal productivity name mathew   in particular poultry feed and water is a common route of administration of drugs due to higher overall costs when drugs are administered by handling animals individually
in research studies occasional animal to human spread of antibiotic resistant organisms has been demonstrated resistant bacteria can be transmitted from animals to humans in three ways by consuming s milk meat eggs etc from close or direct contact with animals or other humans or through the environment  in the first pathway  methods can help eliminate decrease or prevent the growth of bacteria in some food classes evidence for the transfer of macrolide resistant microorganisms from animals to humans has been scant and most evidence shows that pathogens of concern in human populations originated in humans and are maintained there with rare cases of transference to humans name pmid15151237  name pmid18643826 
naturally occurring antibiotic resistance is common name wright10  genes for resistance to antibiotics like antibiotics themselves are ancient the genes that confer resistance are known as the environmental  name wright10  these genes may be transferred from non disease causing bacteria to those that do cause disease leading to clinically significant antibiotic resistance name wright10  in 1952 it was shown that penicillin resistant bacteria existed before penicillin treatment  and also preexistent bacterial resistance to richard william nelson darwin then and now the most amazing story in the history of science iuniverse 2009 p 294  in 1962 the presence of  was detected in dormant s of  revived from dried soil on the roots of plants preserved since 1689 in the wayne w umbreit advances in applied microbiology vol 11 academic press 1970 p 80  name pmid4963324  name penicillinase jun 8 1972 p 546  six  of  found in the bowels of william braine and john hartnell members of the  showed resistance to  and  name ns feb 11 1989 p 34  penicillinase may have emerged as a defense mechanism for bacteria in their s such as the case of penicillinase rich  living with penicillin producing  however this may be circumstantial name penicillinase  search for a penicillinase ancestor has focused on the class of s that must be a priori capable of specific combination with pollock p 77  the resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin in turn was attributed to braines and hartnells contact with microorganisms that naturally produce them or  in the  of clostridium strains name ns  there is evidence that  and other pollutants may select for antibiotic resistant bacteria generating a constant source of them in small numbers 
antibiotic resistance is a growing problem among humans and wildlife in terrestrial or aquatic environments in this respect the spread and contamination of the environment especially through hot spots such as hospital wastewater and untreated urban wastewater is a growing and serious public health problem  antibiotics have been polluting the environment since their introduction through human waste medication farming animals and the pharmaceutical industry name martinez j l 2012 pp 151  171martinez j l amp olivares j 2012 envrironmental pollution by antibiotic resistance genes in p l keen amp m h montforts antimicrobial resistance in the environment pp 151  171 hoboken nj john wiley amp sons  along with antibiotic waste resistant bacteria follow thus introducing antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment as bacteria replicate quickly the resistant bacteria that enter the environment replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide in addition bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer theore even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment antibiotic resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure name martinez j l 2012 pp 151  171

excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance since the beginning of the antibiotic era antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease name andersson2011  overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance the main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses including viral infections like the common cold in an analysis of drug prescriptions 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection both viral in origin were given prescriptions for antibiotics name gilberg2003  these prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria
in a recent years  teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal use of antimicrobials  the goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance
there have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur a system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance
on march 27 2015 the white house released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria the task force for combating antibiotic resistant bacteria developed the national action plan for combating antibiotic resistant bacteria with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the us in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives this plan outlines steps taken by the federal government over the next give years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic resistant infections maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market and to help to develop future diagnostics antibiotics and vaccines name whitehousegov 
the action plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care public health veterinary medicine agriculture food safety and research and manufacturing these goals as listed by the white house are as follows 
 slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections
 strengthen national one health surveillance efforts to combat resistance
 advance development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria
 accelerate basic and applied research and development for new antibiotics other therapeutics and vaccines
 improve international collaboration and capacities for antibiotic resistance prevention surveillance control and antibiotic research and development
by following are goals set to meet by 2020 name whitehousegov 
 establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
 reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
 establishment of state antibiotic resistance ar prevention programs in all 50 states 
 elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food producing animals
the world health organization has promoted the first world antibiotic awareness week running from 16–22 november 2015 the aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance it also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance 
 
microorganisms do not develop resistance to s because a vaccine enhances the bodys immune system whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the bodys normal defenses furthermore if the use of vaccines increase there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs  however new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may  for example an updated  is needed each year
while theoretically promising antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy because of immunological variation between staphylococcus species and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway 
 
alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration

growing us consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to greater availability of antibiotic free animal products  for example chicken producer perdue removed all human antibiotics from its feed and launched products labeled “antibiotic free” under the harvestland brand in 2007 consumer response was positive and in 2014 perdue also phased out ionophores from its hatchery and began using the “antibiotic free” labels on its harvestland simply smart and perfect portions products 
the four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are
#drug inactivation or modification for example enzymatic deactivation of  in some penicillin resistant bacteria through the production of  most commonly the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis name criswell daniel 2004criswell daniel the evolution of antibiotic resistance institute for creation research np 2004 web 28 oct 2014 
#alteration of target site for example alteration of —the binding target site of penicillins—in  and other penicillin resistant bacteria another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins these proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis the mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell which in turn changes its conformational shape this allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis 
#alteration of metabolic pathway for example some  resistant bacteria do not require  paba an important precursor for the synthesis of  and  in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides instead like mammalian cells they turn to using pormed folic acid
#reduced drug accumulation by decreasing drug  or increasing active  pumping out of the drugs across the cell surface  these specialized pumps can be found within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species and are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage these efflux pumps are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibioticri aminov ri mackie evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance genes microbiology letters 8 may 2007

  and also of unlinked point mutations in the   at a rate of about 1 in 10sup8 sup per chromosomal replication mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant a mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether research has shown the bacterial protein lexa may play a key role in the acquisition of bacterial mutations giving resistance to quinolones and rifampicin dna damage induces the sos gene repressor lexa to undergo autoproteolytic activity this includes the transcription of genes encoding pol ii pol iv and pol v which are three nonessential dna polymerases that are required for mutation in response to dna damage  the antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce they then pass this trait to their offspring which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony although these chromosomal mutations may seem to benefit the bacteria by providing antibiotic resistance they also confer a cost of fitness for example a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but it will also slow the process of protein synthesis name criswell daniel 2004  additionally a particular study specifically compared the overall fitness of antibiotic resistant strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium to their drug sensitive revertants they observed a reduced overall fitness in the antibiotic resistant strains especially in growth ratebr levin v perrot nina walker compensatory mutations antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria genetics march 1 2000 vol 154 no 3 985–997 
there are three known mechanisms of  resistance some types of  pumps can act to decrease intracellular  concentration  in gram negative bacteria plasmid mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to  protecting it from the action of quinolones finally mutations at key sites in dna gyrase or  can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones decreasing the drugs effectiveness 
antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols sometimes used as a  to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of dna that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest a recent study demonstrated that the extent of  among staphylococcus is much greater than previously expected—and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence and beyond genes residing within the  
for a long time it has been thought that for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic it must be in a large population however recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance we know now that small populations of ecoli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate the development of antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations and this is also true for the human body researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four snp mutations in the genome of ecoli produced by the gradient of antibiotic these mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance
 
 colloquially known as staph aureus or a staph infection is one of the major resistant pathogens found on the  and the  of around a third of the population it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure it was one of the earlier bacteria in which  resistance was found—in 1947 just four years after the drug started being mass produced  was then the antibiotic of choice but has since been replaced by  due to significant kidney toxicity  mrsa was first detected in britain in 1961 and is now quite common in hospitals mrsa was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of  in the  in 1999 up from 4% in 1991 half of all s aureus infections in the  are resistant to penicillin methicillin  and 
this left  as the only effective agent available at the time however strains with intermediate 4–8ampnbspμg ml levels of resistance termed glycopeptide intermediate staphylococcus aureus gisa or vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus visa began appearing in the late 1990s the first identified case was in japan in 1996 and strains have since been found in hospitals in england france and the us the first documented strain with complete 16ampnbspμg ml resistance to vancomycin termed  vrsa appeared in the united states in 2002  however in 2011 a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity

in   or  or its secreted form   in simpler terms an antigen is any substance that causes an immune system to produce antibodies against it  each antibody is specifically selected after binding to a certain antigen because of  in the antibody s
in summary an antigen is a  that binds to ag specific receptors but cannot induce an immune response in the body by itself name referencea  the term originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody it expanded to er to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment that can be recognized by highly variable antigen receptors  or  of the adaptive immune system
the antigen may originate from within the body self antigen or from the external environment non self the immune system usually does not react to self antigens under normal  conditions due to  of  in the  and is supposed to identify and attack only non self invaders from the outside world or modified harmful substances present in the body under

at the molecular level an antigen can be characterized by its ability to bind to an antibodys  different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific s present on the antigen surface  is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope in order to induce an immune response it has to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a   antigens are usually s and s and less frequently s this includes parts coats capsules cell walls flagella fimbrae and toxins of  es and other s s and s are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides non microbial non self antigens can include pollen egg white and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells s are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form which are intentionally administered to induce the memory function of  toward the antigens of the pathogen invading the recipient
 coined the term  in german antikörper in his  at the end of 19th century  in 1899  1874–1939 named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies substances immunogenes ou antigenes antigenic or immunogenic substances he originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies just as  is a precursor of an enzyme but by 1903 he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies antibodies and wrote that the word antigen is a contraction of antisomatogen  immunkörperbildner the oxford english dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be antibody gen name lindenmann 
  – the distinct surface features of an antigen its antigenic determinant antigenic molecules normally large biological polymers usually present surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies any such feature constitutes an epitope most antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies each of which is specific to one of the antigens epitopes using the lock and key metaphor the antigen can be seen as a string of keys epitopes each of which matches a different lock antibody different antibody  each have distinctly formed s
  – a substance capable of causing an  the detrimental reaction may result after exposure via ingestion inhalation injection or contact with skin

  – a substance that invokes a specific immune non responsive due to its  if its molecular form is changed a tolerogen can become an immunogen
  binding protein – proteins such as   and  that are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen binding site while antigens are the target of antibodies immunoglobulin binding proteins attack antibodies 
 t dependent antigen – antigens that require the assistance of t cells to induce the formation of specific antibodies
 t independent antigen –  usually that stimulate b cells directly
 immunodominant antigens – antigens that dominate over all others from a  in their ability to produce an immune response t cell responses typically are directed against a relatively few immunodominant epitopes although in some cases eg infection with the  pathogen  it is dispersed over a relatively large number of parasite antigens 
antigens can be classified according to their source
exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside for example by   or  the immune systems response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical by  or  exogenous antigens are taken into the s apcs and processed into fragments apcs then present the fragments to  sup+ sup by the use of  molecules on their surface some t cells are specific for the peptidemhc complex they become activated and start to secrete s substances that activate  ctl antibody secreting   and other particles
some antigens start out as exogenous and later become endogenous for example intracellular viruses intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell
endogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal cell  or because of viral or intracellular bacterial  the fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with  molecules if activated  recognize them the t cells secrete various s that cause the  or  of the infected cell in order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self proteins the cytotoxic cells self reactive t cells are deleted as a result of  negative selection endogenous antigens include  heterologous  and  or  homologous antigens

neoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome as compared with nonmutated self antigens neoantigens are of relevance to tumor control as the quality of the t cell pool that is available for these antigens is not affected by central t cell tolerance technology to systematically analyze t cell reactivity against neoantigens became available only recently name ss15

an autosome is a  that is not an  a sex chromosome   autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a  cell whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine  sex  the  in autosomes is collectively known as  or http  wwwisoggorg wiki autosomal_dna 
for example s have a   that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one  pair 46 chromosomes total the autosome pairs are labeled with numbers 1 22 in humans roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs while allosomes are labeled with their lettershttp  ghrnlmnihgov glossary autosome   by contrast the allosome pair consists of two s in females or one x and one  in males unusual combinations of      or  among  are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities it is important to note that autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes for example the  gene on the y chromosome encodes the transcription factor  and is vital for male sex determination during development tdf functions by activating the  gene on  so mutations of the  gene can cause humans with a y chromosome to develop as femalesfoster jamie w et al campomelic dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal caused by mutations in an sry related gene nature 3726506 1994 525 529 
all human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from a cell arrested in  or  and then staining them with some sort of dye most commonly   these chromosomes are typically viewed as s for easy comparison clinical geneticists can compare the karyogram of an individual to a erence karyogram to discover the cytogenetic basis of certain s for example the karyogram of someone with  would show that they possess three copies of  karyograms and staining techniques can only detect large scale disruptions to chromosomes—chromosomal aberrations smaller than a few million base pairs generally cannot be seen on a karyogramnussbaum rl mcinnes rr willard hf hamosh a thompson mw thompson amp thompson genetics in medicine 7th ed page 69 philadelphia saunders elsevier 2007

autosomal genetic disorders can arise due to a number of causes some of the most common being  in parental germ cells or  of deleterious alleles from parents autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an  or recessive fashion name 0   these disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency name 0   autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child as the child only needs to inherit one copy of the deleterious  to manifest the disease autosomal recessive diseases however require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers also known as s for the condition
autosomal  can also result in disease conditions aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus fetuses with aneuploidy of gene rich chromosomes—such as —never survive to term name 1  and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene poor chromosomes—such as — are still miscarried over 23% of the time  possessing a single copy of an autosome known as a monosomy is nearly always incompatible with life though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth having three copies of an autosome known as a trisomy is far more compatible with life however a common example is  which is caused by possessing three copies of  instead of the usual two name 1  
partial aneuploidy can also occur as a result of  during meiosis  deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial monosomies while duplications can cause partial trisomies if the duplication or deletion is large enough it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases ranging from  to    unlike single gene disorders diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper  not nonfunctional gene product

blockquote this matter isnt about any specific person and is not about the al qaidah organization we are the children of an islamic nation with prophet muhammad as its leader our lord is one and all the true believers mumineen are brothers so the situation isnt like the west portrays it that there is an organization with a specific name such as al qaidah and so on that particular name is very old it was born without any intention from us brother abu ubaida created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious arrogant brutal terrorizing soviet empire so this place was called the base al qaidah as in a training base so this name grew and became we arent separated from this nation we are the children of a nation and we are an inseparable part of it and from those public  which spread from the far east from the philippines to indonesia to malaysia to india to pakistan reaching mauritania and so we discuss the conscience of this nation name islamicawakening  blockquote

what exactly al qaeda is or was remains in dispute certainly it has been obliged to evolve and adapt in the aftermath of 9 11 and the launch of the war on terror

however author and journalist  argues that the idea of al qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an american invention curtis contends the name al qaeda was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin laden and the four men accused of the  in east africa
blockquotethe reality was that bin laden and ayman al zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy but there was no organization these were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin laden for funding and assistance he was not their commander there is also no evidence that bin laden used the term al qaeda to er to the name of a group until after september 11 attacks when he realized that this was the term the americans had given it name the power of nightmareshttps  archiveorg details thepowerofnightmares the power of nightmares bbc documentary  blockquote

according to the award winning 2004 bbc documentary  al qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin laden and a small clique of close associates the lack of any significant numbers of convicted al qaeda members despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al qaeda existed

# provoke the united states and the west into invading a muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on us soil that results in massive civilian casualties
# incite local resistance to occupying forces
# expand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the us and its allies in a long war of attrition
# convert al qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control and via these franchises incite attacks against the us and countries allied with the us until they withdraw from the conflict as happened with the  but which did not have the same effect with the 
# the us economy will finally collapse by the year 2020 under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places making the worldwide economic system which is dependent on the us also collapse leading to global political instability which in turn leads to a global jihad led by al qaeda and a   will then be installed across the world following the collapse of the us and the rest of the western world countries
atwan also noted regarding the collapse of the us if this sounds far fetched it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the  name atwan 
according to  a jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with al zarqawi al qaedas strategy plan consists of 7 phases and is similar to the plan described in al qaedas strategy to the year 2020 
# the awakening this phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003 the goal of the phase is to provoke the united states to attack a muslim country by executing an attack on us soil that kills many civilians
# opening eyes this phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006 the goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al qaeda group into a movement iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states
# arising and standing up was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010 in this phase al qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on syria hussein believed that other countries in the  were also in danger
# in the fourth phase al qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the arabian peninsula the main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and  targeting the us economy and military infrastructure
# the fifth phase is the declaration of an islamic caliphate which was projected between 2013 and 2016 in this phase al qaeda expected the resistance from israel to be heavily reduced
# the sixth phase is described as the declaration of an islamic army and a fight between believers and non believers also called total confrontation
# definitive victory the seventh and last phase is projected to be completed by 2020 the world will be beaten down by the islamic army according to the 7 phase strategy the war isnt projected to last longer than 2 years

it has been argued that two documents seized from the  office of the  prove that the name was not simply adopted by the mujahid movement and that a group called al qaeda was established in august 1988 both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group and contain the term al qaeda wright indirectly quotes one of the documents based on an exhibit from the tareek osama document presented in span class plainlinkshttp  fl1findlawcom newsfindlawcom hdocs docs bif usarnaout10603profpdf united states v enaam m arnaout span 
former british foreign secretary  wrote that the word al qaeda should be translated as the database and originally erred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with cia help to defeat the russians  in april 2002 the group assumed the name qaidat al jihad which means the base of jihad according to  this was apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of egypts  egyptian islamist jihad or eij group led by  with the groups bin laden brought under his control after his return to afghanistan in the mid 1990shttp  weeklyahramorgeg 2003 619 op13htm after mombassa  january 2–8 2003 issue no 619 retrieved september 3 2006 
the radical  movement in general and al qaeda in particular developed during the  and  of the last three decades of the 20th century along with less extreme movements the  against the pro soviet government december 1979 to february 1989 developed the  movement of which al qaeda was the most prominent example 
some have argued that without the writings of islamic author and thinker  al qaeda would not have existed  qutb preached that because of the lack of  law the muslim world was no longer muslim having reverted to pre islamic ignorance known as 
to restore islam he said a vanguard movement of righteous muslims was needed to establish true  implement sharia and rid the muslim world of any non muslim influences such as concepts like socialism and nationalism enemies of islam in qutbs view included treacherous orientalists  and world jewry who plotted conspiracies and wickedly opposed islam
in the words of  a close college friend of bin laden blockquoteislam is different from any other religion its a way of life we khalifa and bin laden were trying to understand what islam has to say about how we eat who we marry how we talk we read sayyid qutb he was the one who most affected our generation  blockquote
qutb had an even greater influence on bin ladens mentor and another leading member of al qaeda  ayman al zawahiri zawahiris uncle and maternal family patriarch mafouz azzam was qutbs student then protégé then personal lawyer and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see qutb before his execution young ayman al zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle mahfouz about the purity of qutbs character and the torment he had endured in prisonmafouz azzam cited in   zawahiri paid homage to qutb in his work knights under the prophets banner 
one of the most powerful of qutbs ideas was that many who said they were muslims were not rather they were s that not only gave jihadists a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another muslim but made it a religious obligation to execute these self professed muslims these alleged apostates included leaders of muslim countries since they failed to enforce sharia law

 has described five distinct phases in the development of al qaeda beginnings in the late 1980s a wilderness period in 1990–96 its heyday in 1996–2001 a network period from 2001 to 2005 and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to today 
the origins of al qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the  december 1979 – february 1989 name cooley  the us viewed the conflict in afghanistan with the afghan s and allied soviet troops on one side and the native afghan mujahideen some of whom were radical islamic militants on the other as a blatant case of soviet expansionism and aggression a cia program called  channeled funds through pakistans  agency to the afghan mujahideen who were fighting the soviet occupation name 1986 1992 cia and british recruit and train militants worldwide to help fight afghan war 
at the same time a growing number of arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the  facilitated by international muslim organizations particularly the  name maktab al khidamat globalsecurity  which was funded by the saudi arabia government as well as by individual muslims particularly saudi businessmen who were approached by bin laden together these sources donated some 600ampnbspmillion a year to jihad 
in 1984  mak or the services office a muslim organization founded to raise and channel funds and recruit foreign mujahideen for the war against the soviets in afghanistan was established in peshawar pakistan by bin laden and  a palestinian islamic scholar and member of the  mak organized  in peshawar near the afghan border and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the afghan war front bin laden became a major financier of the mujahideen spending his own money and using his connections with the saudi royal family and the petro billionaires of the gulf to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds quotes taken from  and

the soviet union finally withdrew from afghanistan in 1989 to the surprise of many s communist afghan government hung on for three more years before being overrun by elements of the mujahideen with mujahideen leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance chaos ensued with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill defined territories leaving the country devastated
toward the end of the  mission in afghanistan some mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include islamist struggles in other parts of the world such as israel and  a number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed to further those aspirations
one of these was the organization that would eventually be called al qaeda formed by bin laden with an initial meeting held on august 11 1988 name guardianobserverhistory  name the osama bin laden i know 
notes of a meeting of bin laden and others on august 20 1988 indicate al qaeda was a formal group by that time basically an organized islamic faction its goal is to lift the word of god to make his religion victorious a list of requirements for membership itemized the following listening ability good manners obedience and making a pledge  to follow ones superiors

according to wright the groups real name wasnt used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret  his research suggests that al qaeda was formed at an august 11 1988 meeting between several senior leaders of egyptian islamic jihad  and bin laden where it was agreed to join bin ladens money with the expertise of the islamic jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the soviets withdrew from afghanistan name rebellionwright 
bin laden wished to establish non military operations in other parts of the world azzam in contrast wanted to remain focused on military campaigns after azzam was assassinated in 1989 the mak split with a significant number joining bin ladens organization
in november 1989  a former special forces sergeant stationed at  north carolina left military service and moved to california he traveled to afghanistan and pakistan and became deeply involved with bin ladens plans 
a year later on november 8 1990 the fbi raided the new jersey home of ali mohammeds associate  discovering a great deal of evidence of terrorist plots including plans to blow up new york city skyscrapers  nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993  in 1991 ali mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin ladens relocation to sudan 
following the soviet unions withdrawal from afghanistan in february 1989 bin laden returned to saudi arabia the  in august 1990 had put the kingdom and its ruling  at risk the worlds most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of iraqi forces in kuwait and saddams call to pan arab islamism could potentially rally internal dissent
in the face of a seemingly massive iraqi military presence saudi arabias own forces were well armed but far outnumbered bin laden offered the services of his mujahideen to  to protect saudi arabia from the iraqi army the saudi monarch used bin ladens offer opting instead to allow us and allied forces to deploy troops into saudi territory 
the deployment angered bin laden as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the land of the two mosques  and  profaned sacred soil after speaking publicly against the saudi government for harboring american troops he was banished and forced to live in exile in sudan
from around 1992 to 1996 al qaeda and bin laden based themselves in sudan at the invitation of islamist theoretician  the move followed an islamist coup détat in sudan led by colonel  who professed a commitment to reordering muslim political values during this time bin laden assisted the sudanese government bought or set up various business enterprises and established camps where insurgents trained
a key turning point for bin laden further pitting him against the sauds occurred in 1993 when saudi arabia gave support for the  which set a path for peace between israel and  
zawahiri and the eij who served as the core of al qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the egyptian government had bad luck in sudan in 1993 a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful eij attempt on the life of the egyptian prime minister  egyptian public opinion turned against islamist bombings and the police arrested 280 of al jihads members and executed 6 
due to bin ladens continuous verbal assault on king fahd of saudi arabia on march 5 1994 fahd sent an emissary to sudan demanding bin ladens passport bin ladens saudi citizenship was also revoked his family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend 7ampnbspmillion  today a year and his saudi assets were frozen  name osama bin laden a chronology of his political life  his family publicly disowned him there is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and or the saudi government name context of shortlly after april 1994 
in june 1995 an even more ill fated  led to the expulsion of eij and in may 1996 of bin laden by the sudanese government

after the soviet withdrawal afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various mujahideen groups
throughout the 1990s a new force began to emerge the origins of the  literally students lay in the children of afghanistan many of them orphaned by the war and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of islamic schools s either in  or in the ugee camps on the afghan pakistani border

many of the mujahideen who later joined the taliban fought alongside afghan warlord s harkat i inqilabi group at the time of the russian invasion this group also enjoyed the loyalty of most afghan arab fighters
the continuing internecine strife between various factions and accompanying lawlessness following the soviet withdrawal enabled the growing and well disciplined taliban to expand their control over territory in afghanistan and it came to establish an enclave which it called the  in 1994 it captured the regional center of kandahar and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter conquered the capital city  in september 1996
after the sudanese made it clear in may 1996 that bin laden would never be welcome to return taliban controlled afghanistan—with previously established connections between the groups administered with a shared militancy  and largely isolated from american political influence and military power—provided a perfect location for al qaeda to relocate its headquarters al qaeda enjoyed the talibans protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their ministry of defense although only pakistan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates recognized the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan
while in afghanistan the taliban government tasked al qaeda with the training of  an elite part of the talibans army from 1997–2001 the brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters many veterans from the soviet invasion and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen in november 2001 as  had toppled the taliban government many brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed and those that survived were thought to head into pakistan along with bin laden

around 1994 the salafi groups waging  in bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline as they grew less and less aggressive groups such as eij began to drift away from the salafi cause in europe al qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist  in bosnia in late 1995
at the same time al qaeda ideologues instructed the networks recruiters to look for  muslims who believed that extremist jihad must be fought on a global level the concept of a global salafi jihad had been around since at least the early 1980s several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non muslims out of every muslim land at the same time and with maximum carnage this was however a fundamentally defensive strategy
al qaeda sought to open the offensive phase of the global salafi jihad  bosnian islamists in 2006 called for solidarity with islamic causes around the world supporting the insurgents in kashmir and iraq as well as the groups fighting for a palestinian state 
in 1996 al qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered islamic lands bin laden issued a fatwa binding religious edict  which amounted to a public declaration of war against the us and its allies and began to ocus al qaedas resources on large scale propagandist strikes
on february 23 1998 bin laden and ayman al zawahiri a leader of egyptian islamic jihad along with three other islamist leaders co signed and issued a fatwa calling on muslims to kill americans and their allies where they can when they cansummary taken from bin ladens may 26 1998 interview with american journalist  most recently broadcast in the documentary age of terror part 4 with translations checked by barry purkis archive researcher  under the banner of the  they declared

neither bin laden nor al zawahiri possessed the traditional islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa however they rejected the authority of the contemporary  which they saw as the paid servants of  rulers and took it upon themselves by issuing fatwas bin laden and his followers are acting out a kind of self appointment as alim they are asserting their rights as interpreters of islamic law  former russian  agent  who was later killed said that the fsb trained al zawahiri in a camp in  eight months before the 1998 fatwa

al qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks and very rarely makes wire transfers 
on december 29 1992 al qaedas first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in  yemen the first target was the movenpick hotel and the second was the parking lot of the goldmohur hotel
the bombings were an attempt to eliminate american soldiers on their way to somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort  internally al qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the americans away but in the us the attack was barely noticed
no americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether and they went on to somalia as scheduled however two people were killed in the bombing an australian tourist and a yemeni hotel worker seven others mostly yemenis were severely injured name wright174  two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al qaedas members  to justify the killings according to islamic law salim erred to a famous fatwa appointed by  a 13th century scholar much admired by wahhabis which sanctioned resistance by any means during the mongol invasions

messages issued by bin laden after september 11 2001 praised the attacks and explained their motivation while denying any involvement  bin laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and islamist muslims such as the general perception that the us was actively oppressing muslims 
bin laden asserted that america was massacring muslims in    and iraq and that muslims should retain the right to attack in reprisal he also claimed the 9 11 attacks were not targeted at people but americas icons of military and economic power despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning where most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating massive amount of human casualtieshamid miir osama claims he has nukes if us uses n arms it will get the same response dawn the internet edition november 10 2001

in december 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin laden was posted directly to a website rather than sending a copy to  as he had done in the past
al qaeda turned to the internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited rather than risk the possibility of al jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the   bin ladens december 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech lasting over an hour

a variety of sources— journalist   brigadier mohammad yousaf and cia operatives involved in the afghan program such as —deny that the cia or other american officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin laden let alone armed trained coached or indoctrinated them
bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local afghans willing to fight  that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for american funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non american muslim sources that americans could not have trained mujahideen because pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in pakistan and none in afghanistan and that the afghan arabs were almost invariably militant islamists lexively hostile to westerners whether or not the westerners were helping the muslim afghans
according to bergen known for conducting the first television interview with bin laden in 1997 the idea that the cia funded bin laden or trained bin laden is a folk myth theres no evidence of this bin laden had his own money he was anti american and he was operating secretly and independently the real story here is the cia didnt really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him  but bergen conceded that in one strange incident the cia appeared to give visa help to mujahideen recruiter

alessandro giuseppe antonio anastasio volta  18 february 1745  5 march 1827 was an    and a pioneer of  and  name   wmnqsygiuliano pancaldi volta science and culture in the age of enlightenment princeton university press 2003  name   nxukipalberto gigli berzolari voltas teaching in como and pavia   nuova voltiana http  wwwedisontechcenterorg halloffamehtml hall of fame edison  who is credited as the inventor of the  and the discoverer of  he invented the  in 1799 and the results of which he reported in 1800 in a two part letter to the president of the   name royalsocref  with this invention volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debased the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings voltas invention sparked a great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments which eventually led to the development of the field of electrochemistry name royalsocref 
alessandro volta also drew admiration from  for his invention and was invited to the  to demonstrate his invention to the members of the institute volta enjoyed a certain amount of closeness with the emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him name archivebook  alessandro volta held the chair of experimental physics at the  for nearly 40 years and was widely idolised by his students name archivebook 
despite his professional success volta tended to be a person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years at this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in 1827 from a series of illnesses which began in 1823 name archivebook  the  unit of  is named in his honour as the 
volta was born in  a town in present day northern  near the  border on 18 february 1745 in 1794 volta married an aristocratic lady also from como teresa peregrini with whom he raised three sons zanino flaminio and luigi his own father filippo volta was of noble lineage his mother donna maddalena came from the family of the inzaghis name alessandrovoltainfo_february_18_2015c 
in 1774 he became a professor of physics at the royal school in como a year later he improved and popularised the  a device that produced  his promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the swedish experimenter  p73 joh carl wilcke 1762 ytterligare rön och försök om contraira electriciteterne vid laddningen och därtil hörande delar additional findings and experiments on the opposing electric charges that are created during charging and parts related thereto kongliga svenska vetenskaps academiens handlingar proceedings of the royal swedish science academy vol 23 pages https  booksgooglecom booksid hhrjaaaacaajamplpg pa210ampots z7ronaculsamppg pa202#v onepageampqampf false 206 229 245–266  in 1777 he travelled through switzerland there he befriended 
in the years between 1776 and 1778 volta studied the  of gases he researched and discovered  after reading a paper by  of  on flammable air in november 1776 he found methane at alessandro volta lettere del signor don alessandro volta … sull aria inflammabile nativa delle paludi letters of signor don alessandro volta … on the flammable native air of the marshes milan italy  giuseppe marelli 1777  and by 1778 he managed to isolate methane  he devised experiments such as the  of methane by an electric  in a closed vessel
volta also studied what we now call electrical  developing separate means to study both electrical potential v  and charge q  and discovering that for a given object they are proportional name williams2014  this is called voltas law of capacitance and it was for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the  name williams2014 
in 1779 he became a professor of experimental physics at the  a chair that he occupied for almost 40 years name archivebook 
 an italian physicist discovered something he named animal electricity when two different metals were connected in series with a frogs leg and to one another volta realised that the frogs leg served as both a conductor of electricity what we would now call an  and as a detector of electricity he replaced the frogs leg with brine soaked paper and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies
in this way he discovered the  and the law that the  emf of a  consisting of a pair of metal s separated by electrolyte is the difference between their two electrode potentials thus two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf this may be called voltas law of the electrochemical series
in 1800 as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by galvani volta invented the  an early  which produced a steady electric current name routledge  volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was  and  initially he experimented with individual cells in series each cell being a wine goblet filled with  into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped the voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine
in announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile volta paid tribute to the influences of   and  
the battery made by volta is credited as the first electrochemical cell it consists of two electrodes one made of  the other of  the  is either  mixed with water or a form of saltwater  the electrolyte exists in the form 2hsup+ sup and sosub4 subsup2− sup the zinc which is higher in the  than both copper and hydrogen reacts with the negatively charged sulfate sosub4 subsup2− sup the positively charged hydrogen ions s capture s from the copper forming bubbles of hydrogen gas hsub2 sub this makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode
thus there are two terminals and an  will flow if they are connected the s in this voltaic cell are as follows
zinc
zn bigbig→ big big znsup2+ sup + 2esup− sup
sulfuric acid
2hsup+ sup + 2esup− sup bigbig→ big big hsub2 sub
the copper does not react but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current
however this cell also has some disadvantages it is unsafe to handle since sulfuric acid even if diluted can be hazardous also the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released instead it accumulates on the surface of the zinc electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution
in 1809 volta became associated member of the   in honour of his work volta was made a count by  in 1810 name   wmnqsy 
volta retired in 1819 to his estate in camnago a  of  now named camnago volta in his honour he died there on 5 march 1827 just after his 82nd birthday  voltas remains were buried in camnago voltafor a photograph of his gravesite and other volta locales see   
voltas legacy is celebrated by the  memorial located in the public gardens by the lake there is also a museum which has been built in his honour which exhibits some of the equipment that volta used to conduct experiments nearby stands the  which houses the voltian foundation an organization promoting scientific activities volta carried out his experimental studies and produced his first inventions near como
his image was depicted on the  1990 1997 along with a sketch of his voltaic pile

argo navis the ship argo or simply argo was a large  in the southern sky that has since been divided into three constellations it represented the  the ship used by  and the  in   the genitive was argus navis abbreviated arg   and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just navis the ship genitive navis abbreviated nav
due to  the stars of argo have been shifted farther south since classical times and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitude of the mediterranean 
the original constellation was found low near the southern horizon of the mediterranean sky the ship became visible in springtime and sailed westward skimming along the southern horizon the ancient greeks identified it with the ship sailed by jason and the argonauts in search of the golden fleece
argo navis is the only one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer  that is no longer officially recognized as a constellation it was unwieldy due to its enormous size in 1752 the french astronomer  subdivided it into  the  or the hull of the ship  the  or  and  the s lacaille replaced bayers  with new ones but like bayer he used a single greek letter sequence for the three parts carina has α β and ε vela has γ and δ puppis has ζ and so on name wagmanmorton wagman lost stars mcdonald and woodward 2003 isbn 0 939923 78 5  for the dimmer stars however lacaille used a separate latin letter sequence for each part name wagman   the duplication of omicron in vela and puppis appears to contradict this but omicron puppis is an error for lacailles o puppis latin oh name wagman  
the constellation  the  occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of argos mast some authors state that pyxis was part of the greek conception of argo navisjohn scalzi 2008 rough guide to the universe p 240 isbn 9781405383707 david h kelley et al 2011 exploring ancient skies a survey of ancient and cultural astronomy p 12 9781441976246 emily winterburn 2009 the stargazers guide p 124 isbn 9780061976377  but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient greek times lacaille considered it a separate constellation representing one of the modern scientific instruments he placed among the constellations like  and  in the notes to his preliminary catalogue published in 1756 lacaille wrote “i have divided argo into three parts namely la pouppe puppis le corps carina amp la voilure vela”lacaille n histoire de lacadémie royale des sciences 1752 published 1756 p 590  pyxis was listed separately among his 14 new constellations lacaille assigned bayer designations to pyxis separate from those of carina puppis and vela and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of argo name wagman    in 1844 john herschel suggested formalizing the mast as a new constellation  to replace lacailles pyxis but the idea did not catch on

as a subject andromeda has been popular in art since classical times it is one of several greek myths of a s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic  sacred marriage giving rise to the   from the  interest revived in the original story typically as derived from s account
in  andromeda was the daughter of  and  king and queen of the north african kingdom of 
her mother cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the  the  daughters of the sea god  and often seen accompanying  to punish the queen for her arrogance poseidon brother to  and god of the sea sent a sea monster named  to ravage the coast of aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen the desperate king consulted the  of apollo who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter andromeda to the monster stripped naked she was chained to a rock on the coast
 was returning from having slain the   after he happened upon the chained andromeda he approached cetus while invisible for he was wearing hadess helm and killed the sea monster he set andromeda free and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle  at the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals and phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the gorgons head  v 1 
andromeda followed her husband first to his native island of  where he rescued his mother  and then to  in  together they became the ancestors of the family of the perseidae through the line of their son perses perseus and andromeda had seven sons       and  as well as two daughters  and  their descendants ruled mycenae from  down to  after whom  attained the kingdom and would also include the great hero  according to this mythology perseus is the ancestor of the 
at the port city of  today part of  an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of andromedas chaining and rescue by the traveler  the geographer  and the historian of the jews pausanias iv359 strabo xvi28 josephus jewish war iii93 
after andromedas death as  had promised  at the end of his  produced in 412 bce the heroes of the greeks 195953 euripides drama is lost save some fragments  the goddess placed her among the s in the northern sky near perseus and  the  so known since antiquity is named after her
andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the   which contains the

 a smaller figure next to the man sitting on a chair as it is near the  it may be seen by observers in the northern hemisphere through the whole year although sometimes upside down the constellation 
 a maiden chained up facing or turning away from the ecliptic the constellation  next to 
 a  just under the ecliptic the constellation 
other constellations related to the story are
 
 the constellation  who was born from the stump of s neck after perseus had decapitated her
 the constellation  which may have been treated as two fish caught by  the  who was brother of  king of  the place where perseus and his mother  were stranded
 and  and in more modern times  made the story the subject of  and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art including greek vases s opera  also dramatizes the myth
andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art which typically show the moment of rescue with andromeda usually still chained and often naked or nearly so examples include one of s poesies  and compositions by    rennes   and  from the  onward the chained nude figure of andromeda typically was the centre of interest  s  is unusual in showing her alone fearfully awaiting the monster
the italian composer  composed an hour long operatic drama called perseo e andromeda in 2000
in 1973 an animated film called perseus 20 minutes was made in the  as part of the soviet animated film collection called legends and mуths of ancient greece  
the 1981 film  retells the story of perseus andromeda and cassiopeia but makes a few changes notably cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than  as opposed to the nereids as a group thetis was indeed a nereid and also the future mother of  andromeda and perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of thetis son calibos whereas in the myth they simply meet as perseus returns home from having slain  in the film the monster is called a  although it is depicted as a lizard like creature rather than a squid and combining two elements of the myth perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it medusas face turning the monster into stone andromeda is depicted as being strong willed and independent whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom perseus saves from the sea monster andromeda was portrayed by  in this film
andromeda also features in the 2010 film  a remake of the 1981 version several changes were made in regard to the myth most notably that perseus did not marry andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster andromeda was portrayed by  the character was played by  in the sequel  the second of a planned  in the end of the sequel perseus and andromeda begin a relationship
in the japanese anime  the character  represents the  using chains as his main weapons reminiscent of andromeda being chained before she was saved by perseus in order to attain the andromeda cloth he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him also reminiscent of this myth
andromeda appears in s  as a new student of prometheus academy which hercules and other characters from greek mythology attend 
in s  series there are a few erences to andromeda the most obvious is that the series lead villains have a  which serves as their headquarters and is called the princess andromeda
andromeda is the main character in s short story miss manners guide to greek missology published in s chicks in chainmail series of humorous feminist fantasy collections and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards it is a satire filled with role reversals puns and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture

antlia  from  ἀντλία is a  in the southern sky its name means  and it specifically represents an air pump the constellation was created in the 18th century from an undesignated region of sky so the stars comprising antlia are faint the brightest star is  is an orange  that is a suspected  ranging between s 422 and 429  a  and the  lie within antlias borders
the french astronomer   first described the constellation in french as la machine pneumatique the pneumatic pump in 1751–52 name ridpathlac   commemorating the  invented by the french physicist  name startales  he had observed and catalogued almost 10000 southern stars during a two year stay at the  devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the  not visible from europe all but one honoured instruments that symbolised the  lacaille latinised the name to antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart john herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word which was universally taken up
though antlia was technically visible to ancient greek astronomers its stars were too faint to have been included in any constellations name startales  because of this its main stars have no particular pattern and it is devoid of bright deep sky objects name moore 
lacaille and  each depicted antlia differently as either the single cylinder vacuum pump used in papins initial experiments or the more advanced double cylinder version name startales  the  subsequently adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations there is no mythology attached to antlia as lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose names mostly from scientific instruments name startales 
according to some the most prominent stars that now comprise antlia were once included within the ancient constellation  the ship of the argonauts which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by lacaille in 1763peter birren 2002 objects in the heavens pp 9 45 isbn 155369662x thomas william webb dover publications 1962 celestial objects for common telescopes volume 2 p 36  however given the faintness and obscurity of its stars most authorities do not believe that the ancient greeks included antlia as part of their classical depiction of argo navisian ridpath 2002 stars and planets pp 65 122 isbn 0 7894 8988 0 
chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern antlia from their latitudes and incorporated its stars into two different constellations several stars in the southern part of antlia were a portion of dongou which represented an area in southern china name startales  furthermore   and  were incorporated into the celestial temple which also contained stars from modern  name startales

lacaille gave nine stars s labelling them alpha through to theta including two stars next to each other as zeta gould later added a tenth  beta and gamma antliae now  and  ended up in the neighbouring constellation hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930 within the constellations borders there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to ampnbsp65 name tirionconst

sir alexander fleming  name frs  6 august 188111 march 1955 was a scottish   and  his best known discoveries are the   in 1923 and the  substance benzylpenicillin penicillin g from the mould  in 1928 for which he shared the  in 1945 with  and  name lesprixnobel      name natureobit  he wrote many articles on bacteriology immunology and chemotherapy
fleming was born on 6 august  1881 at lochfield farm near  in  scotland he was the third of the four children of farmer hugh fleming 1816–1888 from his second marriage to grace stirling morton 1848–1928 the daughter of a neighbouring farmer hugh fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage he was 59 at the time of his second marriage and died when alexander known as alex was seven
fleming went to  and darvel school and earned a two year scholarship to  before moving to london where he attended the  name penicillin man  after working in a shipping office for four years the twenty year old fleming inherited some money from an uncle john fleming his elder brother tom was already a physician and suggested to his younger sibling that he should follow the same career and so in 1903 the younger alexander enrolled at  in  he qualified with an  degree from the school with distinction in 1906
fleming had been a private in the  of the  since 1900 name lesprixnobel   and had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school the captain of the club wishing to retain fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at st marys where he became assistant bacteriologist to sir  a pioneer in  therapy and immunology in 1908 he gained a  degree with gold medal in  and became a lecturer at st marys until 1914
fleming served throughout  as a captain in the  and was  he and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the  in france in 1918 he returned to  where he was elected professor of bacteriology of the  in 1928 in 1951 he was elected the rector of the  for a term of 3 years
following world war i fleming actively searched for anti bacterial agents having witnessed the death of many soldiers from  resulting from infected   killed the patients immunological defences more effectively than they killed the invading bacteria in an article he submitted for the medical journal  during world war i fleming described an ingenious experiment which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during world war i antiseptics worked well on the surface but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach sir  strongly supported flemings findings but despite this most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients

at st mary’s hospital fleming continued his investigations into antibacterial substances  testing the nasal secretions from a patient with a heavy cold he found that nasal mucus had an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth   this was the first recorded discovery of  an enzyme present in many secretions including tears saliva human milk as well as mucus  lysozyme degrades the bonds in bacterial peptidoglycan cell walls particularly in gram positive organisms  unfortunately lysozyme had little therapeutic potential
when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 1928 i certainly didnt plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the worlds first antibiotic or bacteria killer fleming would later say but i suppose that was exactly what i did name isbn1 56308 159 8 
by 1927 fleming had been investigating the properties of  he was already well known from his earlier work and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher but his laboratory was often untidy on 3 september 1928 fleming returned to his laboratory having spent august on holiday with his family before leaving he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory on returning fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal famously remarking thats funny name brownbrown k 2004 penicillin man alexander fleming and the antibiotic revolution 320 pp sutton publishing isbn 0 7509 3152 3  fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant merlin price who reminded him thats how you discovered hare r the birth of penicillin allen amp unwin london 1970  fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease causing bacteria he identified the mould as being from the  genus and after some months of calling it mould juice named the substance it released  on 7 march 1929diggins f the true history of the discovery of penicillin by alexander fleming biomedical scientist march 2003 insititute of biomedical sciences london originally published in the imperial college school of medicine gazette  the laboratory in which fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the  in st marys hospital 
he investigated its positive anti bacterial effect on many organisms and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other  pathogens that cause    and  but not  or  which are caused by  bacteria for which he was seeking a cure at the time it also affected  which causes  although this bacterium is gram negative
fleming published his discovery in 1929 in the british journal of experimental pathology name pmid6994200  but little attention was paid to his article fleming continued his investigations but found that cultivating penicillium was quite difficult and that after having grown the mould it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent flemings impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity and because its action appeared to be rather slow penicillin would not be important in treating infection fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body in vivo to kill bacteria effectively many clinical tests were inconclusive probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic in the 1930s fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise   and he continued until 1940 to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further ine usable penicillin fleming finally abandoned penicillin and not long after he did  and  at the  in oxford took up researching and mass producing it with funds from the us and british governments they started mass production after the bombing of  by  in 1944 enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded with the 
in oxford  and  discovered how to isolate and concentrate penicillin abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillinin october 1943 abraham proposed a molecular structure which included a cyclic formation containing three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom the β lactam ring not then known in natural products this structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy and was initially strongly disputed by sir robert robinson among others but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin using x ray analysis oxford dictionary of national biography abraham sir edward penley   shortly after the team published its first results in 1940 fleming telephoned  chains head of department to say that he would be visiting within the next few days when chain heard that fleming was coming he remarked good god i thought he was dead
 suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity this produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals there were many more people involved in the oxford team and at one point the entire dunn school was involved in its production
after the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940 several clinical trials ensued and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945
fleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin describing his fame as the fleming myth and he praised florey and chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance giving him the privilege of naming it penicillin he also kept grew and distributed the original mould for twelve years and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin but sir  said in 1998 without fleming no chain without chain no florey without florey no heatley without heatley no penicillinhenry harris howard florey and the development of penicillin a lecture given on 29 september 1998 at the florey centenary 1898–1998 sir william dunn school of pathology oxford university sound recording http  cataloguenlagovau record 1610017 
flemings accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in september 1928 marks the start of modern  before that several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or penicillium sp were able to inhibit bacterial growth and even to cure bacterial infections in animals  in 1897 in his thesis contribution to the study of vital competition in micro organisms antagonism between moulds and microbes name duchesne 1897http  wwwamazoncom dp b00dzvxpik duchesne 1897 antagonism between molds and bacteria an english translation by michael witty fort myers 2013 asin b00e0krz0e and b00dzvxpik  or also  whose work at institut pasteur in 1923 on the inhibiting action of fungi of the penicillin sp genre in the growth of staphylococci drew little interest from the direction of the institut at the time fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale fleming also discovered very early that  developed  whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period  had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world he cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used and that if it were used never to use too little or for too short a period since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops
the popular storyeg philadelphia enquirer 17 july 1945 brown penicillin man note 43 to chapter 2  of  paying for flemings education after flemings father saved young  from death is false according to the biography penicillin man alexander fleming and the antibiotic revolution by  alexander fleming in a letter14 november 1945 british library additional manuscripts 56115 brown penicillin man note 44 to chapter 2  to his friend and colleague andre gratiasee wikipedia  article entry for 1920  described this as a wondrous fable nor did he save winston churchill himself during  churchill was saved by  using  since he had no experience with penicillin when churchill fell ill in  in  in 1943  and  on 21 december 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin he was saved by the new sulphonamide drug  known at the time under the research code mampb 693 discovered and produced by    – a subsidiary of the french group  in a subsequent  churchill erred to the new drug as this admirable mampba history of may amp baker 1834–1984 alden press 1984  it is highly probable that the correct information about the  did not reach the newspapers because since the original sulphonamide antibacterial  had been a discovery by the german laboratory  and as britain was at war with  at the time it was thought better to raise british morale by associating churchills cure with a british discovery penicillin

in 1850 carnegie became a telegraph messenger boy in the pittsburgh office of the ohio telegraph company at 250 per week p 37  following the recommendation of his uncle
he was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of pittsburghs businesses and the faces of important men he made many connections this way he also paid close attention to his work and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced he developed the ability to translate signals by ear without using the paper slip pp 56 59  and within a year was promoted to operator carnegies education and passion for reading was given a great boost by colonel james anderson who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each saturday night p 45  carnegie was a consistent borrower and a self made man in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development he was so grateful to colonel anderson for the use of his library that he resolved if ever wealth came to me to see to it that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man   his capacity his willingness for hard work his perseverance and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities
starting in 1853  of the  employed carnegie as a secretary telegraph operator at a salary of 400 per week carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company name nasaw   at age 18 the precocious youth began a rapid advance through the company becoming the superintendent of the pittsburgh division his employment by the pennsylvania railroad company would be vital to his later success the railroads were the first big businesses in america and the pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years and from scott in particular name nasaw pp 54–59 64–65 
scott also helped him with his first investments many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by scott and the pennsylvanias president  which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with or payoffs made by contracting parties as part of a  name nasaw_pg59_60 pp 59–60  in 1855 scott made it possible for carnegie to invest 500 in the  which contracted with the pennsylvania to carry its messengers the money was secured by his mothers placing a 600 mortgage on the familys 700 home but the opportunity was available only because of carnegies close relationship with scott name nasaw_pg59_60  p 79  a few years later he received a few shares in s sleeping car company as a reward for holding shares that woodruff had given to scott and thomson as a payoff reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad related industries iron bridges and  carnegie slowly accumulated capital the basis for his later success throughout his later career he made use of his close connections to thomson and scott as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad offering the two men a stake in his enterprises
before the  carnegie arranged a merger between woodruffs company and that of  the inventor of a  for  which facilitated business travel at distances over  the investment proved a great success and a source of profit for woodruff and carnegie the young carnegie continued to work for the pennsylvanias tom scott and introduced several improvements in the service
in spring 1861 carnegie was appointed by scott who was now assistant secretary of war in charge of military transportation as superintendent of the military railways and the union governments telegraph lines in the east carnegie helped open the rail lines into washington dc that the rebels had cut he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of union troops to reach washington dc following the defeat of union forces at  he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces under his organization the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory carnegie later joked that he was the first casualty of the war when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire
defeat of the confederacy required vast supplies of s as well as railroads and telegraph lines to deliver the goods the war demonstrated how integral the industries were to american success
in 1864 carnegie invested 40000 in story farm on oil creek in  in one year the farm yielded over 1000000 in cash dividends and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably the demand for iron products such as armor for gunboats cannons and shells as well as a hundred other industrial products made pittsburgh a center of wartime production carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel  and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war
after the war carnegie left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade carnegie worked to develop several iron works eventually forming the keystone bridge works and the union ironworks in pittsburgh although he had left the pennsylvania railroad company he remained closely connected to its management namely thomas a scott and j edgar thomson he used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his  and the rails produced by his  he also gave stock to scott and thomson in his businesses and the pennsylvania was his best customer when he built his first steel plant he made a point of naming it after thomson as well as having good business sense carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge he was invited to many important social functions—functions that carnegie exploited to his own advantage pp 105–107 
carnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money he wrote

despite his efforts towards international peace carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest these dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties throughout the 1880s and 1890s for example carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized united states navy while he opposed american oversea expansioncarnegie an american four in hand in britain new york 1883 pp 14–15

carnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people that maintains the peace in international relations money is just a push for the act if world peace depended solely on financial support it would not seem a goal but more like an act of pity

in 1914 on the eve of the first world war carnegie founded the church peace union cpu a group of leaders in religion academia and politics through the cpu carnegie hoped to mobilize the worlds churches religious organizations and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever for its inaugural international event the cpu sponsored a conference to be held on august 1 1914 on the shores of lake constance in southern germany as the delegates made their way to the conference by train germany was invading belgium
despite its inauspicious beginning the cpu thrived today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the  an independent nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs
the outbreak of the first world war was clearly a shock to carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace although his promotion of  and world peace had all failed and the carnegie endowment had not fulfilled his expectations his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the  after his death which took world peace to another level

approximants are  that involve the  approaching each other but not narrowly enough  nor with enough articulatory precision citing   to create turbulent airflow theore approximants fall between  which do produce a turbulent airstream and s which produce no turbulence name martínez celdrán 2004 201  this class of sounds includes  approximants like  as in less non lateral approximants like  as in rest and  like  and  as in yes and west respectively name martínez celdrán 2004 201 
before  coined the term approximant in the 1960s pointing to   the term frictionless continuant erred to non lateral approximants
some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms  and glide are often used for these non syllabic vowel like segments the correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels citing  
vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment or for grammatical reasons as is the case with  similarly languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel citing   a number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable although he uses the terms interchangeably  remarks that for example the final glides of english par and buy differ from french par through and baille tub in that in the latter pair the approximants appear in the  whereas in the former they appear in the  this means that opaque if not minimal contrasts can occur in languages like  with the i like sound of piede foot appearing in the nucleus  and that of piano slow appearing in the syllable onset   and spanish with a near minimal pair being abyecto  abject and abierto  opened

 because of the articulatory complexities of the american english rhotic there is some variation in its phonetic description a transcription with the ipa character for an   is common though the sound is more  actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound citing   and   however  makes a distinction between the vowels of american english which he calls rhotacized and vowels with retroflexion such as those that appear in   on the other hand labels both as  and notes that both have a lowered third both cited in  
 because the vowels  are articulated with spread lips spreading is implied for their approximant analogues   however these sounds generally have little or no lip spreading the fricative letters with a lowering diacritic  may theore be justified for a neutral articulation between spread  and rounded  john esling 2010 phonetic notation in hardcastle laver amp gibbon eds the handbook of phonetic sciences 2nd ed p 699 
in articulation and often diachronically  approximants correspond to s  approximants to s and labialized approximants to s in american english the  approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel this can create alternations as shown in the above table
in addition to alternations glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to a hiatus  for example in  medial  triggers the formation of an inserted  that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix  is added to футбол football to make футболіст football player it is pronounced  but маоїст  with the same affix is pronounced  with a glide   has a similar process that extends to mid vowels 
 bioscoop →  cinema
 zee + en →  seas
 fluor →  fluor
 reu + en →  male dogs
 rwanda →   name dutchthere is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of  for speakers who realize it as   postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of  from glide insertion into  
 boaz →   name dutch 
similarly vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments  describes this behaviour for 
non high semivowels also occur in colloquial  speech a process of glide formation occurs where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non syllabic the process includes mid vowels so that  cause to wish features a non syllabic mid vowel  spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic  can occur so that ahorita right away is pronounced   it is not often clear however whether such sequences involve a semivowel a consonant or a diphthong a vowel and in many cases it may not be a meaningful distinction
although many languages have s  which lie between back velar  and front palatal  there are few cases of a corresponding approximant  one is in the korean diphthong  or https  pantherfileuwmedu iverson www kordiphpdf ahn amp iverson 2006  though it is more frequently analyzed as velar as in the table above and  may be another with three high vowel sounds    and three corresponding consonants  and  and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and  that is parallel to – and – an example is liq   whitelisten to a http  wwwlogosdictionaryorg sound mp 5119539_nwav recording 
in addition to less turbulence approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them  
when emphasized approximants may be slightly fricated that is the airstream may become slightly turbulent which is reminiscent of fricatives for example the  word ayuda help features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech  spanish can be analyzed as having a meaningful distinction between fricative approximant and intermediate martínez celdrán e 2004 problems in the classification of approximants journal of the international phonetic association 34 201–10  however such frication is generally slight and intermittent unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants 
because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs the increased air flow creates more turbulence making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants which are extremely rare cross linguistically  and voiceless fricatives difficult  this is why for example the voiceless labialized velar approximant  also transcribed with the special letter  has traditionally been labeled a fricative and no language is known to contrast it with a voiceless labialized velar fricative  name ladefoged 1996 326  similarly  has a voiceless  approximant  and  has a voiceless lateral fricative  but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages  again no language is known to contrast the two name ladefoged 1996 326    is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants with 
for places of articulation further back in the mouth languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants theore the ipa allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants with or without a lowering  
occasionally the glottal fricatives are called approximants since  typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants but they are often s of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation

the word aeon  also spelled eon and æon  originally meant life vital force or being generation or a period of time though it tended to be translated as age in the sense of  ages forever timeless or for  it is a  transliteration from the  word  ho aion from the archaic   aiwon in  it typically ers to life or lifespan its latest meaning is more or less similar to the  word  and  word  a    word aevum or aeuum cf  for age is present in words such as longevity and mediaevalhttp  wwwpballewnet arithm16html math words page 16   bot generated title

according to the christian doctrine of  the  scriptures use the word eon to mean a long period perhaps 1000 years and the word eonian to mean during a long period thus there was a time before the eons and the eonian period is finite after each mans mortal life ends he is judged worthy of eonian life or eonian punishment that is after the period of the eons all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then god becomes the all in each one   this contrasts with the conventional christian belief in eternal life and eternal punishment
