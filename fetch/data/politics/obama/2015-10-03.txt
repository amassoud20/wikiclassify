	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President emphasized that we need to do everything we can to strengthen economic growth and job creation.  This week, despite the fact that more than half of Republicans in Congress voted to shut down the government for the second time in two years, Congress managed to pass a last-minute bill to keep the government open for another ten weeks.  That means that in December, we could face yet another Republican threat to shut down the government.  The President emphasized that Congress needs to stop kicking the can down the road and do its job.  He stressed that Republicans and Democrats need to work together to pass a budget that fully funds the government and reverses the harmful sequestration cuts, and vowed that he would not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent him this past week.

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, October 3.
