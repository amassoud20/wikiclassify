	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, President Obama honored our nation’s veterans, who have served and sacrificed in defense of our country. This past week, Americans came together on Veterans Day to pay tribute to those men and women in uniform who have risked their lives to protect our freedom.  In recent years we’ve worked to reduce the veterans’ unemployment rate to 3.9 percent and slash the disability claims backlog at the VA by nearly 90 percent from its peak.  But there is still more that can be done.  Since day one of his Administration, the President has remained committed to serving the brave men and women who have served us.  And in his address, he reminded us that we all have a role to play in ensuring that veterans have the opportunities and support they deserve.

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov/weekly at 6:00 a.m. ET, November 14.
