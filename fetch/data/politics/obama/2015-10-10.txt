	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President spoke to the merits of the high-standards trade agreement reached this past week.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership helps level the playing field for American workers and businesses, so we can export more Made-in-America products all over the world, supporting higher-paying American jobs here at home.  The President acknowledged that past trade agreements have not always lived up to expectations, but emphasized that this is a good deal, with the strongest commitments on labor and environment of any trade agreement in history.  It reflects America’s values and gives our workers the fair shot at success they deserve.  The President encouraged everyone to read the agreement, which will be available online well before he signs it, and looked forward to working with lawmakers from both parties as they consider and approve this deal.

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, October 10.
