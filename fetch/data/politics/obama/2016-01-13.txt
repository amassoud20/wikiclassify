	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

	Tonight marks the eighth year that I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it a little shorter.  (Applause.)  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.  (Laughter.)  I've been there.  I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.  (Laughter.)  

	And I understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.  But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform -- (applause) -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse.  (Applause.)  So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again.  

	But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead.  Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.  And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done.  Fixing a broken immigration system.  (Applause.)  Protecting our kids from gun violence.  (Applause.)  Equal pay for equal work.  (Applause.)  Paid leave.  (Applause.)  Raising the minimum wage. (Applause.)  All these things still matter to hardworking families.  They’re still the right thing to do.  And I won't let up until they get done.

	But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to just talk about next year.  I want to focus on the next five years, the next 10 years, and beyond.  I want to focus on our future.

	We live in a time of extraordinary change -- change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world.  It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.  It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.  It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality.  And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.

	America has been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights.  Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.  And each time, we overcame those fears.  We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.”  Instead we thought anew, and acted anew.  We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people.  And because we did -- because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril -- we emerged stronger and better than before.

	What was true then can be true now.  Our unique strengths as a nation -- our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.  

	In fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.  It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.  It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.

	But such progress is not inevitable.  It’s the result of choices we make together.  And we face such choices right now.  Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people?  Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together? 

	So let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer -- regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress. 

	First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?  (Applause.)  

	Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us -- especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?  (Applause.)  

	Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?  (Applause.)  

	And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?

	Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact:  The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.  (Applause.)  We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history.  (Applause.)  More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s, an unemployment rate cut in half.  Our auto industry just had its best year ever.  (Applause.)  That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.  And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.  (Applause.)  
Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.  (Applause.)  Now, what is true -- and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious -- is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit; changes that have not let up.  
Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated.  Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition.  As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise.  Companies have less loyalty to their communities.  And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.
All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing.  It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to.  And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.
For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody.  We’ve made progress.  But we need to make more.  And despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.
We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.  The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering.  In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and -- (applause) -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one.  We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.  (Applause.)
And we have to make college affordable for every American.  (Applause.)  No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.  We’ve already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower’s income.  And that's good.  But now, we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college.  (Applause.)  Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year.  (Applause.)  It's the right thing to do.  (Applause.)  
But a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.  It’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber.  (Laughter.)  For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.  Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool and they may have to retrain.  But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process.
That’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever.  We shouldn’t weaken them; we should strengthen them. (Applause.)  And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.  That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about.  It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business, you’ll still have coverage.  Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far.  (Applause.)  And in the process, health care inflation has slowed.  And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon.  (Applause.)  A little applause right there.  (Laughter.)  Just a guess.  But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security.  Say a hardworking American loses his job -- we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him.  If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.  And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.  That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.
I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.  America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up.  And I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children.  (Applause.)   
But there are some areas where we just have to be honest -- it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years.  And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.  (Applause.) And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make.
I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.  I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed.  There is red tape that needs to be cut.  (Applause.)  There you go!  Yes!  (Applause.)  But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense.  (Applause.)  Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.  Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.  (Applause.)  Immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.  It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.  (Applause.)
The point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.  The rules should work for them.  (Applause.)  And I'm not alone in this.  This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders.  (Applause.)  And I want to spread those best practices across America.  That's part of a brighter future.  (Applause.)  
In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.  And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer:  How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there.  (Laughter.)  We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight.  And 12 years later, we were walking on the moon.  (Applause.)    
Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA.  America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.  America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.  America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better world.  (Applause.)  That's who we are.
And over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.  We’ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.  (Applause.)  We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.  But we can do so much more. 
Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.  Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade. (Applause.)  So tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done.  And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.  (Applause.)  For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.  (Applause.)  
Medical research is critical.  We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.  (Applause.)  Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.  You will be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.  (Applause.) 
But even if -- even if the planet wasn’t at stake, even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record -- until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? (Applause.)  
Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.  Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.  On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal -- in jobs that pay better than average.  We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.   And meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.  (Applause.)  

Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either.  (Applause.) 
Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources.  Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future -- especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.  We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going.  That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities, and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.  (Applause.)  
Now, none of this is going to happen overnight.  And, yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.  But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, the planet we’ll preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve.  And it's within our grasp.  
Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world.  And that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.
I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air.  Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.  Let me tell you something.  The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Period. (Applause.)  Period.  It’s not even close.  It's not even close. (Applause.)  It's not even close.  We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.  Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  (Applause.)  No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that’s the path to ruin.  Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead -- they call us.  (Applause.)
I mean, it's useful to level the set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions.
Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.  But that’s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and certainly not because of diminished American strength.  In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.  
The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.  Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition.  Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria -- client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit.  And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.
It’s up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system.  And to do that well it means that we’ve got to set priorities.
Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.  (Applause.)  Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.  They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country.  Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies.  We have to take them out./p>

But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.  Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages -- they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped.  But they do not threaten our national existence.  (Applause.)  That is the story ISIL wants to tell.  That’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.  We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions.  (Applause.)  We just need to call them what they are -- killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.  (Applause.)   
And that’s exactly what we’re doing.  For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology.  With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we’re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons.  We’re training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.  
If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL.  Take a vote.  (Applause.)  Take a vote.  But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.  If you doubt America’s commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden.  (Applause.)  Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.  When you come after Americans, we go after you.  (Applause.)  And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.  (Applause.)   
Our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there.  For even without ISIL, even without al Qaeda, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa, and Asia.  Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.  Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.  The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.  That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.
We also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions.  (Applause.)  That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us.  It’s the lesson of Vietnam; it's the lesson of Iraq -- and we should have learned it by now.  (Applause.)

Fortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.  It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.

That’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. 
That’s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.  And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.  (Applause.)
That’s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.  (Applause.)  Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million lives were saved. 
That’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.  It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America.  With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region; we do.  You want to show our strength in this new century?  Approve this agreement.  Give us the tools to enforce it.  It's the right thing to do.  (Applause.)
Let me give you another example.  Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, and set us back in Latin America.  That’s why we restored diplomatic relations -- (applause) -- opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.  (Applause.) So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over -- lift the embargo.  (Applause.)   
The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world -- except when we kill terrorists -- or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.  Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.  It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.
When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids.  When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick -- (applause) -- it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.  Right now, we’re on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS.  That's within our grasp.  (Applause.)  And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria -- something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.  (Applause.)
That's American strength.  That's American leadership.  And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.  That’s why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.  (Applause.)  It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.  (Applause.)  There’s a better way.  (Applause.)    
And that’s why we need to reject any politics -- any politics -- that targets people because of race or religion.  (Applause.)  Let me just say this.  This is not a matter of political correctness.  This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong.  The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity, and our openness, and the way we respect every faith.  
His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”  When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make us safer.  That’s not telling it like it is.  It’s just wrong.  (Applause.)  It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.  It makes it harder to achieve our goals.  It betrays who we are as a country.  (Applause.)  
“We the People.”  Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, and that's how we might perfect our Union.  And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight.
The future we want -- all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach.  But it will only happen if we work together.  It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.  It will only happen if we fix our politics.
A better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.  This is a big country -- different regions, different attitudes, different interests.  That’s one of our strengths, too.  Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.
But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.  It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice.  It doesn’t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.  Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise, or when even basic facts are contested, or when we listen only to those who agree with us.  Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention.  And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.
Too many Americans feel that way right now.  It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.
But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task -- or any President’s -- alone.  There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber, good people who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base.  I know; you’ve told me.  It's the worst-kept secret in Washington.  And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor. 
But that means if we want a better politics -- and I'm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, it’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President.  We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.  I think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.  (Applause.)  Let a bipartisan group do it.  (Applause.)  
We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections.  (Applause.)  And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution -- because it's a problem.  And most of you don't like raising money.  I know; I've done it.  (Applause.)  We’ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder.  (Applause.)  We need to modernize it for the way we live now.  (Applause.)  This is America:  We want to make it easier for people to participate.  And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.
But I can’t do these things on my own.  (Applause.)  Changes in our political process -- in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected -- that will only happen when the American people demand it.  It depends on you.  That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.  
What I’m suggesting is hard.  It’s a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is all the folks who are elected don't care, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.  But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.  Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.  And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.
We can’t afford to go down that path.  It won’t deliver the economy we want.  It will not produce the security we want.  But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.  
So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it -- our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen.  To vote.  To speak out.  To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. (Applause.)  We need every American to stay active in our public life -- and not just during election time -- so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.  
It is not easy.  Our brand of democracy is hard.  But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far.  Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as black or white, or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not as Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed.  Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word -- voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.  
And they’re out there, those voices.  They don’t get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they’re busy doing the work this country needs doing.  I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours.  I see you, the American people.  And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding. 

I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.  
I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early, and maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease.

	I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.
I see it in the American who served his time, and bad mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over -- and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance.  The protester determined to prove that justice matters -- and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.  (Applause.)  
I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on.
It’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught.  (Applause.)  
I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count -- because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.
That's the America I know.  That’s the country we love.   Clear-eyed.  Big-hearted.  Undaunted by challenge.  Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.  (Applause.)  That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future.  I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people.
And that’s why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong.  (Applause.) 

	Thank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

9:10 P.M. EST

	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

	Tonight marks the eighth year that I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it a little shorter.  (Applause.)  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.  (Laughter.)  I've been there.  I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.  (Laughter.)  

	And I understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.  But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform -- (applause) -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse.  (Applause.)  So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again.  

	But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead.  Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.  And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done.  Fixing a broken immigration system.  (Applause.)  Protecting our kids from gun violence.  (Applause.)  Equal pay for equal work.  (Applause.)  Paid leave.  (Applause.)  Raising the minimum wage. (Applause.)  All these things still matter to hardworking families.  They’re still the right thing to do.  And I won't let up until they get done.

	But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to just talk about next year.  I want to focus on the next five years, the next 10 years, and beyond.  I want to focus on our future.

	We live in a time of extraordinary change -- change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world.  It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.  It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.  It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality.  And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.

	America has been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights.  Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.  And each time, we overcame those fears.  We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.”  Instead we thought anew, and acted anew.  We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people.  And because we did -- because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril -- we emerged stronger and better than before.

	What was true then can be true now.  Our unique strengths as a nation -- our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.  

	In fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.  It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.  It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.

	But such progress is not inevitable.  It’s the result of choices we make together.  And we face such choices right now.  Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people?  Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together? 

	So let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer -- regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress. 

	First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?  (Applause.)  

	Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us -- especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?  (Applause.)  

	Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?  (Applause.)  

	And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?

	Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact:  The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.  (Applause.)  We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history.  (Applause.)  More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s, an unemployment rate cut in half.  Our auto industry just had its best year ever.  (Applause.)  That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.  And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.  (Applause.)  
Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.  (Applause.)  Now, what is true -- and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious -- is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit; changes that have not let up.  
Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated.  Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition.  As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise.  Companies have less loyalty to their communities.  And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.
All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing.  It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to.  And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.
For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody.  We’ve made progress.  But we need to make more.  And despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.
We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.  The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering.  In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and -- (applause) -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one.  We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.  (Applause.)
And we have to make college affordable for every American.  (Applause.)  No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.  We’ve already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower’s income.  And that's good.  But now, we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college.  (Applause.)  Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year.  (Applause.)  It's the right thing to do.  (Applause.)  
But a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.  It’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber.  (Laughter.)  For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.  Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool and they may have to retrain.  But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process.
That’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever.  We shouldn’t weaken them; we should strengthen them. (Applause.)  And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.  That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about.  It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business, you’ll still have coverage.  Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far.  (Applause.)  And in the process, health care inflation has slowed.  And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon.  (Applause.)  A little applause right there.  (Laughter.)  Just a guess.  But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security.  Say a hardworking American loses his job -- we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him.  If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.  And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.  That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.
I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.  America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up.  And I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children.  (Applause.)   
But there are some areas where we just have to be honest -- it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years.  And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.  (Applause.) And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make.
I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.  I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed.  There is red tape that needs to be cut.  (Applause.)  There you go!  Yes!  (Applause.)  But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense.  (Applause.)  Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.  Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.  (Applause.)  Immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.  It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.  (Applause.)
The point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.  The rules should work for them.  (Applause.)  And I'm not alone in this.  This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders.  (Applause.)  And I want to spread those best practices across America.  That's part of a brighter future.  (Applause.)  
In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.  And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer:  How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there.  (Laughter.)  We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight.  And 12 years later, we were walking on the moon.  (Applause.)    
Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA.  America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.  America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.  America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better world.  (Applause.)  That's who we are.
And over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.  We’ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.  (Applause.)  We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.  But we can do so much more. 
Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.  Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade. (Applause.)  So tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done.  And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.  (Applause.)  For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.  (Applause.)  
Medical research is critical.  We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.  (Applause.)  Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.  You will be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.  (Applause.) 
But even if -- even if the planet wasn’t at stake, even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record -- until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? (Applause.)  
Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.  Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.  On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal -- in jobs that pay better than average.  We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.   And meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.  (Applause.)  

Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either.  (Applause.) 
Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources.  Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future -- especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.  We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going.  That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities, and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.  (Applause.)  
Now, none of this is going to happen overnight.  And, yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.  But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, the planet we’ll preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve.  And it's within our grasp.  
Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world.  And that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.
I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air.  Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.  Let me tell you something.  The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Period. (Applause.)  Period.  It’s not even close.  It's not even close. (Applause.)  It's not even close.  We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.  Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  (Applause.)  No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that’s the path to ruin.  Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead -- they call us.  (Applause.)
I mean, it's useful to level the set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions.
Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.  But that’s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and certainly not because of diminished American strength.  In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.  
The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.  Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition.  Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria -- client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit.  And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.
It’s up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system.  And to do that well it means that we’ve got to set priorities.
Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.  (Applause.)  Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.  They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country.  Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies.  We have to take them out./p>

But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.  Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages -- they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped.  But they do not threaten our national existence.  (Applause.)  That is the story ISIL wants to tell.  That’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.  We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions.  (Applause.)  We just need to call them what they are -- killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.  (Applause.)   
And that’s exactly what we’re doing.  For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology.  With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we’re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons.  We’re training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.  
If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL.  Take a vote.  (Applause.)  Take a vote.  But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.  If you doubt America’s commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden.  (Applause.)  Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.  When you come after Americans, we go after you.  (Applause.)  And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.  (Applause.)   
Our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there.  For even without ISIL, even without al Qaeda, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa, and Asia.  Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.  Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.  The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.  That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.
We also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions.  (Applause.)  That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us.  It’s the lesson of Vietnam; it's the lesson of Iraq -- and we should have learned it by now.  (Applause.)

Fortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.  It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.

That’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. 
That’s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.  And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.  (Applause.)
That’s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.  (Applause.)  Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million lives were saved. 
That’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.  It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America.  With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region; we do.  You want to show our strength in this new century?  Approve this agreement.  Give us the tools to enforce it.  It's the right thing to do.  (Applause.)
Let me give you another example.  Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, and set us back in Latin America.  That’s why we restored diplomatic relations -- (applause) -- opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.  (Applause.) So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over -- lift the embargo.  (Applause.)   
The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world -- except when we kill terrorists -- or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.  Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.  It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.
When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids.  When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick -- (applause) -- it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.  Right now, we’re on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS.  That's within our grasp.  (Applause.)  And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria -- something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.  (Applause.)
That's American strength.  That's American leadership.  And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.  That’s why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.  (Applause.)  It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.  (Applause.)  There’s a better way.  (Applause.)    
And that’s why we need to reject any politics -- any politics -- that targets people because of race or religion.  (Applause.)  Let me just say this.  This is not a matter of political correctness.  This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong.  The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity, and our openness, and the way we respect every faith.  
His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”  When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make us safer.  That’s not telling it like it is.  It’s just wrong.  (Applause.)  It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.  It makes it harder to achieve our goals.  It betrays who we are as a country.  (Applause.)  
“We the People.”  Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, and that's how we might perfect our Union.  And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight.
The future we want -- all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach.  But it will only happen if we work together.  It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.  It will only happen if we fix our politics.
A better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.  This is a big country -- different regions, different attitudes, different interests.  That’s one of our strengths, too.  Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.
But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.  It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice.  It doesn’t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.  Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise, or when even basic facts are contested, or when we listen only to those who agree with us.  Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention.  And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.
Too many Americans feel that way right now.  It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.
But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task -- or any President’s -- alone.  There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber, good people who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base.  I know; you’ve told me.  It's the worst-kept secret in Washington.  And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor. 
But that means if we want a better politics -- and I'm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, it’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President.  We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.  I think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.  (Applause.)  Let a bipartisan group do it.  (Applause.)  
We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections.  (Applause.)  And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution -- because it's a problem.  And most of you don't like raising money.  I know; I've done it.  (Applause.)  We’ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder.  (Applause.)  We need to modernize it for the way we live now.  (Applause.)  This is America:  We want to make it easier for people to participate.  And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.
But I can’t do these things on my own.  (Applause.)  Changes in our political process -- in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected -- that will only happen when the American people demand it.  It depends on you.  That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.  
What I’m suggesting is hard.  It’s a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is all the folks who are elected don't care, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.  But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.  Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.  And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.
We can’t afford to go down that path.  It won’t deliver the economy we want.  It will not produce the security we want.  But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.  
So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it -- our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen.  To vote.  To speak out.  To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. (Applause.)  We need every American to stay active in our public life -- and not just during election time -- so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.  
It is not easy.  Our brand of democracy is hard.  But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far.  Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as black or white, or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not as Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed.  Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word -- voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.  
And they’re out there, those voices.  They don’t get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they’re busy doing the work this country needs doing.  I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours.  I see you, the American people.  And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding. 

I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.  
I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early, and maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease.

	I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.
I see it in the American who served his time, and bad mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over -- and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance.  The protester determined to prove that justice matters -- and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.  (Applause.)  
I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on.
It’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught.  (Applause.)  
I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count -- because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.
That's the America I know.  That’s the country we love.   Clear-eyed.  Big-hearted.  Undaunted by challenge.  Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.  (Applause.)  That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future.  I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people.
And that’s why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong.  (Applause.) 

	Thank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

	BARACK OBAMA

	PRESS GAGGLE
	BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST
	Aboard Air Force One
	En Route Omaha, Nebraska

	1:39 P.M. EST

	     MR. EARNEST:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to lovely Omaha, Nebraska.  The President is looking forward to the visit to highlight a couple of things. 

	Obviously, you had the opportunity to hear his State of the Union speech last night where the President indicated a desire to spend more time over the course of his last year in office talking directly to the American people, looking for more informal settings where he can talk to the public both about his agenda -- he has a vision for where we should take the country -- but also to hear more from people firsthand about some of the challenges facing the country, but also some of the opportunities that they see for themselves, their families, for their communities to capitalize on the future.

	     So when we arrive in Omaha, the President will be spending some time with a woman from the Omaha area who wrote the President a letter last year, and he'll do that before he addresses a larger group of Nebraskans at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.  So the President is really looking forward to this stop. 

	Over the course of his remarks, which you’ll obviously see, one of the things the President is going to talk about is how strongly Nebraska has bounced back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.  The unemployment rate in the state of Nebraska is below 3 percent, and it's clear the people in Nebraska are doing something right when it comes to their economy.  So you certainly can expect to hear the President talk a little bit about that.

	     Two other things I want to mention before I get to your questions -- obviously you saw that the President had the opportunity to visit briefly with King Abdullah of Jordan prior to boarding the aircraft.  The President only spent a couple of minutes with him, but it was an opportunity for the President to greet him.  Yesterday, the Vice President sat down and had breakfast with King Abdullah of Jordan.  I also note that the King, over the course of his visit, also had the opportunity to meet with other senior members of the President’s national security team, as well.

	     Obviously, Jordan is an important partner when it comes to our collective efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.  Jordan also is assuming a significant burden in terms of caring for the basic humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who are fleeing violence in that country.  The United States has offered significant support to Jordan as they have borne that burden, and this is an indication of the important and enduring relationship between our two countries.

	    

	     Prior to leaving the White House today, the President also had the opportunity to speak on the telephone with President Putin of Russia.  We'll get you a more formal readout of that conversation -- that will be distributed by my colleagues at the White House -- but as usual, they spent a significant portion of their time discussing the need for the Russians to live up to the commitments that they made in Minsk to end their support for the separatists that are destabilizing Ukraine right now. 

	There was some discussion of other issues, including the ongoing efforts to try to reach a -- bring about a political transition inside of Syria.  Both the United States and Russia have a vested interest in seeing that occur.  And we previously complimented Russia for the constructive role that they played in this rather painstaking process.  And the two leaders had the opportunity to discuss that. 

	But as I mentioned, there will be a more -- slightly more detailed readout that will come from my colleagues back at the White House on paper later today.

	So, with that, I can go to your questions.

	Q    Can you give us a little bit more of a tick-tock about what happened with the sailors?  And has the President spoken with his -- with any of them, or with his senior advisors about this today?  Can you give us a little insight into that?

	MR. EARNEST:  Well, I can tell you the President has been updated on a regular basis by members of his national security team about that situation.  And we're obviously pleased that the Iranians followed through on their commitment to promptly allow our sailors to continue their journey. 

	We're appreciative of the key role that Secretary Kerry played in securing this outcome.  I do think it underscores the value of the diplomatic line of communication that’s been opened between Secretary Kerry and his counterpart.  It certainly has not resolved the long list of concerns that we have with Iran’s behavior.  That list includes threatening Israel, developing ballistic missiles in violation of a variety of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and supporting terrorism.  But today’s outcome is a good reminder that this kind of diplomatic engagement -- that has been the target of some criticism -- actually does advance the interests of the United States and enhances our national security.

	     Q    Is the President satisfied with how Iran handled it?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Well, I guess -- let me answer the other part of your question, which is that there is more work being done to understand exactly how the situation came about.  And that work is underway.  So there’s not a whole lot more that I can share with you in terms of the details of this situation.  But we’re obviously gathering more information -- the Department of Defense is gathering more information, so we can get a better picture of what exactly led to these individuals ending up -- these sailors ending up in Iranian custody.  And we’re certainly going to want to understand more about how they were treated and what transpired while they were in the hands of the Iranians.  So there’s not that much that I can say about that now, principally because we’re still understanding exactly what transpired.

	     Q    Do you know if the President saw the photos or video of them being arrested or detained, or whatever term you want to use?  And did he have a reaction to them?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I don’t know if he’s seen the photos, to be honest with you.

	     Q    In an interview, the Vice President said this morning that the U.S. did not apologize in order to get their release, but do you know if the idea of having the U.S. apologize was ever discussed, or was that ever something that Iran wanted?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I'm not aware that the prospect of the United States issuing a formal apology was ever discussed.  It certainly did not occur.

	     Q    -- think the sailors should have been detained in the first place?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Well, what we have been focused on primarily is the safety of our soldiers -- of our sailors.  We obviously were pleased that they were released promptly and allowed to continue their journey.  We’ve received assurances from the Iranians that that is what would happen, and it did.

	     As it relates to the details of the circumstances that led to them being taken into custody by the Iranians and what exactly transpired while they were in custody, we’re still trying to learn more about how exactly that all happened.  And so that’s why I’m reluctant to say much more about it at this point.

	     Q    Can you tell us whether President Obama saw Governor Haley’s response to his State of the Union address or is aware of what she said, and what he thinks about it?  I mean, not the part where she criticized him, but the part we all care about -- the rest of it.  (Laughter.) 

	     MR. EARNEST:  The President did not get a chance to watch it live.  We were still traveling back from the Capitol while she was delivering the response.  The President has read news accounts of it, so he certainly is aware of her response. 

	Look, I think at the White House we took note of it for the same reasons that you did.  She was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans -- leading Republicans have been unwilling to do, which is to actually articulate a commitment to some core American values that some leading Republican presidential candidates are speaking out against, or at least speaking in a way that contradicts those values.  And her willingness to stand up and speak out against that took some courage, and it was rather conspicuous, given the willingness of a lot of other leading Republicans to either ignore it or to try to sweep it under the rug.  In some cases, we’ve seen leading Republicans be totally coopted by it. 

	Look, that doesn’t mean that we agree with Governor Haley on everything; we surely don’t.  But her willingness to stand up for some important principles was noted, and it took courage.  And for that, she deserves credit.

	     Q    Back to the Omaha portion of this.  You mentioned Nebraska’s economic situation being much better than in many parts of the country.  To what extent can you tie that to the administration’s policies?  And then, also, does he have any plans to do anything with Warren Buffett while he’s in town?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I’m certainly no expert on Nebraska’s economy. I think there are a number of things that have contributed to the kind of durable economy in Nebraska that we’ve seen.  A couple of things come to mind.  The first is, we’re producing more oil and natural gas in the United States than we ever have before.  I think that is consistent with the kind of approach that we have seen to energy policy that the President has pursued.  There also clearly is a growing renewable energy industry in Nebraska, and that’s the kind of energy future that the President envisions for our economy and for our country. 

	And I think a state like Nebraska is a pretty good indication of how communities all across the country can benefit from smart investments in wind energy production, in particular. We’ve seen rural communities all across the country actually be pretty strong when it comes -- under the President’s leadership, as a result of the President’s policies.  Nebraska is also a state that would benefit significantly from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that the administration is seeking to negotiate.

	     So despite the kind of economic strength that we already see in Nebraska, the President believes that there’s more that we can do that would make the people of Nebraska even more prosperous.  And the President is pursuing policies that are consistent with that.

	     You asked about Mr. Buffett.  I don’t know Mr. Buffett’s schedule today.  The President obviously knows Mr. Buffett pretty well, and I think if there’s an opportunity for the President to visit with Mr. Buffett today, I’m sure the President will take advantage of it.

	     Q    We reported on this meeting with the families of the slain police officer.  Can you tell us any more about what’s going to happen with that meeting?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I know that meeting will occur, but I don’t have a lot more details for you now.  Why don’t we touch base after the meeting has transpired, and we’ll see if I can get you some more information.

	     Q    -- the police officer’s family also?  The police officer’s family, which has been reported --

	     MR. EARNEST:  Yes.  That's what he asked about.

	     Q    Back to Iran and the detaining of U.S. sailors -- why didn’t the President mention it in the State of the Union address?  And you did tick off quite a few concerns that the administration continues to have with Iran.  Is this the latest in a series of moves that would consider the trustworthiness of Iran as you go forward with the Iranian nuclear deal, which I assume is going to be finalized as the JCPOA is finalized this weekend, I hear.

	     MR. EARNEST:  As it relates to the address last night, at the White House we reached the conclusion that further elevating the situation by including it in the State of the Union address would not be the most effective way for us to assure the safe return of our sailors.  And I think the outcome, which is the release of the sailors just hours after the President completed his address is a pretty powerful endorsement of that strategy.

	     At this point, I would not have any reason to think that this incident would have an impact on the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  As we’ve discussed earlier, the timing of when this so-called implementation day will occur is dependent primarily on the Iranians, because we have been resolute about the fact that the Iranians will not benefit from sanctions relief unless and until they have fulfilled every single commitment that they made in the context of the joint agreement.  And we are going to require that they provide sufficient access to international inspectors so that those steps can be independently verified prior to any sanctions relief being offered to the Iranians.

	     So that means that we’re still waiting on Iran to take all the steps that they are required to take, and for international experts to confirm that those commitments have been fulfilled consistent with the agreement.  And only after both of those things have transpired will we move forward with formalizing our part of the bargain, which is offering Iran relief from the sanctions that were put in place as a result of their nuclear program.

	     As we’ve discussed previously, this agreement won’t have any impact on the existing sanctions that are related to some other aspects of Iran’s nefarious behavior, including their support for terrorism and their new development of their ballistic missile program.

	     Q    Josh, would the President have delivered a different address if Donald Trump were not the leading candidate, or one of the leading candidates for President on the Republican side?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Let me try to answer your question this way.  For those of you who have been covering the President for a while now -- and as I sort of look around the group here, I think many of you have -- I think you can draw a pretty straight line from the speech that the President delivered at the Democratic Convention in Boston in July of 2004 through the address that the President delivered eight years and two weeks ago in Des Moines, Iowa, on the night of the Iowa caucus, through to his first and second inaugural addresses.  In each of those high-profile addresses, the President offered up a fundamentally optimistic vision for the country.  And he delivered those addresses -- at least a couple of those addresses at times when people had reason not to be feeling particularly optimistic. 

	At least one of those addresses -- I have the first inaugural in mind -- was delivered in the depths of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.  And even looking at that address, you sensed the kind of optimism and possibility that the President senses about this country’s future.

	     And I do think that last night’s speech was a reiteration of that vision for the country.  And the vast majority of those speeches were delivered before several of the current Republican candidates for president walked across the national political stage -- not just Mr. Trump, but even people like Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.

	     Q    It’s hard not to connect some of his comments with Mr. Trump.

	     MR. EARNEST:  Well, it’s hard not to see the stark contrast in approach -- I would readily acknowledge that.  I think that was pretty obvious even to people who are only sort of paying attention to politics.  And I think the President alluded to that last night, that elections are about making choices, and the American people will ultimately have the opportunity to make their own choice.  And I feel confident that, while Democrats pride ourselves in having a big tent party and representing and incorporating a lot of different views into our party, that the core values and principles of what it means to be a Democrat are consistent with the optimism that the President articulated last night. 

	And that does stand in stark contrast to the core message that’s being delivered by basically all of the Republican candidates for president.  I don’t think that’s much of an exaggeration.  I know that Mr. Trump gets most of the attention, but again, we’re seeing all of the Republican candidates make a rather overt appeal to people’s anxieties and fears and insecurities about the future.

	     And I’m not in a position to talk about the strategy that that they’re pursuing for their campaign, but I am in a position to note that the kind of vision that they have for the country is quite different than the kind of vision and leadership that the President has been talking about for more than a decade now. 

	     Q    What do you think about the Republican Party that they tapped someone who they knew would come out swinging against Donald Trump to be their response?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Well, look, you guys have written about how -- that there seem to be a number of differences of opinion inside the Republican Party right now.  What consequences that has to the election, that's something for you guys to analyze in advance and for us all to consider after Election Day has occurred.

	     But, look, what the President did yesterday was -- last night was to articulate a vision for governing the country.  And it was not rooted in opposition to another person or another politician, or even another politician’s views.  What the President laid out yesterday reflects what he thinks is the best about this country and what he thinks is the most effective approach any American President can take to leading the greatest country on Earth.

	     This issue of Republicans in Congress, too -- they seem to be struggling in terms of putting together and articulating their own vision of a government -- or a governing agenda that is something other than opposing the President’s agenda.  There is no better example of that than citing what House Republicans did just within the last week.  They voted for like the 60th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  They haven’t voted on their own affirmative health care proposal even once.  And in some ways, that is actually the clearest illustration of the challenge that’s facing the Republican Party.

	     And the reason that that’s a challenge for them is -- the whole reason that we have a political debate in this country is that people have the opportunity to put forward their ideas; they defend them in the public square; they advocate for them; they marshal evidence; they present data to try to persuade people that the vision that they’re offering up is in the best interest of the country.  And Republicans seem to be struggling rather mightily right now in articulating their own coherent agenda for how they would lead the country.

	     But again, that is a challenge that is facing not just Republicans who aspire to the White House; this is a significant challenge for Republicans that right now are entrusted with majorities in both the House and the Senate.

	     Q    As you well know, Omaha is practically within shouting distance of Iowa.  I think it's an Iowa media market.  Is the President’s visit -- did that factor into today’s visit in terms of trying to influence the debate in Iowa?  And is this indicative of how he’ll try to influence the political debate over the course of the year, as he talked about doing last night?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I think I would describe the geographic circumstance as an appealing side benefit of this trip.  I’m confident that -- the President wanted to travel to a state that demonstrated his commitment to talking to people other than just his supporters.  And going to a state like Nebraska that didn’t give him any electoral votes in 2012, gave him a single electoral vote in 2008, I think is a pretty good way for the President to start that effort.

	     And that means not just giving a speech before large audiences -- although that’s a valuable way to give as many people as possible the opportunity to see the President makes a trip -- but it also should include a conversation, a real conversation with somebody local.  And so the President is going to do both of those things on this trip. 

	I don’t know how much of an impact it will have on the ongoing political debate across the river.  But, look, if that is -- if that geographic circumstance is a reason for more people to pay attention to what the President has to say today, then we obviously welcome it.

	    

	     Q    I think there is a bid to put the 2nd District back in the Democratic column in 2016 and try and do the “blue dot” again for the Democrats.

	     MR. EARNEST:  That will be -- I’ll just say that it was a point of pride to those of us who worked on the Obama campaign in 2008 that we did succeed in winning that electoral vote.  I suspect, though I don’t know, that when we get to the general election that whoever the Democratic candidate is would be similarly proud to earn the support of that congressional district.  But that’s something that somebody else is analyzing  -- but probably not yet.  We'll wait until the general election before we do that.

	     Q    He talked last night about one of the few regrets that he has is that the polarization, the division hasn’t gotten any better; maybe worse.  If you contrast his visit from 2008 when there was kind of this soaring message of unity to today, and you look at 2008 when he did carry the district -- 2012, much different story -- any reflections on kind of how you see that in Omaha, the kind of division that has deepened over time?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Well, look, what the President was really talking about was more about the political division and debate in Washington.  It’s more profound there.  You could probably make a case that some of the partisan divisions and rancor has grown more significant across the country, too, but it’s been much more pronounced in Washington, D.C., at the core of our system of government, in the United States Congress.  That’s primarily what the President was referring to.

	     But, look, the President did acknowledge that that situation has worsened under his presidency.  And the President did acknowledge that that was the source of some regret.  And he acknowledged that a different President with greater skills, like somebody like President Lincoln or President Roosevelt, might have been more effective in bridging that divide.  But the President also said that in his remaining year in office that he was actually going to try to be better, that he was going to try to do more and be more effective in trying to bridge that divide. And we obviously would welcome that kind of sentiment from leaders on the other side of the aisle, too.

	     That might have been part of what Governor Haley was articulating.  But I hope she’s not the only one.

	     Q    -- he’s going to, do you know what the subject of her letter was, what she wrote to say to the President in the letter?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Let me pull together some more information on this.  I don't want to over-promise on what we can provide, because we're trying to walk the fine line of protecting this woman’s privacy, but obviously we're going to her house, right? So let me just figure out where we're going to draw that line, but, yes, I will get you some additional information.

	     Q    On that Putin call -- I know you're doing a readout later, but is there anything important we should ask here?  How long it lasted, or any agreement on a timeline, anything like that?

	     MR. EARNEST:  Not that I know of.

	     Q    Back to King Abdullah for a moment.  Is there something that the administration wants him to do beyond what he’s doing, especially, perhaps, committing ground troops inside Syria?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I know there were a number of discussions that the King had while he was in D.C., not just with the Vice President, but also with Secretaries Kerry and Carter.  I don't have a specific readout of those conversations.  Let me just say that we obviously value the contribution that the Jordanians are already making to our counter-ISIL campaign.  The President himself has said that we're going to spend some time talking to all of our partners in that coalition about what more they can do to reinforce our efforts against ISIL, not just militarily, but in terms of other aspects of our campaign -- counter-finance, countering their radical online strategy. 

	     I will tell you that the President’s brief conversation with King Abdullah was not in pursuit of any specific request like that.  The President’s visit with King Abdullah was largely social.  We heard that King Abdullah was here at the airport at the same time that the President was, and so the President wanted to go by and say hello. 

	So for more details for any specific asks that were made of the King while he was visiting the United States over the last couple of days, I think you should check with my colleagues at the National Security Council who can give you more details about all of the conversations the King had while he was here.

	     Q    Do you know whether there was some discussion of committing to retake Palmyra -- 

	     MR. EARNEST:  I know that there has been a variety of discussions about how to enhance the ground forces with whom our coalition can partner to more effectively push back ISIL.  But I don't know if that entailed any specific asks of the Jordanians. It might have, but I just don't know.

	     Q    On Medicaid, is there a Medicaid announcement coming up?  And is that going to be -- presumably that's what Louisiana is all about.

	     MR. EARNEST:  -- initiatives being discussed in both states. We're traveling to Nebraska.  There are a number of -- the Republican governor of Nebraska has indicated his strong opposition to expanding Medicaid.  However, there are a number of Republican state legislators who do believe that expanding Medicaid in Nebraska would be beneficial to the state.

	     Q    You just happen to have a list.  (Laughter.) 

	     MR. EARNEST:  I happen to have some statistics.  If Nebraska were to expand Medicaid, an additional 42,000 people who do not currently have insurance would be able to get health care coverage if Medicaid were expanded in Nebraska. 

	And that would actually have a significant positive impact on the lives of 42,000 Nebraska citizens.  But it would also have a positive impact on the Nebraska economy and a positive impact on the Nebraska budget.  Right now you’ve got a state budget that has to bear that burden.  And again, the benefits of Medicaid expansion is that the federal government is currently promising to take on the vast majority of that cost -- 90 percent of that cost. 

	     So that's why most states have concluded it's a no-brainer for states to make this decision, that there are important economic benefits, there are fiscal benefits to the state, and it can make a significant difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people.

	     That's a good transition because that's obviously why we were pleased to see the announcement from the Governor of Louisiana just yesterday, I believe, the newly-elected Democratic Governor of Louisiana has said that he would use his executive authority to expand Medicaid in Louisiana.  And the number of people in Louisiana who will benefit from this is significant.

	     Q    You’ve got that number right there.

	     MR. EARNEST:  I do.  In fact, it's so significant I've committed it to memory.  (Laughter.)  The Governor’s office says that about 300,000 people in Louisiana would benefit from this decision.  And that's why -- yes, just in Louisiana alone.  And that's why the Governor’s office has said that they want to work as aggressively and as quickly as they can to implement this expansion.

	     I haven't touched base with my HHS colleagues to determine exactly what sort of timeline would be realistic, but we are obviously going to join them in working hard to try to implement this as quickly as we can.  And we obviously are pretty excited about that decision from Governor Edwards.

	     Q    Will the Governor be at the event tomorrow?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I don't know yet, actually, but I'll try to find out in advance of tomorrow.  

	     Q    On the Nebraska Governor, he originally said that he was not going to be able to make the welcoming event, but apparently he was able to fit it into his schedule.  So any comment on -- are you guys pleased that he was able to rearrange things?

	     MR. EARNEST:  I don't know the details of his schedule or what changed in his schedule that allowed him to participate in one form or another today.  We’re obviously pleased that he’ll be at the airport to greet the President.  I know that the President is looking forward to meeting him.

	     Again, traditionally, when the President travels across the country, he is met at the airport by a local leader, often the governor, whether that person is in the President’s party or not. And we’re obviously pleased that -- I think Governor Ricketts is pursuing the kind of political tradition that Nebraskans have long adhered to, that regardless of political party that when you’re the governor of the state and the President of the United States is coming to visit, then you extend to him a courteous and proper Midwestern welcome.

	     And so, again, Governor Ricketts I’m sure would be the first to say that there are a lot of -- plenty of things he disagrees with the President about, but, look, you’ve got to give credit to Governor Ricketts for putting aside those differences and extending the kind of courtesy to the President of the United States that I think the vast majority of Nebraskans would expect.

	     Good.  Thanks, guys.  It will be a fun trip.

	THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Omaha!  (Applause.)  Thank you!  (Applause.)  Oh!  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Well, thank you so much.  Thank you, Omaha.  (Applause.)  That's so nice, thank you.  Go, Mavericks!  (Applause.)  This is quite a place you got here.  (Applause.)  It’s still got the new-arena smell.  (Laughter.)  A perfect spot for your hockey team to stage another run to the Frozen Four.  (Applause.)

	I want to start off by thanking Lisa for the wonderful introduction -- and her hospitality in her living room.  Give her a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  She did a great job.  Before I came here I stopped over at Lisa’s place, with her husband and her one-year-old.  And he was fired up and ready to go.  (Laughter.)  He was bouncing around -- and I was getting tired just watching him.  (Laughter.)

	I also want to thank Dr. Hank Bounds, the President of the University of Nebraska.  (Applause.)  Dr. John Christensen, Chancellor here at UNO.  (Applause.)  We've got Lieutenant Governor Mike Foley here; your former Senator, Ben Nelson -- (applause) -- your Congressman, Brad Ashford.  (Applause.)  And all of you are here.  (Applause.)  This is a pretty good crowd!

	AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Love you!

	THE PRESIDENT:  I love you back.  (Applause.)  I do.  I do. I do.  This is so nice -- what a wonderful welcome.  Those of you who have seats, though, feel free to sit down.  It's okay.  (Laughter.)  But if you want to stay standing, that's fine, too. (Applause.)

	Last night, I gave my final State of the Union address. (Applause.)  I promised that it was going to be shorter, and then it ended up just being like a minute shorter.  (Laughter.)  So, technically, it was shorter, but it wasn’t like as short as I was planning.  But today, I'm definitely going to be shorter.

	AUDIENCE:  Noooo --

	THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  (Laughter.)  But whenever I give a State of the Union I want to get out of Washington and talk to people out in the country.  And so the first place I decided to visit was Omaha.  (Applause.)  Part of the reason I wanted to come here is I've got a lot of friends, like Brad and others, and I had not been here in a while.  So the last time I was here for an event in Omaha was 2008.  (Applause.)  And that year, in the primary, I won the Nebraska caucus.  (Applause.)  And there were people -- I saw some signs -- who called the city “Obamaha.”  (Applause.)

	And then, in November of 2008, Joe Biden and I won one electoral vote here -- (applause) which I was pretty excited about.  And then four years later, I got whupped all across this state.  (Laughter.)  It was not pretty.  It was not pretty.  But I love Nebraska anyway.  (Applause.)  There’s something about the Midwest and its people and the way that folks pull together and the degree to which, in this state, the kind of politics I talked about last night has always been there.  There’s a civility and people treating each other with respect.

	 

	And so that's part of the reason why I wanted to come back here today, because, as I said last night, America is at its best when we see each other as one people --(applause) -- not Democrats first, not Republicans first, but Americans first.  That's our priority.

	And that's harder to do during political season.  I understand that.  And you hear a bunch of folks right across the river -- (laughter) -- and I don't know if the TV ads drift over here but -- (laughter) -- they’re kind of depressing.  (Laughter.)  I mean, I like talking about hope and all the good stuff that was going on, and then you look at some of these ads and it's some doom and some gloom.  (Laughter.)

	AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Four more years!

	THE PRESIDENT:  It's like everybody is running around and saying America is in decline, and everything is scary, and let’s find somebody to blame.  And the point I wanted to make, the core thing I wanted to say last night was that’s not the spirit that brought America so far.  That's not how we traveled so far.  (Applause.)  And it’s not what I see every day.  That's not what I see in communities and neighborhoods all across this country.

	Now, what’s true is we’re all living through a time of extraordinary change, and that’s always a little bit unsettling. And that's what Lisa wrote to me about -- at 4:00 a.m., which I wanted to tell Lisa, you should get some sleep.  (Laughter.)  But when you have a one-year-old, that’s what happens.  (Laughter.)  But you heard Lisa talk about she was wondering whether the world she grew up in would be just as prosperous and secure for her new baby as it was for her.

	But I want everybody to remember, America has been through big changes before.  And each time, we overcame our fears and we overcame our challenges.  Each time, we made change work for us. And each time, we emerged stronger and better than we were before.  (Applause.)  That’s what we do as Americans.  We go through war and depression, and all kinds of social and economic changes.  But each time, we’ve ended up better than we were before.

	Now, here’s the thing -- progress is not inevitable.  We got to work for it -- somebody is stealing my lines up here.  (Laughter.)  It’s the result of the choices that we have to make together.  And we’ve got to make some choices.  Do we respond to these changes with fear and do we turn on each other, or do we face the future with confidence in who we are, and what we stand for, and all the incredible things we can get done together?  (Applause.)

	So I just want to repeat the four big questions that I think we have to answer as a country.  And this is true whether you’re a Democrat, whether you’re a Republican.  You should think about and we have to have good answers for these four questions, regardless of who’s President, regardless of who controls Congress.

	Number one:  How do we make sure that this new economy works for everybody and not just some people?  (Applause.)  That’s question number one.  Number two, a related question:  How do we make sure that the spirit of innovation is used to solve some of our biggest challenges?  Number three:  How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming the world’s policeman?  (Applause.)  Number four, and maybe most important, is how do we have a politics that reflects the best in us and not the worst?  (Applause.)

	 

	So, on the economy, the first thing I try to remind people is, is think about where we were seven years ago.  We were -- because people forget -- and some of you were in grade school, and I had no gray hair.  (Laughter.)  So just to refresh your memory here for a second, we were in the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.  I was going back to look at my first State of the Union address, where I had to basically remind everybody that the money in their banks were safe.  I had to tell folks that that was -- that it was going to be okay.  That’s how fragile things were.

	But to paraphrase something that a friend of mine, who I guess people know around here, named Warren Buffett, once said -- (applause) -- no one ever benefitted by betting against America. And because of the grit and the resilience of the American people, because of hard work, because businesses got going, and because, frankly, we made some pretty good policy decisions, we now have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.  (Applause.)

	We’re in the midst of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history -- 14 million new jobs, around 40,000 right here in Omaha and the surrounding areas.  (Applause.)  Our national unemployment rate has been cut in half; it’s down to 5 percent.  It’s below 3 percent here in Nebraska.  (Applause.)  So our starting point has to be things are not terrible if your unemployment rate is at 5, and here in Omaha it’s below 3.

	Now, that does not mean that things haven’t been changing in profound ways.  And that’s also what I have to talk about.  Look, it’s changed to the point where even folks who have jobs, and even when the economy is growing, it’s harder for hardworking families to pull themselves out of poverty.  It’s harder for young people to start out on their careers, especially if they’ve got too much student loan debt.  (Applause.)  It’s tougher for workers to retire when they want to.  And there’s more inequality, and upward mobility has stalled.  And that offends our fundamental American belief that anybody who works hard can get ahead.  (Applause.)

	So people agree that real opportunity in the new economy requires everybody gets a great education and the training they need to land a good job.  And we’ve been working on that.  Over the past seven years, we’ve increased early childhood education, we’ve boosted high school graduation rates.  (Applause.)  We’re training and graduating more engineers and folks in other fields that we need to grow the economy.  But we’ve got to build on that progress.

	We’ve got to create opportunity for every child, which means pre-K for everybody.  (Applause.)  It means hands-on computer classes and math classes for the jobs of the future.  It means we should recruit and support and lift up great teachers who are doing great things for our kids.  (Applause.)  And it means that no student should be priced out of a college education, or loaded up with crippling debt.  (Applause.)

	So one of the things -- I didn’t try to list all the proposals I would like to see happen this year -- that’s why you go to the website, WhiteHouse.gov.  (Laughter.)  Which now works, I promise.  (Laughter.)  But we should guarantee two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student.  (Applause.)  That’s what real opportunity looks like in the new economy.

	 

	And then, once we’ve made sure everybody has a great education, as folks move throughout their lives, we’ve got to pair real opportunity with real security.  Basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.

	I was talking to Lisa’s dad and mom -- they were there -- and mostly they just wanted to talk about their adorable one-year-old grandson.  (Laughter.)  But they’ve been married for 44 years.  And dad had worked at a company that produces cement and ships it around the country, and he had worked there for 40 years, and he’s still working there.  And mom had been a nurse, and she retired.  But that kind of career path, where somebody is at one place for that long -- with good benefits, pension, health care -- that’s not going to be the pattern for most of the young people who are here today.

	And so the idea is, how do we make sure that even if you’re in this new economy where you’re changing jobs, you’re retraining, you’re starting your own business -- you have some basic security?  And that’s what the Affordable Care Act, by the way, is all about.  (Applause.)  That’s what it’s all about.  The goal wasn’t to replace employer-based care.  If you’ve got health care on the job, that’s great.  But if you lose your job, or you have to go back to school, or you want to start a new business, or you’re starting a new job and you’ve got a preexisting condition -- you should have health care options.  (Applause.)  You should have health care options.

	The same is true for some of the other programs that we had that haven’t been adapted to this new economy.  So I mentioned unemployment insurance right now.  When folks lose their jobs, unemployment insurance right now is not available for a lot of folks who had been working part-time or were temporary workers.  And if you take a job that doesn’t pay as much, sometimes you get penalized.  There should be a system of wage insurance so that you can still pay the bills and make up some of the difference as you transition into a new career.  (Applause.)

	And if we update the unemployment insurance system, that will encourage more folks to retrain for new, better-paying jobs. And when they change jobs, you should be able to save for your retirement even though you didn’t stay in one job for 30 years.  There should be a way for you to take your retirement savings with you.  (Applause.)

	Now, having said all that, somebody here said folks need bigger paychecks.  And part of what’s happened in this new economy is workers, frankly, just have less leverage, because companies move more.  It means that they can off-shore, they can move to a new state.  It means that a lot of times they’re under more severe competition.  And that gets a lot of folks frustrated.

	But part of what I’ve been concerned about as I’ve been listening to some of the political rhetoric is, let’s make sure that we don’t blame people who had nothing to do with the fact that wages aren’t growing.  Let’s try to solve the problem, but not misidentify the problem

	So, for example, let’s agree that working families will not get a bigger paycheck by us eliminating all the reforms that we made on Wall Street, or by letting Big Oil and hedge funds make their own rules.  That’s not going to help working families.  (Applause.)

	Now, as I said last night, families on food stamps did not cause the financial crisis.  (Applause.)  We’ve got to reform our broken immigration system, but immigrants are not the reason wages haven’t gone up. (Applause.)  Those decisions were made in boardrooms around the country.  You guys aren’t the ones who were -- I don’t think you’ve got off-shore accounts that allow you to dodge paying your taxes.  (Laughter.)  If you do, then the IRS wants to talk about you.  (Laughter.)

	But in this new economy, I believe workers, start-ups, small businesses -- they need more of a voice, more of a say, not less. The rules should work for working Americans.  And I’m going to spend some of the time this year lifting up a lot of companies who figured out if they pay good wages, provide good benefits, treat their customers well, are environmentally responsible, they can also make really good profits.  And it’s good for everybody. (Applause.)  It’s good for their shareholders and customers and communities.

	And a lot of our best corporate citizens are our most creative.  Which brings me to the second question that I raised yesterday -- how do we make sure that we continue to be an innovation economy, and how do we use innovation to meet some of our biggest challenges?

	Some of you heard me talk about our space program.  Sixty years ago, the Russians beat us to space.  And how did we respond?  We didn’t go, oh, my God, America is in decline and we’re doomed.  (Laughter.)  We didn’t say, ah, that’s not actually a spaceship up there, that’s a comet.  (Laughter and applause.)  We didn’t argue about the science, we didn’t shrink our R&D budget.  We built a space program almost overnight.  Twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.  (Applause.)

	I think my favorite movie last year was “The Martian.”  And I like space, but there was one line Matt Damon delivered where he said, I’m just going to science the heck out of this.  (Laughter.)  He didn’t say “heck,” but you get the point.  (Laughter.)  But that’s the American spirit, right?  “Okay, let’s solve the problem.”  Sometimes they’re tough problems, but we can figure this out.  We can figure this out.

	That’s the spirit we need today.  That’s why I put Joe Biden in charge of us figuring out how to cure cancer.  (Applause.)  He’s working with scientists and doctors, and obviously, with families who’ve been affected,, because he knows what they’ve gone through.

	That’s why we’ve got to make sure that American businesses produce and sell the energy of the future.  We should keep pressing forward with the clean energy that’s going to be creating new jobs for decades to come, and transition from dirty energy.  (Applause.)  We shouldn’t be subsidizing the past; we should invest in the future.  That puts us ahead of the curve.  (Applause.)

	And that’s how we’re going to keep leading the world to combat climate change and protect this planet, Lisa’s son, your kids and your grandkids.  (Applause.)  There’s nothing more important than making sure that future generations are able to enjoy the incredible bounty that God has given us.

	Third question:  How do we keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build all over the world?

	AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Keeping you as President!  (Applause.)

	THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, well, I can’t do that.  (Applause.)  I can’t do that because of the Constitution.  And I can’t do that because Michelle would kill me.  (Laughter and applause.)

	But, look, just as all this talk about how the American economy is terrible is just not true, it’s also not true when you hear folks talking about how America is so weak.  We aren’t just the strongest economy in the world, we are far and away the most powerful nation on the planet.  (Applause.)  Nobody can match our troops.  (Applause.)  Nobody can match what we can do to mobilize to solve problems around the world.

	And when I said that, by the way, last night, it was strange that some in the chamber didn’t agree and applaud with that.  I mean, that’s kind of a weird thing.  I didn’t say that it’s the strongest in the world because of me.  I mean, I understand why they wouldn’t want to give me credit for it -- which is true.  (Laughter.)  It’s because the United States of America, for 250 years, has been working to make us the strongest.

	But that should not be a controversial statement, right?  I mean, we can all clap about that.  (Applause.)  But that’s how crazy our politics has gotten sometimes.  That’s how crazy our politics has gotten -- where we now feel obliged to not root for America doing good.

	So when you hear people peddling this fiction about our enemies getting stronger, America getting weaker; when you hear folks say we can solve challenges just by looking meaner and talking tougher, or carpet-bombing wherever we want -- that’s just hot air.  It’s bluster.  (Applause.)  It’s not serious.  It’s not serious.  There’s another word for it that starts with a “B” -- it’s baloney.  (Laughter and applause.)

	Now, because we’re the strongest nation, we’ve got choices to make about how we use our power.  Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.  That’s what we’re doing with ISIL.  And for more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries.  We’re cutting off their financing.  We’re disrupting their plots. We’re stopping the flow of terrorist fighters.  We’re stamping out their ideology.  We’ve had 10,000 airstrikes.  We’re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons.  And they will learn the same lesson that terrorists before them have learned, which is when you come after Americans, we go after you.  (Applause.)  And it may take time, but our reach has not limits and we will get you.  We’ll get you.  (Applause.)

	But our foreign policy has to also have judgment and wisdom. And we can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into a crisis.  (Applause.)  So what I suggested last night is, we have to have a patient and disciplined strategy.  It’s got to use every element of our national power.  It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies.  But on a lot of world problems, from climate change to Ebola to Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, we’ll mobilize the world to work with us, and we make sure other countries pull their own weight so we’re not ending up sending our troops and spending our money every time there’s a problem around the world. (Applause.)  That’s not a lack of leadership; that’s common sense.  (Applause.)

	That’s how we led 200 nations to forge the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.  (Applause.)  That’s how we’ve gotten Iran to roll back its nuclear program.  They’re shipping out their nuclear materials right now.  (Applause.)

	That’s how we dealt with the Ebola crisis.  Our troops, our doctors, our development workers -- all outstanding, great courage -- they set up the logistics in West Africa so that other countries could then come in.  You had Chinese planes who couldn’t land before, because of our military setting up the landing strip, could then come in and support the effort to stamp out the spread of Ebola.  (Applause.)

	 

	And we couldn’t be prouder of the doctors and nurses, including here at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, who heroically treated and cared for patients.  (Applause.)  They saved lives not just here, but their courage saved lives around the world -- because they showed that, you know what, we can deal with this.  It’s a problem; it’s serious; we’re going to “science the heck out of it.”  (Laughter.)  And as a consequence, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people’s lives were saved.  (Applause.)

	That’s how America leads.  That’s the strength of our values.  That’s the power of our example.  (Applause.)

	And that’s why we have to reject any politics -- any politics -- that targets people because of their race or their religion. (Applause.)  That we have to reject.  That we have to reject.  (Applause.)  That we’ve got no room for.  (Applause.)

	I want to be clear about this.  This is not about being politically correct.  Now, since I’m on a college campus, I’ll tell you, I understand the argument about political correctness. There are times where folks don’t want to hear something and they just shut things down.  If somebody doesn’t agree with affirmative action, that’s a legitimate policy difference.  That doesn’t mean they’re racist.  If somebody has a disagreement about my economic policies, we can have a discussion about that. There should never be a situation on college campuses, for example, where people can’t speak at all.  Right?  (Applause.)  The First Amendment is important.  The First Amendment is valuable.  So we do have to be cautious about suggesting that anytime somebody says something we shut them down.

	But let me say this.  That doesn’t mean that you go around insulting people and thinking that that is clever, or that is being honest, or telling it straight.  No, that’s just being offensive.  (Applause.)  And that’s feeding some of our worst impulses.  And that does not make us strong.  That doesn’t make us strong.  (Applause.)  And that doesn’t help us fight terrorism, by the way.

	When politicians insult Muslims, including Muslim Americans -- including Muslim Americans who are in uniform, fighting on our behalf -- (applause) -- when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is bullied, that doesn’t make us safer.  It doesn’t make us safer.  The overwhelming majority of Muslim Americans and Muslims around the world, they’re our greatest allies in fighting this scourge of terrorism.  (Applause.)  So it doesn’t make us stronger.  It doesn’t help the effort.  It is wrong.  It betrays who we are as a country -- one people, who rise and fall together.  (Applause.)

	And when I think back to the arc of my entire political career, that's one thing that I believe more firmly than anything -- the fact that we are in this together.  That's what makes America great.  (Applause.)

	On the flight over here, Brad was telling me about his grandfather.  He said his grandfather was from Sweden.  And here in the Midwest, we got some folks of Swedish extraction.  And he was telling me about how his grandfather helped to set up an organization that was pretty well known at the time, back in the ‘30s and ‘40s, that was critical in fighting anti-Semitism and helping to bring Jews who were escaping Hitler and Nazi Germany. And I thought about Brad’s grandfather as just one example of all the stories in the history of this country that have made us the envy of the world, that have made us that “shining city on a hill.”

	 

	It's not just that we've got a big military.  It's not just that we've got a great economy.  It's that, in fits and starts, we figured out that if you treat everybody with respect, and you give everybody a shot, and everybody is working together, everybody is better off, everybody is stronger, everybody’s religion is protected.  (Applause.)  Everybody’s point of view is heard.  And that's what we have to remember.

	And that’s the last question that we have to answer -- and the most important one:  How do we infuse those principles into our politics?

	And I said this yesterday and I meant it.  I have really enjoyed being President, and I'm going to squeeze every last thing I can get out of it over this next year.  (Applause.)  But, look, probably my only big regret is that our parties are even more polarized, our politics are even more rancorous than they were seven years ago.  I'm going to keep on trying to do better to see if I can help break the fever here.  But it's not going to happen unless the American people send a clear message to their elected officials that that's not the kind of politics we want.  (Applause.)

	Look, I can say this as somebody who is never going to be on the ballot again -- there are some institutional things we've got to fix.  I think we have to end political gerrymandering -- (applause) -- so that congressmen aren't choosing their own voters.  Because that divides people.  If you’ve got a congressional district that's 80 percent Democrat, or 80 percent Republican, then you don't feel obliged to talk to people who don't agree with you -- and that's a problem.

	I think we have to end the just crazy amounts of money, much of it hidden, that is in our political system right now.  (Applause.)

	I believe that there should not be a single state in which we're making it harder for people to vote instead of easier.  (Applause.)  That doesn’t make any sense.  We’re not supposed to be a nation in which we discourage people from participating.  This country works by encouraging people to have a voice in their government -- (applause) -- which means that one of the things that I’m going to do over the course of this year is talk about why is it that we should have a single mom who’s got -- a nurse, let’s say, just like Lisa’s mom was -- she might have to take public transportation, get up early, go to her job, fix breakfast, now she’s got to pick up the kid or drop off the kid, come home.  And she’s got to vote on a Tuesday.  Why wouldn’t we want to make it so that she’s got a little more time to vote?  (Applause.)  Why are we making it impossible for her?

	And a lot of states are doing it.  A lot of states are doing it.  But that’s how it should be in every state.  Because none of these things that I just talked about can happen just by a President saying so -- any President.  Whoever replaces me is not going to be able to get all that done unless the American people demand it; when we as citizens demand it.  (Applause.)

	That’s what I said back in 2008.  I didn’t say, “Yes, I can,” I said “Yes, we can.”  (Applause.)  I asked you not to believe in my ability to bring about change; I asked to believe in your ability to bring about change.  (Applause.)

	And as I said last night, I know it’s hard.  Sometimes it’s frustrating.  But if we don’t accept that responsibility and that privilege of citizenship, and we accept the cynicism that says, ah, change can’t happen, and politics is pointless, and our voices and our actions don’t matter, then we’re going to forsake a better future, and the void will be filled by folks with money and power and special interests.  And they’re going to gain more and more control over decisions about whether young people are being sent to war.  They will be unfettered in pursuing policies that might lead to another economic crisis.  They might roll back rights that generations of American fought to secure.

	And then, when people get more and more frustrated because things don’t change, you start hearing voices that urge us to fall back into our respective tribes, and start scapegoating our fellow citizens -- people who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.  We can’t go down that path.  (Applause.)

	So, Omaha, whatever you believe -- whether you are a Democrat, or a Republican, or you don’t believe in political parties; whether you supported me or you didn’t -- our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligation as citizens -- to vote and to speak out -- (applause) -- and to stand up for others, especially those who are vulnerable, especially those who need help -- knowing that we are only here because somebody else did that for us.  (Applause.)  That’s how all of us are here.

	And when we do that, we will see the goodness and the decency and the optimism of people like Lisa reflecting itself in Washington.  That’s what we’re fighting for.  (Applause.)

	And I know it’s there because I see it in the American people every day.  (Applause.)  I see it every day.  I see it in all the students -- first-generation college students -- (applause) -- working hard, and scrimping and saving, and eating Ramen -- (laughter) -- and then eating some more Ramen -- just to get ahead.  And you’ve got teachers like Lisa, who come in early, and are helping young people cultivate a passion, or master a new skill that can change their lives.  And then you’ve got parents who are volunteering at local schools -- not just to help out their own kids but to help out their neighbor’s kids.  (Applause.)  And folks coaching Little League.  And businesses who are doing the right thing by their employees.  (Applause.)   And folks who are fighting on our behalf halfway around the world, and their families who are sacrificing alongside them.  (Applause.)  And folks working to help our veterans after they’ve been served.  Big-hearted, optimistic people.  They’re everywhere -- in coffee shops, and churches all across Nebraska, and in Louisiana, and in New York, and in Arizona, and every place else. Folks whose spirit has built America.  (Applause.)

	That’s why I’m hopeful about our future -- because of you, the American people.  Because of folks like all of you, I am absolutely confident that we’re going to get to where we need to go, and America will remain the greatest country on Earth.

	Thank you, everybody.  God bless you.  (Applause.)
