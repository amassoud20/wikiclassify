	In this week’s address, the Vice President wished Americans a Happy New Year, and asked that as we make resolutions to get healthier in 2015, we take the time to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Millions of people have already signed up for quality, affordable health care under the law, and there is still time to secure the peace of mind that comes with getting covered.

	From now until February 15th, you can sign up by logging on to HealthCare.gov, by speaking to someone on the phone through the 24/7 call center at 1-800-318-2596 -- where you can get assistance in 150 languages, or by  going in person to an enrollment event in your community.
