	The United States strongly condemns yesterday’s abhorrent ISIL attack in Diyala Province which purposefully and viciously targeted Iraqi civilians celebrating the Eid ul-Fitr holiday to mark the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan.  This latest attack is yet another painful example of the atrocities that the terrorist group ISIL continues to perpetrate against the people of Iraq.

	The United States remains steadfast in its commitment to work with Prime Minister Al-Abadi and our partners in Iraq and the international community to bring an end to ISIL’s depravity.  On behalf of the brave people of Diyala Province and all those Iraqis persecuted by ISIL, the United States will continue to support the Government of Iraq and its security forces to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist organization.

	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President explained the comprehensive, long-term deal announced earlier this week that will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  This agreement cuts off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon, implements unprecedented monitoring and inspections of Iran’s key nuclear facilities, and ensures that if Iran violates these terms, the strict sanctions previously imposed on the country will snap back into place.  This is a good deal that demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change that makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure.

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, July 18, 2015.
