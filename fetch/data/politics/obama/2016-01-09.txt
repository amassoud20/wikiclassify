	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President remarked on the incredible progress that has been made in the American auto industry.  Just seven years ago, the industry was on the brink of collapse, with plants closing and hundreds of thousands of workers getting laid off.  The President made a decision in his first couple of months in office to place his bet on American workers and American manufacturing, implementing a strategy to bring the American auto industry back.  Since then, Detroit-area unemployment has been cut by more than half, and automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs.  On January 20, the President will visit the Detroit Auto Show to see this progress firsthand.   Because the story of the auto industry is an apt illustration of all that America has accomplished in the past seven years, and all that it can do.
