	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President discussed a new rule announced by his Administration earlier this week to make it easier for communities to implement the Fair Housing Act.  For nearly 50 years the Fair Housing Act has prohibited landlords from turning away tenants because of race, religion, sex, national origin, or disability, and has made a big difference in this country.  This week the Administration announced new steps to provide communities with the tools they need to ensure that housing is fair, and that no American’s destiny is determined by a zipcode.

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, July 11, 2015.
