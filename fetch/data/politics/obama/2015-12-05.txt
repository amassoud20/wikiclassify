	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President offered his condolences to the families and community of the victims of the San Bernardino shooting.   He recognized the possibility that the two attackers may have been radicalized, a reminder to all of us that we need to work together to prevent people from falling victim to attempts by extremist organizations to encourage violence.  The President called on Congress to close the loophole that allows people on the No-Fly list to purchase guns, a simple and logical step that would make it harder for potential terrorists to acquire weapons.  And he reminded us that we cannot accept mass shootings like this one as routine in our country, and emphasized that above all else, his priority is the safety and security of the American people.

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, December 5, 2015.
