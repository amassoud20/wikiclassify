Well, look, I wouldn’t rule it out.  But these kinds of elections are a test.  And certainly the President will be considering the kinds of policies that are put forward by the Democratic candidate in those races.  And look, if both candidates support the kind of common-sense gun safety measures that the President does, then that’s great.  That means the President’s decision about who to support will then involve a consideration of a range of other issues.  A consideration of those other issues probably doesn’t stack up very well for a lot of congressional Republicans, including Senator Kirk and Senator Toomey.

	But, look, the President is serious about this.  And this certainly applies to presidential candidates, and it applies to candidates for both houses of Congress, but also to candidates further down the ballot, as well.
