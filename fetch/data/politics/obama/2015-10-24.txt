	WASHINGTON, DC — In this week's address, the President laid out the importance of serving as good stewards of the environment and maintaining the planet for generations to come.  Since taking office the President has prioritized protecting the places that make America special.  He has repeatedly said that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate, which is why he’s taken bold actions at home and encouraged historic action abroad on the issue.  In his address, he encouraged Congress to reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund which has protected more than 5 million acres of land for more than half a century, without costing taxpayers a dime.  Republicans in Congress let the fund expire despite strong bipartisan support. And he reminded us that we all have to do our part to address climate change, promote clean energy and energy efficiency, and ensure a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations. 

	The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, October 24, 2015.
